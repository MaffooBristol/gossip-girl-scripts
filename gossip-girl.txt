      PREVIOUSLY

  Rufus
You're one of my oldest friends.

  Lily
That's certainly not how it felt when you kissed me at Eleanor's.

  Lily
He proposed before we left, and I'm going to say yes.

  Rufus
I'm sure you'll make a beautiful bride.

  Vanessa, to Nate
Last night was strange, but very fun... Didn't we just say good-bye?

  Nate
Somehow, you screwing Blair for sport is my fault!

  Chuck
All right, I know how long you and I have been best friends, okay?

  Nate
No, it's not okay. From now on, you stay away from me.

  Serena
Georgina. What are you doing here?

  Georgina
I told you I was coming.

  Serena, to Chuck
Dan of all people cannot know Georgie.

  Dan
How about, um, dinner tonight with Sarah instead?

  Serena
Oh, Sarah again. What is she, your new girlfriend or something?

  Dan
She's new in town, and she does want to meet you.

  Georgina, to Serena
I'm Sarah.

  Serena
What do you want from me?

  Georgina
I want things to go back to how they were before that night, before things got so screwed up.

  Chuck
What's Georgina got on you? What's so bad you can't even tell me?

  Georgina, on video
"If you put the camera over there, she'll never know."

  Blair
You can tell me anything.

  Serena
I killed someone.

  Gossip Girl
"And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell. You know you love me. XOXO, Gossip Girl."

      END OF EPISODE

ACT ONE

[G walks through Manhattan, making call after call.]

  Gossip Girl
"In our modern age, when you can call someone and can't find them, you can pretty much be sure they'll get the message."

  Georgina
Hey S, it's Georgie. Listen, I know it's early, but I thought I'd ... So this is my third call. Where are you? ...It's me again. I've left you a couple messages, and you haven't called me back... I think we should hang out today. Friends hang out... Maybe you've lost your cell phone. Can't wait to see you...

  Gossip Girl
"But if they don't call you back, it usually means they don't want to be found."

[Humphrey Loft: Rufus strums his guitar as Lonelyboy enters.]

  Rufus
Hey, do you think "Track Me Down" should come before or after "Everytime"?

  Dan
Is the Rolling Stone thing tonight?

  Rufus
I guess I really am in one of the Top Ten Forgotten Bands of the '90s...

  Dan
It's true. I forgot.

  Rufus
Yeah, but a lot of people remember. There's a reason that issue was one of the highest selling of the year.

  Dan
And I'm proud, Dad, I really am. You got your follow-up article and a concert, surely followed by an overpriced CD sold at corporate coffeehouses for Gen Xers without taste buds or taste.

  Rufus
Hey, it's gonna be cool. I mean, they're even filming it for vh1.

  Dan
vh1 Classics. The "classic" is kind of important.

  Rufus
I'm classic! Uh-oh, no retort. Signs of a sleepless night. Disinterest in making your father feel old and irrelevant... That can only mean one thing. Girl trouble.

  Dan
Yeah, Serena and I, we had a fight last night. This new kind we keep having where she says something, and I know it's not the whole truth.

  Rufus
Well, have you asked her what's really on her mind?

  Dan
Only about ten thousand times, yeah.

  Rufus
Yeah, but did you really mean it? Most times, when people don't offer the truth, it's because they're afraid of what someone might think. And I don't know if you know this, but you can be a pretty judgmental guy.

  Dan
So you're saying that I should learn to be someone else around her so she can be herself around me?

  Rufus
Couldn't have said it better myself.

  Dan
Thank you, Dad. I'm gonna go find her right now.

  Rufus
See you tonight... Both of you.

[N surprises V outside the Coffeeshop]

  Nate
And here I thought I had your schedule memorized.

  Vanessa
I switched shifts and just got off. I'm Dan's Dad's roadie for the day, so I gotta bail in like five. Um, although I don't mind the stalking... When are you gonna ask me on a real date?

  Nate, answering his phone
Uh... Hold that thought. Sorry. Hello? Yeah. Yeah, okay, I'll be right there. Look, I'm sorry. I gotta go...

  Vanessa
So I heard.

  Nate
No, no, no. It's not what you think. It's just... What are you doing tonight?

  Vanessa
Uh, me, Lincoln Hawk, a dirty van and a lot of cables?

  Nate
Can I meet you at the concert?

  Vanessa
Can you be there at 7:30?

  Nate
It's a date.

  Vanessa
Finally!

  Nate
Text me the address.

[Palace Hotel: Bass Suite]

  Planner
The guests will be checked into their suites as soon as they arrive. The walk-through is at two, and the rehearsal dinner starts promptly at seven PM in the Reid salon. Oh, and don't forget. You have your interview with Rolling Stone in one hour.

  Bart
The interview. How could we forget?

  Dan
Hey, uh, excuse me, Mr. Bass, Ms. Van der Woodsen.

  Lily
Not for long, thank you very much.

  Bart
Morning, Daniel.

  Dan
Morning. Good morning. Have either of you seen Serena? She's not upstairs.

  Planner
Uh, ticktock, ticktock, ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

  Lily
No, Dan. Sorry.

  Dan
Okay. ...And her bed hasn't been slept in...

  Chuck, entering
Well, I knew housekeeping was hiring, but I had no idea their standards were so low.

  Dan
I hate that I have to ask you this, but have you seen Serena?

  Chuck
Oh, I've seen lots of Serena.

[B calls him.]

  Chuck, shutting a door in Dan's face
Are you drunk dialing again? ...No, Serena didn't come home last night. I thought she was with you.

[N boards the elevator at B's house; C enters at the last second.]

  Nate
Hey.

  Chuck
Hey.

[Awkward. When they enter the residence, it's empty.]

  Chuck
Maybe this is Blair's idea of a perverse double date.

  Dorota
Miss Blair asks that you should wait there. She's on her way now.

  Nate
She's not even here?

  Chuck, sitting
Well, this oughta be good.

[G carries coffee toward the Palace.]

  Georgina
You're not calling me back, and you're not picking up. I thought you understood me, but maybe I should make myself a little more clear and come to you. We can talk about it over coffee. I brought it just the way you like it...dark but sweet.

  Georgina, spotting Dan in the courtyard
Oh, no...

  Dan
Hey, Sarah!

  Georgina, fake-laughing
Dan! Hey! Oh, my gosh! What a coincidence.

  Dan
Yeah. What ... what are you doing here?

  Georgina
Oh, um, I actually have an old friend from Portland staying here.

  Dan
Oh, okay.

  Georgina
What are you doing here?

  Dan
Oh, I just... I came looking for Serena, but she, uh, apparently didn't come home last night, so I'm just... I don't know. I'm trying to figure out what to think. She's been... Well, let's just say she's not been herself lately. So I... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what to do exactly.

  Georgina
Why don't you try giving her a call again? And when she sees it's you calling, she'll immediately pick up and tell you all about it.

[Lonelyboy's phone rings.]

  Dan, showing G and answering
Hey. Hey, I've been looking all over for you!

  Drew
Hey, is this Dan?

  Dan
Who's this?

  Drew
My name's Drew. I'm the bartender at 1OAK. Some girl left this phone here last night, it's been ringing off the hook all morning. You were the first number on the speed dial...

  Dan
"Some girl"? What... What girl?

  Drew
Tall, blonde, left here around two with three guys. Skipped out on her tab, which was pretty substan...

[Lonelyboy hangs up.]

  Georgina
Hey. What is it?
Gossip Girl:"Spotted: Lonelyboy on the Upper East Side, learning the lesson that nothing stays missing for long..."

  Dan
It's nothing. Nothing.

[B enters the Waldorf residence.]

  Gossip Girl
"...Things always turn up, for better..."

  Nate
Well, is something actually wrong, or is this just some ploy to get us both here?

  Blair
I meant what I said on the phone. I need your help. We need your help.

[B leads them back to the elevator: S is in a total shambles on the floor.]

  Gossip Girl
"...Or for worse."

  Nate
Oh my God. You okay? ... What's wrong with her?

  Blair
Take her upstairs, get her upstairs. Dorota! Coffee. Fast.


      ACT TWO

[B carries S to her bathroom.]

  Blair
Come on, Serena. We have to get her in the shower.

  Serena
No, I just want to sleep.

  Blair
Here. No. Come on, come on.

  Serena
Why won't you let me sleep?

  Blair
We have to keep her talking and awake. Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go. Dorota, will you please get her a fresh change of clothes and a bathrobe?

  Dorota
Of course, Miss Blair.

  Chuck, entering with shopping bags
So we have every hangover cure known to man, plus bagels. They should help soak up the alcohol and whatever else she took...

  Blair
Thank you, I'll take it from here. Come on. Come on. Come on, Serena. Help me out.

[C watches B undress S; N closes the door on the girls.]

  Serena
B, it's cold! It's cold!

  Chuck
Just like old times.

  Nate
You know, why do I get the feeling you're actually enjoying this?

[S barfs loudly inside the bathroom.]

  Chuck
Call me sentimental?

  Blair
Ugh. I may not need those bagels after all.

  Nate
What's going on with her?

  Blair
She was here last night, scared. She... She told me something totally crazy, but was too freaked out to find the words to explain it. I went upstairs to find my mom's Valium to calm her down, but when I got back, she was gone. It took me all night to find her.

  Chuck
What exactly did she say to you?

  Blair
That's ... beside the point. We're here to help Serena, no matter what the problem is.

[While V and Rufus unload the van, another guy is reading the Post, headline "BEAUTY BAGS BASS," with a picture of Lily.]

  Rufus
Hey, could you maybe read that somewhere else? ...I don't like the Post.

  Vanessa
Is that why you subscribe?

  Rufus
Another thing I don't like... My son, depressed. I don't know if you've talked to him recently...

  Vanessa
We've talked.

  Rufus
He and Serena... Should I be worried?

  Vanessa
It's been a little bumpy lately, sure. I think the most recent bump is our friend Sarah. Serena's a little jealous, but Sarah's cool, so as soon as Serena gets to know her, everything will be fine.

[A giant poster of Rufus unfurls down the building.]

  Vanessa
I love that picture of you!

  Rufus
Yeah. Me too...

[At the Palace, the Rolling Stone reporter takes out the same picture.]

  Reporter
Tell me where you took this photograph, what undoubtedly could be called the band's most well-known image?

  Lily
Uh, well, I wouldn't go that far.

  Reporter
Well, I would. It's positively iconic. Were you and Rufus Humphrey already involved when you took it?

  Lily
Excuse me?

  Reporter
Rufus Humphrey, lead singer of Lincoln Hawk? Or... Was this before or after...?

  Lily
Oh, well, I simply don't feel comfortable discussing anything other than my work.

  Reporter
I was talking about your work. Why'd you give up photography? Was it too hard to continue shooting after you had broken his heart?

[There's a knock at the door.]

  Lily
Um, just -- just a moment, please.

  Dan, at the door
Oh. You know, I see I'm interrupting, so I'll ...

  Lily
No, I have to say I have ... never been happier to see you, Dan.

  Dan
Oh. Well, I've been waiting downstairs for Serena. I... I figured she has to come home... Sometime soon. So have you heard from her?

  Lily
Have you tried calling?

  Dan
Pretty sure she lost her phone.

  Lily
Well, Charles said he was going over to Blair's to pick her up right after you left earlier. Maybe try there?

  Dan
Ah, yes. "Charles." Charles, of course. Thank you so much.

  Lily, returning to reporter
Listen, I really appreciate your coming all the way to the Palace to conduct this interview, but I'm simply going to have to ask you to leave, because I have a wedding to attend. My own.

  Reporter
Do you think you were able to take such incredible photos of Rufus Humphrey because of how much you were in love with him?

  Lily
Well, I wasn't in love with him. Um... That much.

  Reporter
Thank you for your time.

  Lily
Mm.

[B barely spares Lonelyboy a glance as he enters the Waldorf house.]

  Blair
Dorota, can you bring the towels upstairs?

  Nate, coming downstairs
What's taking so long?

  Dan
Huh. Guess I missed a chapter...

[C enters, with a platter of bagels.]

  Dan
Or ... four. Don't, ah, don't all of you hate each other?

  Blair
Yes.

  Nate
Absolutely.

  Chuck
No.

  Dan
Well, that's fascinating and ripe for a psychiatrist's case study somewhere but, um, I am looking for Serena.

  Chuck
She's not here.

  Dan
I think she is.

  Blair
No, she just left. You must've crossed paths.

  Dan
I... I don't believe you.

  Blair, worried
Fine. I... I didn't want to have to tell you this, but...she doesn't want to see you.

  Dan
Come on. Really?

  Blair
Yes. Really.

  Dan, heading for the stairs
Serena!

  Nate
She's telling the truth.

  Dan
Are you really gonna stop me from seeing my girlfriend?

[Dan tries to get past them.]

  Chuck
Whoa, man.

  Dan
Come on.

  Serena, on the stairs
What are you doing?

  Blair
S?

  Serena
It's okay.

[S leads him aside.]

  Dan, nearly crying
What's happening?

  Serena
Dan...

  Dan
Something is going on, and I just want to be let in on what it is.

  Serena
It's hard to explain...

  Dan
Well... Why don't I make it easy for you? I know you're keeping something from me, and I'm sick of being the only one you don't talk to about it.

  Serena
I'm not talking to anyone.

  Dan
Then what are they doing here, while... While I get a call from a bartender who says you left a bar at two in morning with a bunch of guys? What guys, Serena? Who... Who were they?

  Serena, mumbling
I don't know.

  Dan
Did something happen last night?

  Serena
Please don't...

  Dan
Is that... Is that what you're so afraid to tell me? That you cheated on me? Did you cheat on me last night? All I need is a yes or a no, did you sleep with someone else?

  Serena, without looking at him
Yes. Yeah.

  Dan
I'm done. I'm done.

[Lonelyboy gets on the elevator, and "Sarah" calls.]

  Dan
...Hey.

  Georgina
Hey! Did you find Serena?

  Dan
Yeah, but I ... I, uh, kinda wish I hadn't.

  Georgina
That doesn't sound so good. I'm just in the park. Wanna meet me? Maybe talk about it. I'm a pretty good listener. Dan?

  Dan
Yeah. Yeah, I'd, uh... I'd like that.

[Lily leaves the Palace with Bart and the wedding planner.]

  Lily
...Well I wanted cymbidiums, not hyacinth, and why did we choose fish? It's unseasonably warm. You know, I knew we should've gone with the Limoges instead of the Lenox...

  Bart
What's the matter? You were fine this morning. Now you're finding fault with everything.

  Lily
Nothing. Nothing at all. I'm just... I've had three perfect weddings, and I want this one to be more perfect than perfect, that's all.

[Lily's phone rings, from the Waldorf house.]

  Lily
Oh, finally. So why are you still at Blair's? You're supposed to be here.

  Dorota
Ms. van der Woodsen, it is Dorota. Miss Waldorf's...

  Lily
-- I know who you are, Dorota, but this is not a very good time.

  Dorota
Oh, the wedding, I know. Miss Serena is here.

  Lily
Oh yes, I know. I've heard several times today.

  Dorota
I know it's not my place, but... Miss Serena is... Like the old days.

  Lily
What are you trying to say?

  Dorota
I think you should have worry about your daughter. Worry like before she went away.

  Lily
Well, um... Thank you, Dorota. I'll take care of it.

[She hangs up.]

  Lily
I am so sorry, but I'm gonna have to go.

  Bart
Where do you have to go?

  Lily
To do something I've done too many times before.

  Bart
Can I help you?

  Lily
No. Thank you. I'll have to do it alone. Mwah.

[Lily searches S's room; she finds the USB drive and G's note.]

[S sits on the stairs at B's house.]

  Serena
...I can't believe I just did that.

  Nate
Then why did you? I mean, did you cheat on Dan?

  Serena
No. I remember last night. I didn't do anything.

  Blair
Then why would you say that to him?

  Serena
Because I would rather Dan think I cheated on him than know what I really did.

  Nate
What you really did?

  Serena
Dan puts me on a pedestal. If he knew the truth, he would never look at me again.

  Chuck
You're starting to scare even me. What did you do?

  Nate
Come on. You can tell us.

  Blair
We've seen you with vomit in your hair, making out with investment bankers in the men's room at PJ Clarke's. You don't have to hide anything from us.

  Nate
She's right, Serena. I mean, none of us are saints.

  Blair
Yeah, I had s*x with him in the back of a limo.

  Chuck
Several times.

  Nate
I had s*x with you at a wedding while I was her date. Once.

  Chuck
I'm Chuck Bass.

  Blair
You can tell us anything. We don't judge. We're the non-judging Breakfast Club. We're your best friends. Anything you do is something we did, too.

  Serena
If I tell you, it can never leave this room.


      ACT THREE

[Later, in B's sitting room.]

  Serena
You all know Georgina Sparks.

  Blair
Some of us better than others. (To Chuck) It's not like you didn't lose your virginity to her in seventh grade.

  Chuck
Sixth, actually, and I've been avoiding her ever since. The bitch is a psycho.

  Nate
What about her?

  Serena
Well, something happened the night of the Shepherd wedding.

  Blair
I think we're all aware of what happened that night.

  Serena
No, something else, something I've tried to escape, but Georgina won't let me. And now she's blackmailing me.

  Nate
Blackmailing you?

  Chuck
With what exactly?

  Serena
Well... It started when Blair thought you and I had too much to drink. She told us to go outside, get some air, sober up.

[Serena, dancing on the bar in a flashback: "Oh, if the happy couple didn't want to put up the cash for the premium bar, they should've made their wedding BYOB..."]

  Serena, over their hookup
Instead, we went into the empty bar, I opened the bottle of champagne, and we... Well...

  Blair, cutting into the flashback
We can skip that part, okay?

  Chuck
Go ahead. I'll fill her in later.

  Serena
I left in a hurry. I felt so terrible, so guilty for what I had just done. I just... I had to get out of there.

[Serena catches a cab in Nate's tuxedo shirt: "Eastview Hotel, please."]

  Serena
Georgina and I had plans to meet up after, so I headed straight to her. Little did I know she had a surprise waiting for me...

[Lily watches the tape on S's laptop.]

  Georgina, on the tape
"She's gonna lose her mind. A genuine Serena van der Woodsen s*x tape..."

  Pete
"How are we gonna do this, exactly?"

  Georgina
"Well, if you put the camera over there, she'll never know."

  Pete
"Are you sure she's gonna be down for this?"

  Georgina
"It's Serena, she goes down for anything."

[They make out, S enters.]

  Georgina
"Hey, baby. How are the new Mr. and Mrs. Shepherd?"

  Serena
I didn't know it at the time, but she was taping me. Lucky for me, I was... I was too stuck on what had just happened to be much fun for anyone.

  Serena, in video/flashback
"I can't believe I just did that. Blair's my best friend. What... What sort of person does that to her best friend?"

  Pete
"All right, this is a therapy session, G. You promised a party."

  Georgina
"So break out the favors!"

  Pete
"Jing!"

  Georgina
"Thank you."

  Serena, running to the bathroom
"Oh. I don't... I don't feel so good..."

  Georgina
"She always gets frisky after she hurls."

[Lily fast-forwards the tape. Pete is mauling Serena.]

  Serena
"No, Pete. I'm not in the mood, okay?"

  Pete
"Come on..."

  Serena
"I'm hot, okay? I'm... I'm too hot."

  Pete
"Oh, you are too hot."

  Serena
"No, it's... It's hot. Why is it so hot in here?"

[She tugs on the tuxedo shirt and he helps her off with it; she's wearing a camisole underneath. He kisses her neck, and she eventually kisses back. Lily slams the computer closed.]

  Blair
What is it?

  Serena
I can't.

  Blair
Yes. Yes, you can.

  Serena, crying
I'm scared.

  Blair
We're right here.

  Serena, in flashback
"No. You know, I can't. I can't. I can't do this, Pete. Okay? I can't. Um... Yeah, how about, um...how about we do a couple lines first, okay?"

  Pete
"Whatever, baby."

  Serena
"Here. Go ahead."

[Pete snorts a line, then starts moaning and convulsing.]

  Serena
"Pete? Pete, are you okay? Pete, what's happening? Are you okay? ...Georgie. Georgie! Georgina!"

  Georgina, entering
"What? Why are you screaming? What are you doing?"

  Serena
"I'm calling 911!"

  Georgina
"You -- You can't! There's drugs everywhere, we could get in so much trouble. We can get arrested. We have to go."

  Serena
"No! We can't leave him!"

  Georgina
"We have to. Get everything out that has you on it. Go."

  Serena
"Oh my God, oh my God. Oh, my God. Where's his phone? Where's his phone?"

  Georgina
"What are you doing?"

  Serena
"I'm calling!"
911: "Hello, 911 emergency."

  Serena
"Hi, uh, we have an emergency, can you send someone right away to the Eastview Hotel? Room, uh, 1411. Please. There's a guy, he's having seizures. I don't know what's wrong."

  Georgina
"Get off the phone! We have to go!"
911: "Ma'am, I'm gonna need your name and... Hello? Hello, ma'am? Are you there?

  Serena
So Georgina told me we had to split up. Then she said that people might be looking for us, but I... I couldn't go, I just couldn't. So I waited near the hotel, across the street. All I wanted was to see the paramedics helping Pete. But that's not what I saw.

[They carry Pete out on a gurney, in a body bag.]

  Serena
I didn't know what to do. I... I just knew I had to leave right away. I took a train heading north, and I got a room and convinced my mom that boarding school was a good idea, and...

  Blair
Never said good-bye. It makes sense now.

  Nate
But what does she even want from you?

  Serena
Well, when she came back, I... I told her that I moved on from the lifestyle that she was still in, but she didn't like that. So somehow, she became friends with Dan and ... and Vanessa and called herself "Sarah."

  Blair
Why don't you just tell Dan about her?

  Serena
Because she has that tape of me, and she'll use it. It's practically a snuff film.

  Chuck
We need to find her.

  Serena
No. Please. Promise me, please. Promise me you won't do anything. Because if you do, then she'll show Dan. ...If he even ever speaks to me again.

  Gossip Girl
"Watch out, S. Just because you finally tell the truth doesn't mean there won't be consequences."

  Serena
God, what have I done?


      ACT FOUR

[At the rehearsal dinner for Bart and Lily's wedding. Bart greets guests while Lily discusses things with the wedding planner.]

  Bart, kissing a guest
Sylvia. How are you?

  Sylvia
I'm wonderful.

  Bart
Good to see you again.

  Sylvia
So good to see you, too.

[S enters, with C and B.]

  Serena
Thanks for coming with me, B. I'm really not feeling up to being social.

  Blair
Of course.

  Lily, spotting her
Oh. Excuse me.

  Chuck
Incoming...

  Lily, taking her aside
You were supposed to be home hours ago. Come with me.

  Serena
I'm ... I'm sorry, Mom. And you look beautiful. I hope you don't mind I asked Blair to come tonight...

  Lily
What happened to you last night? Why didn't you come home? Why was Dan looking for you all morning? And why did I get a call informing me that you were on drugs?

  Serena
I wasn't on drugs...

  Lily
Don't lie to me. I saw that little home movie that you and your friends made.

  Serena
You... You watched that?

  Lily
Well, only part of it. I stopped when that guy had his tongue down your throat. But I can pretty much guess how it ends.

  Serena
No, it... It was just a joke! We were kidding, it's not what it looked like...

  Lily
You know what? You are out of control. I always knew you had a wild side, but how can you look at yourself? What have you become? I thought we were past all of this, Serena. I thought you were doing so well. I have nothing left but to send you to reformatory school. What do you think about that?

  Blair, as Lily storms off
What's wrong? What happened?

[S cries on her shoulder.]

[Vanessa gets everything ready for Rufus's show in Queens while he chats with Lisa Loeb.]

  Vanessa, handing him a guitar
Hey, guys. Sorry to interrupt. Tuned to F#m, and Lisa, Sheckman told me to tell you you're almost up.

  Lisa Loeb
Okay. Thanks.

  Rufus
Thanks, Vanessa.

  Dan, entering
Hey.

  Rufus
Hey!

  Dan
This is incredible, Dad! I hope you're sufficiently nervous, because there's like a hundred people out there. Which is 80 more than the last time you played, I think...

  Rufus
Lisa, this is my sarcastic son Dan and his friend Sarah.

  Lisa Loeb
Hey. Nice to meet you.

  Dan
Pleasure.

  Georgina
Nice to meet you.

  Lisa Loeb,bouncing
I'll see y'all later.

  Rufus
Okay. (Turning to Dan) Yeah. Ah, no Serena?

  Georgina
I'll take good care of him, Mr. Humphrey. Promise.

  Dan
Jenny's already called me about fifteen times from Mom's to make sure that I call her during "Something Like That" so she can hear you mess up the bridge. So break a leg. I'll be in the front row.

  Rufus
Okay, okay.

[Random girl in the audience spots G, scaring her.]

  Girl
Hey, Georgina! Georgina...

  Dan
Uh, I think she thinks she knows you.

  Georgina
I've never seen her before in my life. Um, let's go get a drink.

[B interrupts Lily's conversation at the rehearsal dinner.]

  Blair
-- Don't send her away.

  Lily
Blair, it's... It's, uh, not polite to interrupt.

  Blair
I don't care who hears. Just don't send her away.

  Lily, taking her aside
Excuse me. Thank you, Blair, but it's not exactly your business what I do with my daughter. If anything, you're one of the reasons I'm having to take such strong actions.

  Blair
I say this with all due respect, Lily, but you have no idea what your daughter's been going through. She's in a lot of pain, and I don't think the pain's gonna go away if she goes away.

  Lily
I don't understand what you're trying to tell me.

  Blair
Serena has a secret, and she's been holding on to it for a long, long time. And now it's finally catching up with her. I... I'm out of my league here. I can't do any more than I've done, and it's not enough. She needs you.

  Lily
I saw the video. She doesn't need me. She needs boundaries.

  Blair
What you saw isn't the whole story.

[N calls V at the show.]

  Nate
Hey V, it's me.

  Vanessa
You're not calling to cancel, are you? Because waiting twenty minutes before the concert maybe isn't the best way to let a girl down.

  Nate
No, I'm calling to let you know I may be ten minutes late because -- drumroll, please -- I'm actually gonna take the subway to the show.

  Vanessa
Subway, huh? Nate Archibald, man of the people!

  Nate
Oh, well, thank you.

  Vanessa
Uh, and your name's on the list, but if you don't see me, just look for Dan and our friend Sarah. They'll know where I am.

  Nate
Wait, Sarah's there? With Dan?

  Vanessa
As strange as it may seem, Dan is here. It is his dad's gig.

  Nate
No, no, no. I'm not talking about Dan. I'm talking about Sarah.

  Vanessa
Okay, now you're totally weirding me out.

  Nate
Sarah is not her real name. It's Georgina. Serena just told us this really messed up story about her. Just do not trust anything she says, please.

  Vanessa
Wh... What are you talking about?

  Nate
Listen, I'll tell you what I can when I get there, okay?

  Vanessa
Okay?

  Nate
Okay. I'll see you soon.

[Chuck discreetly hands Lily a slip of paper.]

  Chuck
Excuse me. Here's the address you asked for.

  Lily
Thank you, Charles. Um, excuse us...

  Blair, answering her phone
Hello?

  Nate
Hey, I only have a second. I'm on my way to Queens.

  Blair
Ugh. Gross. Why?

  Nate
To meet Vanessa at a concert.

  Blair
It got grosser.

  Nate
We've been hanging out. Not that I owe you any explanation, but I do feel like I should tell you Apparently, Georgina's with her and Dan.

  Blair
She -- She's there?

  Nate
Yeah. And you know Serena doesn't want us to do anything, but I just thought you might want to know.

  Blair
Where are you right now?

  Nate
Uh ... 74th and Lex.

  Blair
Don't move. Pick you up in ten.

  Lily
I have to go handle this thing with Serena.

  Bart
Now?

  Lily
Yes, now.

  Bart
It's our rehearsal dinner. And you're the bride.

  Lily
I know, but I'm also a mother, and ... that's more important.

  Blair
So your problems are my problems, let me come and help.

  Lily
I can't. I, uh... I wish I could explain.

  Blair
There seems to be a lot lately that you can't explain.

  Lily, kissing his cheek
I'm sorry. But this is between me and my daughter.

[As Lily leaves, C notices B grinning evilly.]

  Chuck
What's gotten into you?

  Blair
What if I told you I knew where Georgina Sparks was right now?

  Chuck
I'd say let's get the bitch.

  Gossip Girl
"Spotted: Blair and Chuck, reunited to defend Serena's honor. With friends like these, who needs armies?"


      ACT FIVE

[Lily and S pull up outside a strange house.]

  Serena
So where are we?

  Lily
It's the Fairman's house. This is where the boy who died grew up, and his parents are expecting you.

  Serena
Mom, I can't go in there.

  Lily
Sweetie... If I've learned anything in life, it is that sometimes things get in your path, and you have a choice. You can either smash right into them, or you can adjust and move around, but you have to do one or the other in order to move forward.

  Serena
How can I do this?

  Lily
I'm gonna be right by your side.

[G runs into V as Lisa Loeb takes the stage.]

  MC
Ladies and gentlemen, how about a round of applause for Lisa Loeb?

  Lisa Loeb
Hey, everyone. How you doing? I'm Lisa Loeb, and I'm your host for tonight, and I am so happy you're all here. Thanks so much for coming.

  Georgina
Hey, V. I didn't realize you'd be able to hang during the concert.

  Vanessa
Do you have something you want to say to me?

  Georgina
Not that I know of...

  Vanessa
You sure about that, Georgina? My friend says Serena told him some story about you, and he's on his way to fill me in. Unless you want to do that first?

  Georgina
I don't know what you're talking about.

  Vanessa
I'm not a big fan of liars, and neither is Dan. I'm giving you a chance to explain yourself here.

  Dan, as G stomps off:
Where's Sarah going?

  Vanessa
I don't know who she is. Nate just called me and said her name is Georgina.

  Dan
That's what that girl... That's what that girl back there called her. Why would she lie about her name?

  Vanessa
I think there's some other stuff, too...

  Roadie
Vanessa, Rufus can't find the set list. Do you know where it is?

  Vanessa
I taped it into the top of his Gibson case, uh... I'll get it. This will just take two minutes, just don't go anywhere. Stay right here. I'll be right back.

[Dan immediately wanders away.]

[Lily and S leave the Fairman house.]

  Lily
You okay?

  Serena
No. No, I feel terrible, Mom.

  Lily
Oh, you heard what they said. Look, Peter was an addict for ten years. His own parents couldn't get him to stop using, there's no way that a sixteen-year-old girl could have. They don't hold you responsible. You don't need to blame yourself...

  Serena
-- But I am responsible, Mom. I'm the one that gave him the line that killed him.

  Lily
Serena, those were his drugs, okay? If you hadn't given them to him, he would have taken them himself.

  Serena
Then why do I still feel like this?

  Lily
Because contrary to what I might have said earlier, you are a good person who, since that night, has been living your life with care and compassion and respect for yourself and for others. I'm sorry I doubted you.

  Serena, hugging her
Thank you. There's something else i have to do. Will you help me?

  Lily
Absolutely.

  Serena
Take me to see Dan.

[Lisa Loeb sings "Stay" while G lies some more.]

  Dan
Okay, so your name is really Georgina. Well, I don't understand why you felt like you had to lie to us.

  Georgina
Because... My boyfriend -- well, my ex-boyfriend -- when we broke up, he wasn't too happy about it, and things got out of control.

  Dan
Okay, well, what happened?

  Georgina
I came home one day, and... My car was broken into, and then a week later, my room was trashed, and I got really scared. I changed all my numbers, I moved in with a friend, and yet he still tracked me down. It was my Mom's idea to change my name and move out of town. I hate being away from my family, but... It's better than getting hurt, right?

  Dan
Yeah, right.

  Georgina
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I just... I wasn't supposed to tell anybody.

  Dan
No, no, no. No. No. I get that. I get it.

  Georgina
And I also didn't want you to think less of me, because I haven't wanted to admit it, but, um... From the moment that I met you, I've been falling for you. Oh my God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't... I don't know what I'm saying...

  Dan, over the cheers for Lisa Loeb
You know, um, you know, it's really loud here. Do you wanna go somewhere else, someplace quiet we can talk?

  Georgina
But your Dad's about to go on...

  Dan, leading her away
He'll understand. It's not like we won't be watching this on YouTube for the next five years.


      ACT SIX

[Rufus sings a catchy song whose lyrics are one line -- "Everytime you walk away or run away you take a piece of me with you there" -- over and over, approximately a million times. N, C and Queen B enter the show.]

  Vanessa, spotting Nate
Hmm. Some date we've got here. You even brought your friends... The ones I can't stand.

  Blair
Where's Georgina?

  Nate
What are you gonna do? You heard what Serena said.

  Chuck
Yeah, like we care.

  Vanessa
Georgina left.

  Blair
Left for where?

  Vanessa
I don't know, she just took off. If I could only find Dan... He's around here somewhere...

  Nate
Well, let's go look for him. Alone.

[They leave; S enters and she and B spot each other.]

  Blair
Hey, what are you doing here?

  Serena
Hey, what are you doing here?

  Blair
I... I'm a big Leaky Hawk fan?

  Serena
...I'm looking for Dan and Georgina.

  Chuck
You're out of luck. Georgina's gone.

  Serena
And Dan?

  Chuck
I'm out of luck. He's still around.

  Serena, smiling and holding B's hands
It's all over now. I can finally tell Dan everything. Will you help me find him?

[They leave Chuck alone; Lily dials Bart but hangs up when she hears Rufus singing that song over and over. She watches him sing and he smiles at her. She leaves while he's still playing, and he ends the song.]

  Lisa Loeb
All right. Everybody, that was Lincoln Hawk. Let's hear it! Let's hear an encore from Rufus and the band. The...

  Rufus, pushing past her and running away
Excuse me...

[Outside, he stands between Lily and her car.]

  Lily
Get out of my way, Rufus.

  Rufus
No.

  Lily
Get out of my way.

  Rufus
No.

[Lily finally kisses him.]

[B and C are following S into the stands when B's phone rings: HUMPHREY CALLING.]

  Blair, passing her the phone
Hey, psst. I think it's for you.

  Serena
Hey! Thank God you called, I'm here looking for you right now. Where are you?

  Georgina
With me.

  Serena
Georgina?

  Georgina
I hear you told our little secret. If that's the way you wanna play it, that's how we'll play it.

  Serena
No, I'm not afraid of you anymore.

  Georgina
Oh? You should be. 'Cause all bets are off.

  Serena
Why? What are you gonna do?

  Georgina
It's not what I'm gonna do, sweetie. It's who I'm gonna do it with...

  Serena
No. I know Dan. He's too good.

  Georgina, hanging up
You sure about that?

  Dan, with coffee
How did everything go with your Mom?

  Georgina, tossing his phone's battery
Good. Yeah. She was glad I finally found someone I could trust. Um... Are you sure that you don't mind missing the after party to have coffee with me?

  Dan
You know what? After the day I've had, there's no place I'd rather be.

[She kisses him, and he kisses her back, while at the show, Serena stares into space.]

  Gossip Girl
"If I were you, S, I'd be worried. In the city that never sleeps, a lot can happen in one night..."

[Dan leads her away.]

  Gossip Girl
"Sweet dreams, Serena. XOXO, Gossip Girl."

      END OF EPISODE




[INT GRAND CENTRAL STATION, Serena walks in, a girl watches her and takes a photo with her cell phone]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Hey Upper East Siders, Gossip Girl here... and I have the biggest news ever. One of my many sources, Melanie91, sends us this: Spotted at Grand Central, bags in hand: Serena van der Woodsen. Was it only a year ago our It-Girl mysteriously disappeared for quote 'boarding school'? And just as suddenly she's back. Don't believe me? See for yourselves: Lucky for us, Melanie91 sent proof. Thanks for the photo, Mel!

[Rufus takes a look around the station and finds his son and daughter, he walks up and hugs them]

  Rufus
Dan, Jenny! Over here!

  Jenny
Hey, dad!

  Rufus
Hey, hey! You made it. Welcome back! How was your weekend? How was your mom?

  Dan
She's fine.

  Jenny
Good... fine, I guess.

  Dan
She's good and fine.

  Rufus
Like 'Maybe I should never have left Manhatten' fine or 'Taking a time-out from my marriage was the best idea I've ever had' fine?

  Dan
Dad, you know... I'm starving.

  Rufus
Let's go home. I'm cooking. Caprese salad with a little mozzarella di Bufala... yeah, I'm gonna make you guys...

[Rufus puts an arms around Jenny and they walk off, Dan turns around and notices Serena]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)

  Spotted
Lonely Boy... can't believe the love of his life has returned. If only she knew who he was. But everyone knows Serena. And everyone is talking.

[EXT NEW YORK - Several people are standing in the streets, looking at the newest 'Gossip Girl' entry on their cell phones]

  Gossip Girl
Wonder what Blair Waldorf thinks. Sure, they're BFFs but we always thought Blair's boyfriend Nate had a thing for Serena.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - BATHROOM - Blair takes a look at a new text message: 'Serena is Back!', she leaves the bathroom and rejoins a party, her mother, Eleanor, is talking to a friend]

  Eleanor
...I have to design a dress for this woman.

[Eleanor turns to Blair]

  Eleanor
Blair, if you're gonna to wear one of my designs tell me about it so we can at least get it properly fitted.

  Blair
Thanks, mom. Keep that in mind. Great party.

[Eleanor turns back to her friend]

  Eleanor
She is my best advertisement.

[Nate, his father, Howie, and another guest are standing together]

  Party Guest
So, Nate, started thinking about college?

  Howie
Well, actually I'm a Dartmouth man.

  Nate
Yes, dad's always spoken very highly of Dartmouth. But I would like to check out west. You know, maybe USC, UCLA?

  Howie
His mother wouldn't hear of it. Dartmouth is far enough away for her.

  Nate
Yes, well... Dartmouth is my first choice.

[Blair walks up to her boyfriend, Nate, and his father, also called 'The Captain']

  Blair
Excuse me, captain. Nate, can I borrow you?

  Nate
Eh, sure. Excuse me for a second.

[Chuck, a friend of Nate's is sitting on the couch with Isabel and Katy]

  Chuck
Nathaniel, any interest in some fresh air?

[Chuck signals Nate that he wants to smoke a joint with him]

  Nate
When I get back?

  Blair
If he gets back!

[Blair leads Nate into her bedroom and pushes him onto the bed]

  Nate
What's going on?

  Blair
I wanna do this... It... Now.

  Nate
Now now? You wanted to wait...

  Blair
Not anymore.

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Better lock it down with Nate, B. Clock's ticking.

[Chuck plays with his drink, looking bored, Isabel and Katy are reading their text mesages]

  Katy
My god, you'll never believe what's on 'Gossip Girl'.

  Isabel
Someone saw Serena get off a train at Grand Central.

  Chuck
Good, things were getting a little... dull around here.

[EXT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - The doorman opens the door of a town car, Serena gets out]

  Serena
Thank you.

[INT BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Blair and Nate are kissing on the bed, undressed]

  Blair
I love you. Nate Archiblaid. Always have, always will.

  Nate
I love you too.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Serena walks in and gets noticed by Eleanor]

  Eleanor
Serena van der Woodsen? Is that you?

[Eleanor knocks on the door]

  Eleanor
Blair, it's Serena!

  Nate
Serena?

  Blair
Serena is at school. Kiss me.

  Nate
No, I think I heard your mom say she's here. Don't you wanna go say hey?

[Nate gets of the bed and starts getting dressed]

  Blair
Yeah... totally.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Serena is walking through the party guest who start talking behind her back]

  Party Guests
...I heard she is pregnant... rehab... she looks good...

[Serena walks up to her mother, Lily, who is talking to a friend]

  Lily

  So I told him
Forget it, I don't care if it's mahogany. It clashes with my sofa.

  Serena
Mom... mom! Hey.

  Lily
Oh, Serena, darling.

[They hug each other]

  Serena
So, were is he? What, they haven't let him out yet?

  Lily
Let's not discuss this right now, ok? I thought you might want to see some of your friends.

  Serena
Thanks.

[Serena notices Nate on the other side of the room, Blair opens her bedroom door and walks into the room, blocking Nate from Serena's view, Serena and Blair hug]

  Blair
Hi, Serena, so good to see you.

  Serena
Good to see you.

  Blair
Come, we're about to have dinner.

  Eleanor
I'll set a place for you at the table next to Blair.

  Serena
Yeah, actually... there's somewhere I have to go.

  Blair
You're leaving?

  Serena
Yeah, I just... I don't feel well. I just wanted to come by and say hi. I'll see you at school tomorrow.

[Serena leaves the party]

  Blair
School... so I guess she's back for good.

  Katy
Didn't you know she was coming?

  Blair
Course I did. I just... wanted it to be a surprise.

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Word is that S bailed on B's party in under 90 seconds and didn't even have one lemon shot. Has our bad girl really gone good? Or is it all just part of the act?

[INT OSTROFF CENTER - Serena walks in, passes the nurse's station and looks into a patient's room]

  Nurse
Young lady, you can't be here. Visting hours are over.

  Serena
I'm family. He's my brother.

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPREYS - DAN'S BEDROOM - Dan is looking at the blog of 'Gossip Girl']

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Why'd she leave? Why'd she return? Send me all the deepth. And who am I? That's one secret I'll never tell. The only one. XOXO Gossip Girl.

      END OF TEASER

[INT OSTROFF CENTER - ERIK'S ROOM - Serena's brother, Erik, finds Serena sleeping on a chair next to his bed and wakes her up]

  Erik
Serena... Serena, hey.

  Serena
Hey, how are you?

  Erik
You know, I've been better.

  Serena
Erik, I know I've been a terrible sister. I'm so happy to see you.

  Erik
Must be a lot of rumour why you're back.

  Serena
Yeah, but none of them mentioned you.

  Erik
Just like mom wants, hm?

[Lily enters]

  Lily
What do I want, baby? For Serena sleeping in her own bed, possibly wearing pyjamas.

  Serena
Morning, mom. Hey, I was just about to ask the doctor if I could take Erik to breakfast. Wanna come?

  Lily
Ehm, I think what I'll do is to get him a croissant down the street.

[Lily leaves the room, Serena storms after her]

  Erik
Serena, don't!

  Serena

  Let me guess
You told everyone Erik is just visiting grandpa in Rhode Island.

  Lily
Your aunt Carol in Miami.

  Serena
So, you're actually hiding him. He tries to take his own life and you're worried it will cost you 'Mom Of The Year'?

  Lily
Serena, you've been gone. Doing who knows what with god knows who...

  Serena
I told you, boarding school was not like that.

  Lily
As happy as I am to have you home, you have no idea what it's been like.

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - KITCHEN - Jenny organizes handwritten invitations, Rufus is making breakfast, Dan walks in]

  Rufus
Guess who's dad is cool!

  Jenny
It's a trick question.

  Dan
Yeah, 'cause it can't be ours.

  Rufus
Look at this!

[Rufus hands Dan an issue of 'Rolling Stone', Dan reads the front page]

  Dan
'Top 10 Forgotten Bands Of The '90s'.

  Rufus
Yeah, check out who's number nine.

  Jenny
He is very proud.

  Dan
Hey, hey way to be forgotten!

  Rufus
But that's how you get remembered.

  Jenny
Maybe you'd care if dad's band was on 'Gossip Girl'.

  Dan
What? I don't read 'Gossip Girl'. That's... that's for chicks.

  Jenny
So that wasn't your laptop you've been to last night to read all about Serena van der Woodsen.

[Dan takes the magazine from Rufus]

  Dan
Holy stone, wow! Let me take a look at this again, dad. Very cool, looking hot, number nine!

  Rufus
Hey, what are you working on?

  Jenny
It's called the 'Kiss On The Lips' party. Everyone's going.

  Dan
You're invited to that?

[Jenny stares at Dan]

  Dan
Well, no offense if I sound surprised... since I've never been invited.

  Jenny
One of the girls in my art class saw my calligraphy and she said that if I addressed all the invitations that I got one.

  Rufus
Sounds very fair. Sweatshops could learn a thing or two.

  Jenny
Dad, this is not a platform for me to end capitalization. That's why you make us go to private schools.

  Rufus
That's for your education.

  Jenny
So we should be anonymous losers who eat lunch alone and never get invited to parties?

  Dan
Works for me.

  Jenny
Mom thinks it's a good idea.

  Rufus
And her judgment is always sound, right? Jenny, if you wanna go to that party you should go. You kids could use some fun.

[EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Serena walks up to the front entrance, Nate is already waiting for her]

  Serena
Nate?

  Nate
Oh, hey! Uhm, your mom told me you guys are staying here at The Palace.

  Serena
Yeah, we're renovating... again. You know my mom: If it's not broke, break it. So what are you doing here?

  Nate
Oh, I just wanted to see how you were. You seemed kind of upset last night.

  Serena
I got to get going and change for school. I'm gonna be late.

  Nate
Serena...

  Serena
No, no.

  Nate
But you're back now.

  Serena
I didn't come back for you. Look, Blair's my best friend and you're her boyfriend and she loves you. That's the way things are supposed to be.

[EXT NEW YORK CITY - Dan runs across the street to catch his bus to school]

  Taxi Driver
Hey, watch were you're going!

[INT BUS - Chuck and Nate are sitting next to each other, Dan is standing in the alley]

  Chuck
Serena looked effing hot last night. There's something wrong with that level of perfection... it needs to be violated.

  Nate
You are deeply disturbed.

  Chuck
And yet you know I'm right. You're telling me if you had the chance...

  Nate
I have a girlfriend.

  Chuck
You guys have been dating since kindergarden and you haven't sealed the deal.

  Nate
Who says 'seal the seal'?

[Chuck signals Nate that they have arrived at school]

  Chuck
Come on.

[They get up, Dan is standing behind them, Chuck turns to Dan]

  Chuck
You following us or something?

  Dan
No, I... I go to your school. Identical uniforms, that's kind of a tip-off?

  Nate
That's funny.

[Chuck and Nate leave the bus, Dan talks to himself]

  Dan
So you guys wanna sit together at lunch?

[EXT MET - Blair, Isabel and Katy are sitting on the steps looking at the invitations, Jenny is standing next to them]

  Isabel
So cute! They should be framed or something.

  Blair
Not bad work. And here is yours... as promised.

[Blair hands Jenny one of the invitations]

  Jenny
Thanks.

[Serena walks up to them, eating a yoghurt]

  Serena
Hey, here you guys are. I looked all over the dining hall for you.

[Serena notices Jenny and shakes her hand]

  Serena
Oh, hi, I'm Serena.

  Jenny
I know, uhm, I mean, hi, I'm Jenny.

[Serena picks up one of the invitations]

  Serena
So, when's the party?

  Blair
Saturday. And you're kinda not invited. Since until 12 hours ago everyone thought you were at boarding school. And Jenny used up all the invites.

  Jenny
Uhm, actually...

  Blair
You can go now.

[Jenny leaves]

  Blair
Sorry.

  Serena
No, it's ok. I've got a lot of stuff to do anyway.

[Serena throws the invitation onto the steps]

  Blair
Well, we should get going then. Unless you want us to wait for you. Looks like you got a lot of yoghurt left.

  Serena
No, go ahead.

[Blair, Isabel and Katy walk away, Serena turns around]

  Serena
Blair, think we can meet tonight?

  Blair
I'd love to but I'm doing something with Nate tonight.

  Serena
The Palace, 8 o'clock. Nate will wait.

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)

  Spotted
At the steps of the Met, an S and B power struggle.

  Blair
I can probably do a half hour.

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Did S think she could waltz home and things would be just like they were?

  Serena
Thanks for making the time.

  Blair
Your my best friend.

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Did B think S would go down without a fight? Or can these two hotties work it out? There's nothing 'Gossip Girl' likes more than a good catfight. And this could be a classic.

[EXT NEW YORK CITY - Rufus is putting up flyers for a concert of his band 'Lincon Hawk', Dan is with him]

  Dan
Uh, you know... you know, dad, there's this thing called 'myspace' where you post all this information online. Save some trees, have a blog.

  Rufus
Maybe if musicians would get off their blogs and picked up their guitars then music business would be in better shape.

  Dan
Ok, like a true relic.

  Rufus
Thanks, son.

[Dan's cell phone rings, he takes a look at the new text message: Jenny (Mobile), Sep 24, 2007, 3:15:23 PM, HELP: EMERGENCY. 712 5TH AVE.]

  Dan
Hey dad, listen, uhm, I got to run. You'll be ok?

  Rufus
Yeah. You'll mom will be back. She's always been a free spirit. That's one of the reasons I fell for her in the first place.

  Dan
I meant with the flyers.

  Rufus
Luckily, staple guns are old-school. Go, I'm gonna be fine.

[INT OSTROFF CENTER - ERIK'S ROOM - Serena walks in]

  Serena
I talked to the nurse and I'm kidnapping you.

  Erik
We're going shopping, aren't we.

  Serena
We're going to Wendells... just for an hour though, I swear. I had a really bad day.

  Erik
Really? 'Cause I had a great day: A couple of pills, bunch of Rorschach tests... they had this green jelly for lunch.

  Serena
Mmh, yummy! Why didn't you save me any? Come on, we need to get you out of here before mom shows up.

[INT WENDELLS - DEPARTMENT STORE - Dan walks up to Jenny who's trying on a red dress]

  Dan
Jenny, what is it? What is wrong?

  Jenny
Do you like this on me?

  Dan
Wait... wait a second, is that why you needed me? I thought this was an emergency.

  Jenny
A fashion emergency. I mean, come on, I've never been to a big dance before.

  Dan
Neither have I.

  Jenny
Yeah, but mom's gone and dad's allergic to department stores.

  Dan
Well, you look good, Jen. You do, really.

  Jenny
Thanks. I'm mean, too bad it's more than our rent but I think I can sew something like it.

[Jenny notices Serena and Erik walking towards them]

  Jenny
Oh my gosh, it's Serena. Hi, Serena!

[Jenny takes an invitation adressed to 'Serena van der Woodsen' out of her bag, Dan panics and vanishes]

  Serena
Hey. Hey, Jenny, right?

  Jenny
Yeah.

  Serena
This is my...

  Erik
Stylist and personal shopper. Erik, hi.

  Jenny
Hi, uhm, this is my brother... or...

[Jenny gestures behind her, notices Dan is gone, Dan is hiding behind a rack of dresses, watching Serena]

  Serena
So is this your dress for the 'Kiss On The Lips' party?

  Jenny
Sort of. Speaking of that.

[Jenny gives Serena the invitation]

  Jenny
Here, I made you one during free period but anyone asks where you got it, I know nothing.

  Serena
Thanks.

[Serena and Erik walk away]

  Jenny
Dan, Dan?

[Serena turns around]

  Serena
Jenny, that dress would look even better in black.

  Jenny
Black. Cool. Thanks.

[EXT NEW YORK - PARK - Chuck and Nate are taking a walk, smoking a Joint]

  Chuck
This is some good stuff.

  Nate
Yeah, I'm gonna need it. Blair's mom's at the country house.

  Chuck
Yeah? Then maybe I should swipe some of my dad's viagra? Or my mom's paxils? Nathaniel, you're finally about to have s*x with your girlfiend. It's like you're heading to your execution.

  Nate
No, man. I'm good.

  Chuck
Talk to Chuck, buddy. You and Blair have been dating forever, all of a sudden there is a problem?

  Nate
There is no problem. It's just... do you ever feel like our whole lives have been planned out for us? That we're just gonna... end up like our parents?

  Chuck
Man, that's a dark thought.

  Nate
You know, aren't we entitled to choose... just to be happy?

  Chuck
Look, easy, Sokrates. What we're entitled to is a trust fund... maybe a house in the Hamptons, a prescription drug problem. Happiness does not seem to be on the menue. So smoke up and seal the deal with Blair... 'cause you're also entitled to tab that ass.

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BAR - Serena and Blair are sitting at the bar, Blair is drinking a Martini]

  Serena
So, how's your mom doing... with the divorce and everything?

  Blair
Great. So my dad left her for another man. She's lost 15 pounds, got an eye-lift. It's been good for her.

  Serena
I'm really sorry.

  Blair
Yeah, I could tell since you didn't call or write the entire time it was happening.

  Serena
No, I know... I was just... boarding school... it's like...

  Blair
I don't even know why you went to boarding school to begin with. Do you know how it felt, calling your house when you didn't show up at school and having your mom say: Serena didn't tell you that she moved to Connetticut?

  Serena
I just... I had to go. I needed to get away from everything. Please just trust me.

  Blair
How can I trust you when I feel like I don't even know you.

  Serena
Let's fix that. I saw you at school with Katy and Is and I get it. I don't want to take any of that away from you. I just...

  Blair
Because it's just yours to take if you want it?

  Serena
No, that's not what I mean. I... I miss you. I just want things to go back to the way they used to be. You know, walking to school togheter, dancing on tables at Bungalow, the nights when we were at your mom's country house. You were like my sister... and with our families... we need each other.

  Blair
Well, you missed some classic Eleanor Waldorf melt-downs. If it wasn't such a tragedy it would have been funny. Actually kinda was.

  Serena
Well, I wish I could have been there.

  Blair
You are now. I have to meet Nate. I kind of have something special and...

  Serena
Well, I don't want to keep you but...

[Serena hugs Blair]

  Serena
I love you, B.

  Blair
I love you too, S.

[Blair leaves]

At The Palace Hotel, S and B having a heart to heart.

[Serena takes Blair's left over Martini and emptys it in one gulp]

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - JENNY'S ROOM - Jenny is sitting at the sewing machine, Dan enters]

  Dan
Hey!

  Jenny
Ah, the invisible man returns. You know, I really had no idea you could move that fast.

  Dan
Yeah, well, your fashion emergency was solved, so... I figured my work was done.

  Jenny
Come on, Dan. Serena said hi to you at her 9th grade birthday party and you've never forgotten it.

  Dan
How could I? She was the only person who spoke to me. And I'm pretty sure she thought I was someone else.

  Jenny
Well, you know, she is actually nice. And if she did know you I think she would really like you.

  Dan
I don't know, I think she would be a tad overwhelmed by the glitz and the glamour of the Humphrey lifestyle.

  Jenny
Well, I heard she's living at The Palace Hotel.

  Dan
Well, my point exactly.

  Jenny
Probably sitting at the bar by herself, sipping Martinis... all alone. You know, it's actually kinda sad. Oh, and dad's at the gallery working late. He left money for dinner, so I was thinking Indian.

  Dan
You know... you know what, I think I'm... I'm gonna go out.

[Dan leaves]

  Jenny
Ok... good, 'cause I already ordered and only got enough for one.

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BAR - Chuck enters, shoves some women aside]

  Chuck
Hello, please.

[Chuck walks over to Serena who is having another Martini]

  Chuck
I love this town. I'm going to have to tell my parents the hotel they just bought is serving minors.

  Serena
And if you get a drink they are also serving pigs.

  Chuck
I love it when you talk dirty.

  Serena
You just love when a girl talks to you.

  Chuck
Actually, I prefer them when they're not talking.

  Serena
Oh, I've missed your witty banter.

  Chuck
Let's catch up. Take our clothes off, stare at each other.

  Serena
What about I just get a bit to eat. I've been drinking on an empty stomach.

  Chuck
I heard you didn't do that anymore.

  Serena
Special occasion.

  Chuck
Well, what about a grilled cheese with truffel oil? You do love truffels?

  Serena
Enough to know it's not on the menue.

  Chuck
But then I'm connected.

  Serena
Only because I'm hungry.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - BLAIR'S BEDROOM - The room is lit by candles, Nate enters, Blair is waiting for him in lingerie]

  Nate
Wow.

  Blair
Hi.

  Nate
Hi.

  Blair
Is it too much? I wanted it to be special.

[Blair kisses Nate but he pulls away]

  Blair
What's wrong?

  Nate
Look, I don't know how to say this... or if it's even the right thing to do but ehm... there's something I need to tell you.

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - KITCHEN - Chuck puts a bundle of Dollar bills into the jacket of the chef, Alfonso and his staff leave]

  Chuck
Alfonso, you're stud. Now have good night, we're closing the kitchen early.

  Serena
Oh my god, this is so good.

  Chuck
Well, if you're looking for a way to thank me I've got a couple ideas.

  Serena
It's a sandwich, Chuck.

[Chuck touches Serena's thigh and leans in on her]

  Serena
This is... this is not happening right now.

  Chuck
You're worried Nate will find out?

  Serena
What?

  Chuck
Last year... the Sheperd wedding... think I don't know why you left town?

[FLASHBACK - ONE YEAR AGO - INT BAR - Serena is dancing on the bar, holding a bottle of champagne, Nate tries to stop her]

  Nate
Serena, you are not supposed to be here.

  Serena
Oh well, if the happy couple didn't want to put up a catch for the bar they should let me be where I want to be. Move!

  Nate
Let me see it!

  Serena
No, make me!

  Nate
I can do it, I can open it. Let me show you... here, come here. Let me see...

  Serena
No!

  Nate
Let me... stop?

[They both pull on the bottle until it opens with a loud bang]

  Serena
Nate!

  Nate
That never happens to me.

  Serena
It's ok. You're stronger than me, alright.

  Nate
Come here.

  Serena
Look at you, you're a mess.

  Nate
So are you.

[Serena and Nate are about to kiss]

[INT BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Nate turns his face away from Blair]

  Blair
But... that was it... you guys kissed.

[Nate shakes his head]

[FLASHBACK - ONE YEAR AGO - INT BAR - Serena and Nate make out heavily, undressing each other, Chuck watches from the balcony]

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - KITCHEN]

  Chuck
Best friend and the boyfriend. That's pretty classy, S. I think you're more like me than you admit.

  Serena
No, no, that... that was then. I'm trying to change.

  Chuck
I liked you better before.

[Chuck tries to kiss Serena, she pushes him away]

Stop it. Stop! No! Stop it!

I'm... so sorry, Are you ok?

[Serena takes her purse and runs off, Dan finds her cell phone on the floor and tries to tell Serena but she is already gone]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
And just when B and S had built a bridge... it all had to come crashing down. But dry your eyes: the 'Kiss On The Lips' party is around the corner. And you know who loves parties? Gossip Girl.

[EXT - NEW YORK - PARK - Nate and his father are having a race, Howie wins]

  Howie
Nice try, son.

  Nate
Maybe next time.

  Howie
You seem upbeat this morning. Did you have fun with Blair last night?

  Nate
Actually, we got into a pretty big fight.

  Howie
You want my advice? Apologise. Even if it was her fault. Flowers, maybe some jewellery if she's really upset. Always works for your mother.

  Nate
I don't know. I think it may be for the best.

  Howie
Wait a minute, you guys broke up?

  Nate
Yeah, I guess we did.

  Howie
Blair is a great girl.

  Nate
I know. But I'm just not sure if she's the girl for me.

  Howie
But you guys have been dating since kindergarden.

  Nate
So I keep hearing.

  Howie
I mean, you love her, don't you?

  Nate
Yes, I do. I just think it might be good for us to take a break, you know.

  Howie
Maybe not right now. Eleanor Waldorf is gearing up to take her company public and I've been cording her for month to let me handle the deal.

  Nate
Then you should get it.

  Howie
I will get it... if you just help me out a little bit.

[Nate looks at his father in disbelief]

  Howie
What? You love her, she loves you. It's just a rough patch, that's all. You don't give up just because things are hard. Not in business or if your family is depending on you.

[INT - THE PALACE HOTEL - Dan is standing at the reception talking to the Concierge who is holding Serena's cell phone]

  Concierge
How did you know it was Miss van der Woodsen if you didn't read it and if you are not a guest at the hotel what were you doing there?

  Dan
What? Uhm, look, when Prince Charming found Cinderella's slipper they didn't accuse him of having a foot-fetish.

  Concierge
And you are Prince Charming? Well, there is Miss van der Woodsen now...

  Dan
No, no, no, no...

  Concierge
Serena!

[Serena turns around and walks over to the reception]

  Dan
Don't, don't...

  Concierge
Do you know this young man?

  Dan
She doesn't know me. Nobody knows me. It's cool, it's fine.

  Serena
Uhm, from last night, right? I'm sorry about that.

  Dan
You remember me?

[Dan turns back to the Concierge]

  Dan
She remembers me.

  Concierge
Well, he claims he found your cell phone.

  Serena
Oh, you found it.

[Lily walks over, carrying a cloth bag]

  Serena
Hey, mom.

  Lily
Guess what I found for you... a dress for 'Kiss On The Lips'. I saw the invitation on the nightstand.

  Serena
Oh, uhm, I'm not going to that.

  Lily
What do you mean? Blair's throwing it.

  Serena
Yeah, uhm... see the problem is I... by the time I got the invitation... I uhm, actually already had plans.

  Lily
Plans with whom?

  Serena
My friend.

Eh, yeah, hi, nice to meet you Misses van der Woodsen. I'm Dan... Humphrey.

We... uhm...

  Dan
Eh, we're going to a concert tonight.

  Lily
Lincon Hawk?

  Dan
Yeah, 'Rolling Stone' named them one of the 'Top 10 Forgotten Bands Of The '90s'.

  Serena
Whooh! I'm a huge fan.

  Dan
Uh-hum.

  Lily
Well, this party would have been the perfect opportunity for you to announce your return but I guess I'll just keep the dress for myself.

[Lily walks off]

  Serena
Thank you.

  Dan
Yeah, no, I... it's not a problem, really.

[Dan starts walking off]

  Serena
So pick me up at eight?

  Dan
You really go out with some guy you don't know?

  Serena
Well, you can't be worse than the guys I do know.

[INT JAPANESE RESTAURANT - Blair and Nate are having dinner]

  Nate
Thanks for meeting me. Look, Blair, I really hurt you and I know that and I want to fix it.

  Blair
Really? And how are you gonna do that?

  Nate
I'm gonna put everything in the past. I'm not gonna see Serena again or even talk to her. It'll be like she doesn't exist.

  Blair
I think that's a good idea. Let's not mention it again. You gonna eat that?

[Blair picks up a piece of sushi from Nate's plate]

  Nate
That's it? 'Cause you were pretty upset last night... I mean, should we talk about this?

  Blair
There is nothing to talk about. I overreacted... you say it's in the past, it's in the past. I'm sure you have no feelings for her anymore. I just feel bad for Serena... she'll really miss you. What time does the limo come?

  Nate
Eight.

  Blair
Perfect.

Well, your kids were about to meet, it's a small island.

  Like you said
Small island.

  Rufus

  Oh, I get it
You hear about Alison, use your daughter as an excuse to start something.

  Lily
Yeah, in your dream!

  Rufus
Well, you are in my dreams, Lily... and one of them particular occurs finding you in the back of a Nine Inch Nails bus with your shoes in your earrings and Trent Reznor... oh, that happened!

  Lily
No need to rehash details of decades pass. So I moved on.

  Rufus
Yeah, from Chanterlane to Paris until you switched up rock stars for billionaires.

  Lily
You think you're so cute. Washed up band, crappy so-called 'art gallery'.

  Rufus
Well, not all of us have settlements from mulitple divorcs to sustain us.

  Lily
Just stay out of my life, Rufus!

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - Jenny and Dan are standing in front of a mirror, getting ready to go out]

Thanks.

  Eleanor
This one is not as elegant a choice as that one.

  Blair
Why do you care so much?

  Eleanor
Because I love you. Blair, you will never be more beautiful or thin or happy than you are right now. I just want you to make the most of it.

Hey!

  Rufus
I should go tune that. Excuse me. Enjoy the show! Son, talk to you later.

[Rufus leaves]

How into you I am.

Sorry, nothing, nothing. I just, uhm... my sister was right: You're nice.

  Serena
You asked my out on a date and you didn't think I was nice?

  Dan
No, uh... I just thought you were hot. And technically, you asked me out.

  Serena
Oh, ok, ok, I see. So, uhm, sensible tortured soul boy is actually kind of superficial.

  Dan
Yeah, just a little bit.

  Serena
Good to know.

Well, our kids were about to meet. It's a small island.

  Lily
You're sure it's not some ploy your using my daughter to get to me? Now that your wife left you?

[INT 'KISS ON THE LIPS' PARTY - Dan and Serena are walking through the crowd]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Serena and her mystery man made a surprise appearance at Blair's 'Kiss On The Lips' party.

  Isabel and Katy
Serena's here?

  Blair
What is she doing here? She wasn't invited.

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
But Serena wasn't the only one who made an impression.

[INT 'KISS ON THE LIPS' PARTY - Chuck notices Jenny]

  Chuck
Who's the newbie?

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Jenny made an impression on Chuck.

  Chuck
Let's go and talk somewhere private.

[EXT ROOF TOP - Chuck tries violently to kiss Jenny]

  Jenny
No, stop!

  Dan
Hey! That is my little sister!

[EXT ROOF TOP - Dan punches Chuck in the face]

  Serena
Don't you ever touch her again!

  Chuck
Hey, you're life is over, slut!

[EXT 'KISS ON THE LIPS' PARTY - Blair and Chuck watch Dan, Jenny and Serena get into a cab]

  Blair
She better not show her face again.

  Chuck
I'm actually hoping she will.

  Dan
So, think I've got a shot at a second date?

  Serena
We talk about it in the cab.

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
And now that S is back... will the Upper East Side ever be the same? We're all just dying to see what happens next.

      END OF TEASER

[EXT NEW YORK]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
I bet you're wondering what Gossip Girl is doing up so early. Truth is: I never went to bed. Why waste precious time dreaming when waking life is so much better?

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - KITCHEN - Ice cubes are thrown into a bucket, lemons and cucumbers are being sliced, eggs scrambled]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Is there really anything better than a lazy sunday? Reading the paper in bed, sipping coffee, scrambling an egg or two. Yeah, right. We Upper East Siders don't do lazy: Breakfast is brunch and it comes with champagne, a dress code and a hundred of our closest friends... and enemies.

[Tables get decorated, flowers arranged, strawberries are being dipped in chocolate]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Chuck's dad Bart Bass is hosting the annual brunch for his foundation. Everyone is invited. Well, not everyone.

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - Dan opens a garage door which seperates his room from his sister's]

  Dan
Oh, hey, you're up.

  Jenny
And you're checking up on me. I'm ok, really, I'm ok. You know, I was ok when you asked me at the party and in the cab, when we got home, before and after I brushed my teeth. Well, I just feel really... stupid. I mean, how could I'Ve actually thought that Chuck Bass just wanted to talk to me?

  Dan
Because you trust people which is normally a good thing.

  Jenny
Yeah, except when it involes Chuck.

  Dan
Yeah, pretty much.

  Jenny

  So, the real question is
How are you?

  Dan
Me? Why wouldn't I be ok?

  Jenny
You know, at the end of the night with Serena and the... the...

[Jenny makes a waving gesture]

  Dan
Was it really that bad?

[FLASHBACK - LAST NIGHT - CAB - Jenny, Dan and Serena are sitting in the cab, Serena is getting out, then stops]

  Serena
This is me. So, good night.

  Dan
Yeah, uhm, yeah, good night.

[Serena gets out of the cab]

  Jenny
Go! Walk her to the door! Something! Go!

[Dan nods and tries to get out of the cab but the doors slams into his head, the cab starts to drive off]

  Jenny
Whoa, stop, stop, sir, stop, stop!

  Dan
I think I have brain damage.

  Jenny
You know, Dan, if you had brain damage you wouldn't even know you had brain damage.

  Dan
No, let's go, please. Williamsburg.

  Jenny
No!

[Serena looks inside through the side window}

  Dan
Hi.

[Dan waves at Serena, the cab drives off, Serena looks puzzled after the cab and waves slightly]

[INT OSTROFF CENTER - ERIK'S ROOM - Erik is sitting on his chair, looking at his hand]

  Erik
So he waved? I wouldn't have taken him for a waver.

  Serena
No, he was just trying to be funny.

  Erik
Or maybe he is shy.

  Serena
Or he hates me.

  Erik
No guy in the history of the world has ever hated you.

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPRHEYS - JENNY'S ROOM - Dan is pacing up and down, Jenny is lying on her bad looking through a magazine]

  Dan
She probably thinks I hate her now. I waited my entire adolescent life for a date with this girl. You know, Serena van der Woodsen! And I decided to close the evening with a wave.

  Jenny
It was a nice wave.

  Dan
At the end of a date? Come on, there's no such thing. And you only get one shot with a girl like Serena. I got mine and I blew it.

  Jenny
Which means you've got nothing to loose.

  Dan
Nothing except my last shred of dignity.

  Jenny
Oh no, I think that's gone.

  Dan
You're right. You know, I'll just... I'll go talk to here. I'm gonna apologise for the wave, I gonna tell her how much I like her and I'm gonna ask for a second shot... and I'm gonna get a second shot.

  Jenny
Yeah you are!

  Dan
Yeah.

[Dan walks out of the room]

  Jenny
Wait, wait, wait! I love the plan but uhm... you need a better outfit... and maybe a shower.

[Dan heads into his room and closes the garage door]

[INT ERIK'S ROOM - Serena is pacing up and down]

  Serena
Whatever, it is probably for the best. The last thing I need in my life is another guy. He was just so smart, though, and funny...

  Erik
It sounds like you like him.

  Serena
... and really nice. God, Blair was so plain to me last night. I don't even know why. Whatever, I'm sure if we talk about it we can work it out. Hey, maybe I should go over there.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - LIVING ROOM - A note is clipped to a dress: Went to Paris. Bruch at 2. Wear pearls! Eleanor Waldorf, New York]

  Blair
Serena had better just stay away. Thank you, Dohertha!

  Isabel
Thanks!

  Katy
We were sleeping on flares last night.

  Blair
I don't want to see Serena at school and she better not show up at brunch today.

  Katy
You're really mad at Serena.

  Isabel
I hope you never get that mad at us.

  Blair
Well, you would never do what Serena did.

  Katy
No, never.

  Isabel
'Course not.

[Isabel looks puzzled at Katy who shrugs her shoulders]

  Blair
I wonder if Nate remembered brunch. It would be so wrong of me to show up without my boyfriend whom I love... and who loves me.

[Blair calls Nate]

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - CHUCK'S ROOM - Nate's cell phone is vibrating on a table covered with cards and poker chips, Nate wakes up on the couch and answers the phone]

  Nate
Hello?

[INT THE WALDORF'S LIVING ROOM]

  Blair
Hi sweety. Did I wake you?

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - CHUCK'S ROOM]

  Nate
No, I'm up.

[INT THE WALDORF'S LIVING ROOM]

  Blair
Well, get some strong coffee and jump in the shower, sleepyhead. Chuck's dad's brunch for his foundation is today at The Palace.

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - CHUCK'S ROOM]

  Nate
Ah, great, of course.

[Nate hangs up the phone and throws it onto the table, the noise wakes up Chuck who is lying in bed with two women]

  Chuck
Nathaniel! Keep it down! Some of us are trying to regain our strength.

  Nate
Your dad's brunch is today.

  Chuck
The alarm's set for nine.

  Nate
It's ten.

[Chuck sighs, then raises and claps his hands, he has a black eye]

  Chuck
Ladies, double time! Oh, unless... Nathaniel?

[Chuck points behind him at the two women]

  Nate
I'm good.

[The two women wear maid uniforms and Nate addresses them]

  Nate
Actually, could you two bring some coffee when you get a chance? And some water, lots of water.

  Maid
You want ice with that?

[She points at Chuck's black eye]

  Maid
Looks like you could use some.

  Chuck
That's enough, ladies. And I'll make sure to tell my father just how committed you are to the hospitality industry.

  Nate
That kid popped you pretty good, huh? Never mess with a guy's sister.

  Chuck
If I knew his name I'd hunt him down and kill him.

  Nate
What, 'cause you kill people now? Are you gonna strangle him with your scarf?

[Nate throws Chuck's scarf into his face, Chuck is preparing a hangover remedy in a blender]

  Chuck
Don't mock the scarf, Nathaniel. It's my signature.

  Nate

  Just saying, death by scarf. Not that intimidating.

  Chuck
He sucker-punched me, I told you. Besides, better a broken nose than a broken heart.

  Nate
What? I didn't even talk to Serena last night.

  Chuck
Who said anything about Serena?

[INT JENNY'S ROOM - Dan opens the garage door, he has changed his clothes]

  Dan
Do I look ok?

  Jenny
Definitely second shot material.

  Dan
Alright then, I'm gonna go. Oh, uhm, and about what happened, you know, with Chuck... if you want to talk to someone... not your brother, just let me know.

  Jenny
Ok.

  Dan
Yeah, alright.

  Jenny
Hey, there wait! Actually, there is someone I want to talk to.

[Jenny grabs her purse and they prepare to leave, Rufus comes home]

  Dan
Hey!

  Rufus
Hey, where are you guys going? I was going to make waffles.

  Dan
Uh, sorry dad.

  Jenny
Yeah, can't.

  Rufus
But I want to hear about your date.

  Dan
Later.

  Rufus
And your party.

  Jenny
When I get back?

  Rufus
You guys missed a really great show! And I make really good waffles!

[Dan and Jenny leave]

[THE PALACE HOTEL - CHUCK'S ROOM - Nate is on the phone]

  Concierge
The Palace Hotel.

  Nate
Hi, this is Nate Archibald, calling from the Bass suite. I know you don't normally give out this information but could you tell me what room the van der woodsens are in, please?

[EXT NEW YORK - Serena is walking down the street, she is leaving Blair a message on the phone]

  Serena
Hey, Blair, it's me. Eh, I guess you're still sleeping but I'm gonna come over. I think we need to talk. Ok, ehm, see you soon. Bye.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Blair checks her missed calls: Serena, she deletes it]

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BALL ROOM - All the tables are decorated]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Looks like the tables are all set. As soon as the guests arrive we can start dishing. Here's what's on the menue:

[FLASHFORWARD - Serena, Blair, Dan, Chuck, Jenny, Nate, Dan, Blair, Serena, Chuck walks towards Dan but Nate stops him, Blair takes off a blue dress, Jenny is wearing Blair's blue dress and looks at herself in a mirror, Chuck gives Blair a key, Blair and Nate are kissing in an elevator, Blair turns around rapidly]

[THE PALACE HOTEL - THE ROOM OF THE VAN DER WOODSENS - Serena is searching through boxes]

  Serena
Mom, did you borrow my Michelle Parise? Uh, I can't find anything in here!

  Lily
Well, it might help if you unpacked. Look, you're home now, it's your life, you should start living it.

  Serena
This is not live, this is a hotel we're living in because you decided you didn't like the colour of the walls in our real home.

[Lily hands Serena the green pair of pumps she was looking for]

  Serena
Mom, I said I'd go to this brunch. What else do you want from me?

  Lily
Serena, why are you being like this? You love parties. This is just not like you.

  Serena
Maybe it is like me. Maybe you don't know what I'm really like.

  Lily
Oh, ok, tell me.

[Serena puts on her pumps and just stares at her mother]

  Lily
So did you and Dan have fun at the concert last night?

  Serena
We, uhm, never made it. We actually ended up at the 'Kiss On The Lips' party.

  Lily
Ah, well that must have pleased Blair.

  Serena
Blair? Actually no, not that pleased. Which is why I'm going to talk to her.

  Lily
Just be back in time for brunch, ok?

  Serena
Mom!

  Lily
Look, honey, I know how hard it is for you to be back but the more you hide yourself away the more people are gonna think you have something to hide.

  Serena
Coming from someone who's keeping my brother in an institution.

  Lily
That's different.

[Serena leaves, Lily shouts after her]

  Lily

  I mean it
Don't be late!

[EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Serena runs to get a cab]

  Serena
Wait!

[Serena gets into the cab just as Dan walks up to The Palace Hotel, Dan enters and walks over to the reception]

  Dan
Hey! How are you doing? I, ah, I was in yesterday with Serena.

  Concierge
How could I forget.

  Dan
Yeah, well, is... she in?

  Concierge
Just missed her, actually, but you're welome to wait.

  Dan
Ok, maybe I will. She probably won't be that long, right?

  Concierge
Once she went out and didn't come back for six month but feel free to sit.

[Dan points behind him towards a lounge, the concierge points into the opposite direction]

  Concierge
Over there.

  Dan
Over there is where I'll be.

[Dan walks off, Nate walks towards the elevator, the door opens and Lily steps out]

  Lily
Hi, Nate, it's great to see you.

  Nate
Hi, Misses van der Woodsen. Good to see you.

  Lily
Oh, I'm just heading out.

[Nate accompanies Lily through the foyer]

  Nate
Oh, is Serena in?

  Lily
Oh, you just missed her but I'll tell her you came by. I'm sure she will be happy to hear it.

  Nate
I... I don't know about that.

  Lily
Oh, what? I mean, Serena loves you and I think she's always a little crush on you. 'Course you and Blair are the perfect couple.

  Nate
Mmh, is Serena going to be long? I could just wait.

[They arrive at the reception, Lily nods towards the concierge]

  Lily
Uhm, well, Dexter here can take care of you. I'm just gonna step out for a while and Nate's gonna wait for Serena.

  Nate
Great.

  Concierge
He can get in line behind that guy.

[The concierge points towards Dan who's sitting in a chair behind them, Lily and Nate turn around]

  Lily
I had a feeling you'd be back. Dan, is it?

[Dan gets up and shakes her hand]

  Dan
Humphrey, yes. It's nice to see you again, Misses van der Woodsen. I hope you had a pleasant, eh, 21 hours since I last saw you.

  Lily
Yes, it has been very pleasant... until now. Gentlemen...

[Lily turn around and walks off, Nate and Dan stare at each other]

  Nate
Hey.

  Dan
Hey.

[Nate and Dan sit down next to each other]

[HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Serena exits the elevator]

  Serena
Blair? Hey.

  Blair
Serena.

[Serena takes a copy of 'Breakfast At Tiffany's' out of a bag]

  Serena
Hey., I got two baguettes and Audrey.

  Blair
I must have totally blanked on the part where I invited you over.

  Serena
I... I called you. Blair, it's Sunday morning: Coffee, croissants, 'Breakfast At Tiffany's'. It's our tradition.

  Blair
I have new traditions now.

  Serena
Well, they're not traditions if they're new.

[Blair sits down with the Sunday paper and ignores Serena]

  Serena
Look, Blair, I'm really trying to make an effort here. I thought everything was good between us.

  Blair
It was... before I found out you had s*x with my boyfriend.

[Serena is looking for words, Blair just stares at her]

  Serena
How did you find out?

  Blair
Nate told me. At least he felt he owed it to me to tell the truth.

  Serena
I don't know what to say.

  Blair
Don't bother saying anything. I wouldn't believe you anyway.

  Serena
Blair, it was...

  Blair
You know... I always knew you're a whore... I never took you for a liar too.

  Serena
Blair, how can I fix this?

  Blair
You don't, Serena. You just stay away from me, my boyfriend and my friends. You're done here.

[Blair walks away and leaves Serena behind]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Serena's visit was short and apparently not very sweet but you know what is? Revenge. We hear it's best served cold. Who's hungry?

[Serena has already left, Jenny exits the elevator and enters the living room, Blair shouts from the other room]

  Blair
Dohertha, I told you I didn't want to see anyone!

[Blair enters the living room and sees Jenny]

  Blair
Hey, Jenny.

  Jenny
Hi.

  Blair
What do you want?

  Jenny
Eh, I realised that I still have your calligraphy pens... from the party invitations and thought you might need them for something.

  Blair
That's the lamest excuse I've ever heard. You wanna know what Chuck Bass is saying about you.

  Jenny
No. Is he... saying things? Is anyone?

  Blair
Mmh, no. Not yet anyway. Chuck likes to brag about his conquests not his victims. Come on, you can help me get ready for brunch.

  Jenny
Ok, sure.

[Blair leads Jenny upstairs, Jenny notices an arrangement of flowers]

  Jenny
Nice flowers.

  Blair
They're hydrangeas.

[EXT NEW YORK - Lily gets out of a cab]

  Lily
Just coffee. I'm not staying long... I want to get out of here before someone throws me down and tattoos me.

  Rufus
This is Brooklyn, Lil, not the 'Warped Tour' and don't tell me you had all your tattoos removed. I mean, even that one the little heart-shaped one between your, uhm...

  Lily
Don't try to be cute, ok. Those days are way behind you.

  Rufus
And here I thought I was getting better looking every day. So, what's the big emergency?

  Lily
Dan went out with Serena last night.

  Rufus
And as Humphrey I sure am proud of him.

[They walk into a coffee shop]

  Lily
Well, currently he is sitting in the lobby of the hotel where we're living.

  Shop Assistent
Hi, how can I help you?

  Rufus
Two americanos, one with an extra shot?

  Lily
Mhm.

  Rufus
You don't actually think that I'm gonna tell my kid you he can and cannot date. I mean is that really the reason you came down here?

  Lily
Oh, I know what you're implying.

  Rufus
That maybe you're falling for me again.

  Lily
You're right, you're right. It's the low income tax bracket, the bad v-neck t-shirts, the awful jokes. I don't know why your wife left you.

  Rufus
Well, she's got better taste than you.

[The shop assistant brings them their coffee, Rufus pays]

  Shop Assistent
Here you are. Thanks.

  Rufus
I mean, come on, why else have I seen you more in the last two days than in the last fifteen years?

  Lily
An unfortunate twist of fate.

  Rufus
But fate non the less, unless... you are... are you seeing someone?

  Lily
No, not really.

  Rufus
Aha, not serious... or he's married, that is your type.

  Lily
That's enough, Rufus.

  Rufus
What's his name? Have I read of him in 'Forbes' or 'Rolling Stone'? Well, whoever he is I'm sure he can't keep up with you.

  Lily
Well, I'm gonna take that as a compliment. But I'm serious, I'm worried about Serena. I don't need some new boy influencing her, distracting her from her needs.

  Rufus
Well, no offense, Lil, but I'm guessing a kid like Dan is exactly what Serena needs.

[EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Dan walks away from the main entrance, he meets Nate at the front gate]

  Dan
So, ah, what do you need to talk to Serena about?

  Nate
Nothing, just in the neighborhood. You?

  Dan
I... I'm nowhere near the neighborhood but I'm working on a better excuse.

  Nate
You guys like...

  Dan
Oh, ah, I... I don't know.

  Nate
Yeah, well, that's Serena. With her you'll never know.

[Chuck walks towards them, he is wearing black sunglasses]

  Chuck
Nathaniel! There you are. What are you doing?

  Nate
Nothing... just waiting for you.

[Chuck notices Dan, he takes of his sunglasses and reveales his black eye]

  Chuck
Him? What are you doing here?

  Dan
Why? What is this... your hotel?

  Nate
Actually, it is.

  Chuck
Yes and unless you have a reason to be here I have to ask you to wait on the curb with the rest of the trash.

  Dan
Trash? Look man, I live in Brooklyn, alright, not the Ozarks... no offense to the Ozarks. But don't you think we're taking this class warfare thing way too far?

[Chuck pushes Dan, Nate keeps him back]

  Nate
Ok, man, let's just go.

  Chuck
You told me stick it up for Serena's reputation... if anyone has a reason to kick his ass it's you.

  Nate
It's no warfare. Not here.

[Nate leads Chuck away from Dan, Chuck turns to Dan]

  Chuck
This isn't over.

  Dan
Hey, any time, man. That one black eys looks a little lonely.

[BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Blair is trying on the blue dress her mother laid out for her to wear to the brunch, Jenny is with her]

  Jenny
Wow, Blair, it's... it's beautiful. I mean... you look beautiful.

  Blair
It's average. The collar is last season. And besides, Stella McCartney's a much better version of Bergdorf's.

[Blair takes the dress off]

  Jenny
Right. I... I've been meaning to go by Bergdorf's.

[Jenny walks over to Blair's bed and picks up a doll]

  Jenny
Wow, these dolls are great. Oh my god, you've got 'Cabbage Patch'. My brother used to have one of these. His name was Cedric.

  Blair
You're brother's name is Cedric?

  Jenny
No, that was his 'Cabbage Patch Kid'. My brother's name is Dan. Actually, you might know him. He, uhm, he went out with Serena last night.

  Blair
That was your brother? So does that mean you're friends with Serena now?

  Jenny
I mean, I don't have a problem with her but if someone did have a problem with her I wouldn't have a problem with that either.

  Blair
You know if you like that dress... you can have it.

  Jenny
What? No, no.

  Blair
I'm sure you'll find some way to repay me.

  Jenny
Wow, Blair, thank you, I mean, for the dress and... for the other thing... about that Chuck.

  Blair
If you want to be part of this world, Jenny, people will talk... eventually. And you need to decide if all this... is worth it.

[EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Dan is waiting for Serena, she walks up to him]

  Serena
Dan, hey.

  Dan
I, I... I was in the neighborhood... uhm, give or take seventy blocks. Uhm, I just wanted to tell you in person that, eh, the end of last night may not have been my finest hour. It was a, eh, a wave.

[Dan makes a waving gesture]

  Serena
I, I... I saw that.

  Dan
Yeah, yeah. Since then I've just been wondering... eh... are you hungry?

  Serena
Yes. Actually, I had the worst morning.

  Dan
Do you... do you wanna talk? And eat? Not necessarily in that order.

  Serena
Yes, I would love to do both but food first because I'm starving.

[Lily walks up to them]

  Lily
Great, just in time for brunch.

  Serena
Mom.

  Dan
Miss van der Woodsen.

  Lily
Dan, you're still here.

  Serena
Look, mom, I really don't think it's a good idea for me to go to that brunch.

  Lily
You promised.

  Serena
Yeah, but that was before... before I knew Dan was hungry too. I can't let the boy starve.

  Dan
It would be inhumane.

  Lily
He's not invited.

  Serena
Yeah, that's why I'm going with him.

  Dan
Because I can't go with her.

  Serena
And we have plans to go to brunch together today.

  Dan
We had those plans.

  Lily

  Serena, you're home
Living under my roof, my rules. What is it gonna take to get you dressed and through that door?

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BALL ROOM - Dan and Serena stand at the entrance, Dan looks a little overwhelmed, there are models painted white to pose as statues, Howie Archibald, Bart Brass and Lily are all there, Nate, Chuck, Blair, Katy and Isabel are sitting together laughing and drinking, Blair notices Serena and her mouth drops]

  Serena
You know, maybe... maybe this was a... a bad idea.

[Back at the table]

  Blair
You got to be kidding.

[Back at the entrance]

  Dan
Yeah, this was... this was definitely a bad idea

[Back at the table, Chuck notices Dan]

  Chuck
This should be fun.

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Looks like Chuck and Blair showed up with quite some appetite... for destruction that is.

[Dan and Serena finally enter the ball room]

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - Rufus is playing the guitar, Jenny enters with her new blue dress in a transparent cloth bag]

  Jenny
Hey, dad. How's the new song going?

  Rufus
Ah, I think I need more coffee.

  Jenny
Whatever works.

[Rufus notices the dress]

  Rufus
Where did you get the dress?

  Jenny
Oh, it was a thank you gift from Blair for doing the party invitations.

  Rufus
Looks like a very expensive thank you gift.

  Jenny
Dad, she's got a closed the size of this appartement just full of them. See, her mom designed it.

  Rufus
And her mom is very talented... but the dress you made for yourself is much nicer.

  Jenny
Which is why you don't wear dresses.

  Rufus
One of a couple reasons.

  Jenny
Hey, you think the Farmers' Market is still open?

  Rufus
Yeah, why? You wanna go?

  Jenny
Yeah.

  Rufus
I thought you were getting too old to go places with your dad.

  Jenny
Well, you used to be cool. And the '90s are having a comeback.

  Rufus
You have no idea how much that hurts.

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BALL ROOM - Dan and Serena are standing at the decadent buffet]

  Dan
Well, can't say much for his child bearing skills but Bart Brass knows brunch.

[Serena notices Nate who nods towards her to signal he wants to talk to her outside]

  Serena
Uhm, I... I need to use the ladies' room. You think you be ok for yourself for a while?

  Dan
Yeah, come on, me and some Beluga caviar? Can't get enough of this stuff.

  Serena
Ok.

[Serena leaves, Dan turns to one of the painted models]

  Dan
Hey, how's it going?

[The model doesn't answer or move]

  Dan
No? You don't... ok, just... go ahead do your thing.

[Dan turns around and finds Chuck, they stare at each other for a while until Chuck turns to his father]

  Bart
Charles!

[Bart turns away from a guest]

  Bart
Would you excuse me?

  Guest
Of course.

  Chuck
Father.

  Bart
The, uh, the invitation said 'Black Tie' not 'Black Eye'. Are you ok? I mean if you're in some kind of trouble...

  Chuck
Only of my own making.

  Bart
Why do you think I do all this, hu? This party is for you. Ok, so you can meet people. You know, become a part of something, make some kind of change.

  Chuck
Really? I thought it was another excuse for an open bar and, eh, re-hiring the milanese statues.

  Bart
Do me a favour, will you? Lose the scotch... it's barely noon.

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - OUTSIDE OF THE BALL ROOM - Nate is waiting, Serena arrives]

  Nate
Serena, I really need to talk to you.

  Serena
Actually, I need to talk to you which means you can listen. Nate, you told Blair! What were you thinking?

  Nate
Look, I wanna explain...

[A party guest interrupts them because they're standing in her way]

  Guest
Excuse me.

  Nate
Sorry.

[They move a little apart and let her through]

  Nate
We can't talk here.

  Serena
What? Where Blair might see us?

  Nate
Meet me in Chuck's suite.

[Nate talks a key out of his pocket]

  Serena
I'm not sneaking around with you.

  Nate
Please, just to talk.

[Serena takes the key]

  Serena
Ten minutes.

  Nate
I meet you up there.

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BALL ROOM - Howie is talking to Blair]

  Howie
You look beautiful as always. Where's you're lovely mother today?

  Blair
Paris. Must be some drama at the atelier.

  Howie
Nothing too dramatic, I hope. Her line is doing very well. I was just telling my firm what a great investment she'd make. She's really going places.

  Blair
Hopefully places far far away. Just kidding.

[Nate walks over and takes Blair's empty glass]

  Nate
Hey. I'll get you a refill. I'll be right back.

  Howie
I'll go with you. Excuse us.

[Nate kisses Blair on the cheek and they walk away]

  Howie
Blair seems happy. Looks like... you're taking care of business as we discussed.

  Nate
Dad, not everything in life's a business deal.

  Howie
Come talk to me in thirty years.

[They walk up to a guest]

  Howie
I want to introduce you to Timothy Good. His firm has some really interessting summer interships.

[Nate and Mr. Good shake hands]

  Nate
Hey.

  Mr. Good
Nice to meet you.

[Chuck walks up to Blair]

  Blair
I can't believe Serena came to this brunch. I told her to stay away.

  Chuck
You worried about Nate? Just a shot in the dark. I think you know what you need to do to get his attention.

[Chuck offers her a key]

  Blair
And what's that?

  Chuck
A key to my suite, Nate's heart and your future happiness.

[Blair takes the key]

  Chuck
I'm honored to be playing an even small role in your deflowering.

  Blair
You're disgusting.

  Chuck
Yes, I am. So why be shy? Just grab Nate and finish this. Report back with details.

[Blair walks off]

[Blair walks over to Nate who is just saying goodbye to Mr. Good and his father]

  Nate
Nice to meet you. Dad.

  Blair
What are you doing right now?

  Nate
Ah, well, I was just gonna...

  Blair
What about me?

  Nate
Uhm...

  Blair
Do you have a better offer or...

  Nate
No, of course not.

  Blair
Yeah?

  Nate
Now?

  Blair
Now. Now.

[Blair and Nate leave, Chuck looks after them]

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - The elevator doors open and reveal Nate and Blair kissing]

  Nate
Where are we going?

  Blair
I've got us the best room in the whole place.

[INT CHUCK'S ROOM - Blair pushes Nate through the door]

  Nate
Wait, this is Chuck's room.

[Serena is already there]

  Serena
Nate...

[Blair looks at Serena in disbelief]

  Blair
Serena?

  Serena
Blair.

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Spotted. N and B, hot and heavy in the halls of The Palace Hotel, only to find S already waiting. Sparks were flying for sure... but will it be a three-way? Or D-day?

  Blair
What is she doing here?

  Serena
I was waiting for Nate.

  Nate
Just to talk, I swear.

  Blair
You said you'd never speak to her again!

  Serena
You said that? Why would you say that?

  Blair
Because you can't be trusted!

  Nate
It's not Serena's fault.

  Blair
Do not defend her!

  Nate
I asked her to come.

  Blair
Oh, oh, so you want to talk to her.

  Nate
Yes. Yes, to explain... why I'm not talking to her.

  Blair
Maybe I leave you two to finish that fascinating conversation.

  Serena
Uh, no, no, I'll go. Let you guys get back to your quicky.

  Blair
It wasn't a quicky. s*x is actually kind of a big deal to some of us.

  Serena
Oh, yeah, I can see that. Chuck's bed? Very romantic. Classy too.

  Blair
Oh, like you. I bet your new friend Dan would love to hear all about how classy you are.

  Serena
Dan? What...

[Blair runs off]

  Serena
God, do you really think she's gonna tell him?

  Nate
It's Blair.

[They run after her]

  Serena
I can't believe you told her.

  Nate
You just expected me to keep it a secret?

  Serena
Yes, Nate. There's nothing wrong with keeping a secret if the truth is gonna hurt someone!

  Nate
That's a hell of a way to look at things.

  Serena
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realise in all this you were the most honest guy on the planet.

[EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Dan is stepping outside to look for Serena, he sees Bart and Lily talking to each other]

  Bart
It just seems to me that you're the one doesn't want to be seen together in public.

  Lily
No, I do want to be seen together. I just don't want to see you together with anyone else. Tell your harem of shopgirls and models that you're seeing someone.

  Bart
I am... but those conversations take a little time.

  Lily
Well, they got nothing but time, Bart, they're twenty-five.

[Lily notices Dan standing by the entrance looking at them]

  Lily
Excuse me.

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - Dan walks back inside, Lily follows him]

  Lily
Dan, wait! Look, I really don't appreciate your lurking in the shadows eavesdropping on my private conversation.

  Dan
What? No, no, I wasn't. I was looking for Serena.

  Lily
Well, I don't see her. Do you?

  Dan
No, which is why I was looking.

  Dan
I don't know what you're doing here or what you think you heard...

  Dan
Nothing, I heard nothing.

  Lily
But Serena doesn't know.

  Dan
And neither do I, ok? So now if you excuse me, I'm gonna go back inside, not tell anyone a thing and mind my own business.

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BALL ROOM - Blair walks up to Dan]

  Blair
Dan? Hi, I'm Blair Waldorf, Serena's friend.

  Dan
Oh, hey. Yeah, do you happen to know where she is?

  Blair
As a matter of fact I do.

[Serena and Nate come running in]

  Serena
Blair!

  Dan
Serena, there you are.

  Serena
Hi.

  Dan
Where were you?

  Blair
She was waiting in a hotel room... for my boyfriend.

  Serena
To talk!

  Nate
About why we weren't talking.

  Blair
That doesn't sound any smarter the second time.

  Dan
Why weren't you talking? Does this have anything to do with why you were waiting for Serena this morning?

  Blair
You were what?

[Chuck joins them]

  Chuck
And here I thought you were waiting for me.

  Oh, exactly what the situation needs
Chuck. No what is going on here?

  Blair
We were just getting to that.

  Serena
Blair, please, don't do this.

  Blair
Sorry, did you want to tell him?

  Chuck
I'll tell him.

  Nate and Blair
You know?

  Chuck
I know everything.

  Dan
And apparently I know nothing.

  Serena
Look, Dan, it was a long time ago and I regret it...

  Chuck
Look, Serena, stop trying to pretend you're a good girl. So you slept with best friend's boyfriend. I kind of admire you for it.

  Dan
Is that true?

  Blair
Well, than she ran away and lied about it. I just thought you should know before you fall head over heels for your perfect girl in her perfect world... and then get left all alone with no one but your 'Cabbage Patch Kid'.

  Nate
'Cabbage Patch'?

  Dan
Did you talk to my sister?

  Chuck
Ah, yes, little Jenny. Do believe she and I have some unfinished business.

[Dan walks up close to Chuck]

  Dan
You stay away from her.

  Chuck
Poor devil, so little time so many sluts to fu...

[Dan pushes Chuck who crushes into a waiter causing him to fall down, all guests turn around to look at the scene, Katy is making photos with her cell phone while Isabel is texting]

  Dan
It's fine! It's fine! Everyone can stop looking. He's a jerk. But it's my fault and... and I'm leaving.

  Serena
I'll go with you.

  Dan
Actually, I'd prefer if you didn't.

[Dan walks off]

  Nate
Hope you're happy.

  Blair
Not even close.

[Blair walks off, Nate follows her]

  Chuck
Looks like it's just you and me. Apparently my room's available if...

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Some might call this a fustercluck... but on the Upper East Side we call it Sunday afternoon.

[EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Serena is running after Dan]

  Serena
Dan! Dan, wait! I'm so sorry.

  Dan
There's... there's no need to be, really. I shouldn't have come here today. I made a mistake.

  Serena
No, you didn't. Look, I'm sorry about Blair and Chuck...

  Dan
It's not about Blair or Chuck... I mean, it is but it's not just them.

  Serena
No, I know. Trust me, I know. This world... it's crazy.

  Dan
Yeah, yeah it is... and you're part of it.

  Serena
What... and you didn't know that?

  Dan
I don't know... I thought you were different.

[Dan turns around and starts walking away]

  Serena
Well, I'm sorry I'm not who you thought I was. But.. what's happened is in the past, you know.

[Dan stops]

  Serena
And all that I can do is try to change. But if you can't accept that then... you know... you're not who I thought you were. Well, I guess we both made mistakes.

[Serena walks away from Dan, Dan looks after her, then starts walking, Serena turns around but Dan is leaving]

[HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - KITCHEN - Dan is sitting at the counter drinking tea, Jenny and Rufus come home, Jenny is holding a pot with flowers]

  Jenny
Hi.

  Rufus
Hey, Jen said you went looking for Serena. Did you find her?

  Dan
Yeah, yeah, I found her and then I lost her.

  Rufus
Oh, eh, that's... eh...

  Dan
It's fine. It's fine, really. It's all for the best. Serena and her friends and her family... her whole world... turns out it wasn't for me.

  Jenny
Wait, Dan. What happened?

  Jenny
Did you tell Blair Waldorf about Cedric?

  Jenny
I... it may have come up.

  Dan
You can't trust these people, Jen. Don't tell them anything. Those are nice floweres.

  Jenny
They're hydrangeas.

[HOME OF THE WALDROFS - BLAIR'S ROOM - Nate and Blair are lying in bed together, both are fully dressed, Blair has her back turned to Nate]

  Nate
Look, Blair, either you try to forgive me and move on... or we end it.

[Nate puts his hand on her shoulders and he covers it with hers]

[EXT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - Dan is stepping outside on the fire escape]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Well, Serena's mytery man is a mystery no longer. His name is... oh, who cares. Now that he and S are over... so are his fifteen minutes.

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - JENNY'S ROOM - Jenny is wearing her new blue dress and looks at herself in the mirror]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
But his sister Jenny was spotted with a new dress... gifted from Blair herself. Everyone knows an Eleanor original is the uniform of B's private army. But will J be a loyal soldier? Or will she side with S's rebel forces?

[THE PALACE HOTEL - CHUCK'S ROOM - Chuck is lying on his bed looking at 'Gossip Girl' on his cell phone, a blonde is cooling his black eye with ice]
And as for S herself: We hear she left today's brunch with... no friends, no boy and nowhere left to run.

[EXT NEW YORK - Serena is walking down the street looking at pictures of Blair, Nate and herself on her cell phone]

[HOME OF THE WALDORFS - BLAIR'S ROOM - Blair squeezes Nate's hand]

[HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - JENNY'S ROOM - Jenny is standing in front of a mirror]

[EXT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - Dan is sitting on the fire escape, staring into the night]

[EXT NEW YORK - Serena looks at a picture of herself hugging Blair]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
It looks like the ultimate insider has become a total outsider. It's your move, Serena. And you know who'll be watching: Gossip Girl.

[Serena throws her cell phone into a garbage can]

[EXT NEW YORK]

[INT LIMOUSINE - Blair, Nate, Chuck, Kati and Isabel are drinking champagne]

[INT 'KISS ON THE LIPS PARTY' - Kati is dancing]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Good morning, Upper East Siders! Gossip Girl here. Your one and only source in the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite. Top story on my homepage: Serena van der Woodsen.

[INT BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Blair and Nate in bed, half undressed]

  Nate
Serena?

  Blair
Serena's at school.

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Why did she return?

[INT OSTROFF CENTRE - HALLWAY]

  Serena
Let me guess, you told everyone that Erik's just visiting Grandpa in Rhode Island.

  Lily
Your Aunt Carol in Miami.

[INT OSTROFF CENRE - Serena is looking into her brother's room]

  Serena
He tries to take his own life and you're worried it's gonna cost you 'Mom of the Year'.

[INT OSTROFF CENTRE - ERIK'S ROOM - Erik and Serena sit on bed]

  Erik
Must be a lot of rumours why you're back.

  Serena
None of them mention you.

[INT PALACE HOTEL - LOBBY - Lily and Nate walk toward the Concierge]

  Lily
Nate's gonna wait for Serena

  Concierge
He can get in line behind that guy.

[The concierge points towards Dan who's sitting in a chair behind them]

[EXT PALACE HOTEL - Dan and Serena smile at each other]

[INT COFFEE SHOP - Lily and Rufus sit at a table]

  Lily
I don't need some new boy influencing her, distracting her from her needs.

  Rufus
A kid like Dan is exactly what Serena needs.

[INT HUMPHREY HOME - KITCHEN]

  Rufus
Guess whose dad is cool!

  Jenny
It's a trick question.

  Dan
Yeah, 'cause it can't be ours.

[INT HUMPHREY HOME - Jenny and Dan are standing in front of a mirror, getting ready to go out]

  Jenny
You're going out with Serena and I'm going to 'Kiss on the Lips'. Who said this family wasn't cool?

[INT WALDORF HOME]

  Serena
I thought everything was good between us.

  Blair
It was... before I found out you had s*x with my boyfriend

[EXT PALACE HOTEL - Lily walks up to Dan and Serena]

  Lily
Great, just in time for brunch.

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BALLROOM - Dan and Serena stand at the entrance and Chuck and Blair stand together talking]

  Nate
Just to talk

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - CHUCK'S SUITE - Nate and Blair find Serena in the suite waiting for Nate. Blair turns to speak to Nate.]

  Blair
You said you'd never speak to her again!

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BALLROOM - Serena, Dan, Chuck, Blair and Nate stand together in a circle]

  Chuck
So you slept with best friend's boyfriend. I kind of admire you for it.

  Dan
Is that true?

  Blair
Then she ran away and lied about it.

  Chuck
Poor Daniel, so little time so many sluts to defend

[Dan pushes Chuck who slams into a waiter causing him to fall down, all guests turn around to look at the scene]

[EXT THE PALACE HOTEL]

  Serena
This world... it's crazy

  Dan
And you're a part of it

[Dan turns and walks away]

[INT WALDORF HOME]

  Serena
Blair, how can I fix this?

  Blair
You don't, Serena. You just stay away.

[Blair turns and walks away]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
But now that Serena is back, will the Upper East Side ever be the same? It takes two to tangle and girls like these don't go down without a fight.

      END OF TEASER

[Glamorous by Fergie is being sung by the Constance Billard Choir. We see flashes of Blair, Serena, Dan, Nate, Chuck, Kati and Isabel getting ready for school. They are all looking at themselves in their mirrors. Blair puts on her ruby ring, Serena adjusts her tie and we see flashes of them adjusting pins, brooches and watches. Serena applies her mascara, Blair puts on a white hairband, Kati and Isabel both put on chequered hairbands Nate fixes his blazer, Chuck puts on his trademark scarf and Dan is shaving himself and cutting himself frequently. They all turn and walk away from their mirrors]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
There's plenty of upside to being the spawn of the fabulously wealthy, but the downside, super successful parents expect nothing less from their offspring and when it comes to college that means the Ivy's. It's more than just getting into college, it's setting a course for the rest of your life and for those few who aren't legacies, the pressures are no less. When parents have sacrificed for their children's future, what kid would want to let them down?

[EXT CONSTANCE/ST.JUDE'S - COURTYARD - Chuck and Nate are walking together. Blair, Kati and Isabel are walking together. Dan walks past Chuck and Nate and Chuck gives him a dirty look. Blair turns around at the entrance stairs and looks at Nate. They both smile at each other.]

[INT CONSTANCE/ST JUDE'S - Jenny and a collection of other girls are singing in front of everyone. They finish and walk away whilst a male and female teacher walk onto the stage]

  Female Teacher
Thank you ladies.

[We see Dan, Chuck, Nate, Blair Kati and Isabel watching this. Chuck looks bored.]

  Female Teacher
Good morning students. I ask all of you to show a little sympathy for our junior class. They are almost through with Ivy Week.

  Male Teacher
As is our long standing tradition, the Constance Billard girls will be in charge of Friday night's mixer and the St.Jude's boys will provide the ushers for the visiting representatives.

  Female Teacher
For those of you dreaming of attending an Ivy League school this mixer is the most important event of your life.

  Male Teacher
But no pressure.

[The male and female teacher both laugh at this and the camera zooms in on Dan]

[INT HUMPHREY HOME - KITCHEN - Rufus enters kitchen, Dan sits at the counter drinking orange juice and Jenny stands pouring herself a glass. Dan's face is covered with tissue from where he cut his face shaving]

  Rufus
It's not that bad.

  Dan
They'll think I shaved with a woodchipper.

  Jenny
I was going with more of a chainsaw.

  Dan
Not helping.

  Jenny
Not trying to.

  Rufus
Hey, look on the bright side you're not a haemophiliac, otherwise you'd be in the emergency room.

  Jenny
And that's helping?

[Dan stands up]

  Dan
Hmm... not really

[Jenny smiles and adjusts her tie. She then sits down]

  Rufus
Dartmouth's gonna love you.

  Dan
Yeah well I gotta believe that being able to shave is a prerequisite for attending.

  Rufus
No one is more qualified, no one is smarter, no one is more well rounded-

  Dan
Or wounded

[Jenny laughs]

  Dan
It's not like I've got a trust fund to fall back on Dan. All I've got is up here.

[Dan signals to his head and then brings a finger to his lips to signal for Jenny to be quiet. Rufus starts walking towards Dan]

  Rufus
Well that is the most important thing, college is about academic excellence. Besides you're going to do great in your interview, you take after your dad that way, the spotlight doesn't faze us.

  Jenny
Ooh, you better hope there's not a spotlight involved.

[Dan and Rufus both turn to Jenny with disapproving faces. Jenny just smiles]

  Jenny
I'm your sister, it's what I do.

  Dan
Not when it's about Dartmouth.

[INT CONSTANCE/ST JUDE'S -We see Dan looking stressed. Nate and Chuck are sitting together a few rows behind Dan]

  Chuck
Nathaniel, want a little wake and bake?

  Nate
We've got our interviews today.

  Chuck
My point exactly.

  Chuck
I've got my one hitter.

[Chuck shifts to the end of their row and looks back at Nate. Nate doesn't join Chuck and the camera zooms in on Nate]

[EXT CENTRAL PARK- Nate is jogging with his father Howie. Nate overtakes his father and finishes before him, they both stop jogging]

  Howie
Try not to cut me off next time; you almost knocked me over the side of the bench.

[Nate laughs]

  Nate
I didn't cut you off.

[Howie gives Nate a serious look and Nate stops laughing]

  Nate
I didn't mean to.

  Howie
If you win fair and square, nothing would make me prouder.

  Nate
Dad, we've talked about me keeping my options open, looking out West.

  Howie
Yeah of course but lets get serious here. If someone with your grades wants to get into Dartmouth, you need to appear to be working for it.

  Nate
Dad-

  Howie
Ushering the rep is a good step.

  Nate
How come everytime I bring up going to USC you act like it's a joke?

  Howie
Nate there's a plan here.

  Nate
Maybe I want to make my own plan.

  Howie
Listen, your mother and I didn't work this hard for you to make things up as you go along.

  Howie
Dartmouth, law school, Blair. Soon you're going to have everything, let's not make for work. Nail that interview today, go Green!

[Howie nudges Nate and then turns and starts jogging away. Nate is left standing there looking upset]

[INT CONSTANCE/ST JUDE'S - We see Nate sitting there with a serious look. He turns to look at Blair, who also turns to look at him. Nate then decides to shuffle to the end of the row and go outside with Chuck. Blair looks after him as he leaves.]

  Female Teacher
At tomorrow night's mixer, Blair Waldorf will announce the charity her community outreach committee will honour this year.

[Blair looks at Isabel and smiles.]

  Kati
Have you seen Serena?

  Isabel
I wonder where she is.

  Blair
Know what I wonder? How we're supposed to hear anything about Yale with all this talk about Serena.

[Kati and Isabel turn to each other with a confused look on their faces. The camera zooms in on Blair]

[INT WALDORF HOME -Blair is walking down the stairs talking to someone. She then sits down on a chaise lounge]

  Blair
Do you remember when Dad gave me my first Yale sweatshirt? I don't think any piece of clothing has ever fit me more perfect, not to mention how adorable I found that bulldog. Remember when I asked you if I could get a bulldog? Good call by the way saying no, and now the big day is finally here. Soon Nate and I will be at college, him going down to Yale, me going up to Dartmouth. Dad flying in for the Princeton game, I hope it doesn't make you feel old watching me grow up.

[The camera turns and we see that she has been talking to Dorota this whole time. Dorota turns to Blair with a breakfast tray.]

  Dorota
Eat up Miss Blair. Your mom would want you to have a good breakfast.

[Blair picks up a grape and pops it in her mouth]

[INT CONSTANCE/ST JUDE'S - We see Blair turn to Kati and Isabel]

  Blair
So Serena's really not here?

  Kati
That's what I said.

  Isabel
When you weren't supposed to be talking!

[EXT CONSTANCE/ST JUDE'S - Serena is leaving a taxi and running up the entrance stairs]

[INT PALACE HOTEL - VAN DER WOODSEN SUITE - Lily is walking over to Serena who is exiting a room and eating a piece of toast]

  Lily
Come on! Hurry up you're going to be late.

  Serena
I am... I know

  Lily
You know you shouldn't have stayed at your brother's again. Why sleep there? It's not like he can even see you, his eyes are closed.

[Serena is packing her schoolbag]

  Serena
Do you have one maternal bone in your entire body?

  Lily
Serena you need you rest, it's Ivy Week.

[Lily hands Serena a lip gloss and Serena applies it in front of the mirror]

  Serena
I know and if I can get out of this hotel room, it's my sole ambition in life to impress the Brown rep.

  Lily
I'm so thrilled to hear that that's still your plan. I know it's something we've always talked about but honestly since you've been back I've wondered if your mind was even on college.

  Serena
Mom I've had my mind on a lot of things. Since recent events, going away to college sounds pretty good.

  Lily
How... how did you leave things with Dan?

  Serena
I don't wanna talk about it.

  Lily
What's going on with you and Blair?

  Serena
Mom, please! All I wanna do is just finish high school in peace and go away to a state with people who don't know who I am and just start over, okay?

[Serena pick up her schoolbag and walks out the door. Lily walks to the door.]

  Lily
Get a cab, don't walk!

[INT CONSTANCE/ST.JUDE'S - Students including Dan are exiting the assembly. Serena runs up the stairs and stops at Dan]

  Serena
Please don't tell me it's over.

  Dan
What? You were there; I would say it's pretty over.

[Serena sighs]

  Serena
I meant the assembly.

  Dan
Alright, no, yeah, it just ended, now.

  Serena
Damn it.

  Dan
Alright, good luck

[Dan walks away past Serena]

  Serena
Yeah, you too

[Blair approaches Serena. Kati and Isabel are approaching behind Blair]

  Blair
Aww too bad you missed the assembly. Not that it matters, Brown doesn't offer degrees in slut.

[Serena makes a face then laughs as Blair, Kati and Isabel walk past her. Blair stops at the stairs and glares back at Serena, Serena simply smiles back.]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Spotted! S not so fashionably late and dressed down by B. Game on ladies.

[EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD - FIELD - Serena and Blair are playing hockey with a group of other girls. Blair and Serena are both attacking for the ball]

  Serena
Look I made a mistake with Nate ok, but you sabotaged me with Dan. We don't have to be friends-

[Blair strikes Serena down with her hockey stick. Serena stands back up again and angrily hits the air with her hockey stick. The other girls stop playing and the referee approaches them]

  Referee
Waldorf?

  Blair
Sorry, slipped.

  Serena
I'm fine.

[The referee blows the whistle and they all continue playing hockey. Serena walks past Blair]

  Serena
I really wanna believe that that was an accident.

  Blair
Then you must be delusional.

[Blair runs and jabs Serena in the side. The referee blows the whistle and gives Blair a green card. Serena turns to the referee]

  Serena
Thank you.

[The girls continue playing hockey and Blair runs at Serena with her stick and knocks her down. Serena stands back up and the referee blows his whistle and gives Blair a yellow card]

  Referee
I'm running out of colours here Blair.

[Serena approaches and moves close to Blair]

  Serena
And I'm running out of patience. Enough, okay?

  Blair
It's enough when I say it's enough.

[Blair walks away from Serena. The girls continue playing hockey. Serena runs towards Blair and knocks her to the ground. They struggle and fight on the ground. The referee blows his whistle and the other girls run to them]

  Referee
Girls break it up!

[Serena is on top of Blair and hitting her]

  Blair
Get off of me!

[Serena gets off Blair and stands up. Blair then also stands up and Serena walks closer to Blair]

  Serena
So we've actually come to physical blows, huh?

  Serena
Truce?

[Blair thinks for a moment and then smiles and starts clutching her leg in agony]

  Blair
My leg!

  Referee
Serena, you're out of here!

[Serena makes a face and Kati and Isabel run to take care of Blair]

  Serena
I hope it's broken.

[Serena then walks away and Kati and Isabel gather either side of Blair and help her to walk. Blair continues to make pained expressions and the referee examines her leg. Blair then walks off the field with the help of Kati and Isabel]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Hey Upper East Siders. We hear that World War Three just broke out and it's wearing knee socks. Choose your side or run and hide. We have a feeling that this one is to the death.

[INT ST JUDE'S - OFFICE - A Dartmouth rep is talking to Dan]

  Dartmouth Rep
Why should you be the Dartmouth Usher?

  Dan
Well, I've given this a lot of thought and I think that I can answer your question in three parts and I'd like to start with the third part. If that's cool, unless that would be confusing, in which case I can start at the beginning. The Dartmouth principles of community highlight integrity, responsibility and consideration. Well, from St. Jude's I've learnt integrity, from being an older brother I've learnt responsibility and from my parents who have sacrificed everything to send me to this school I've learnt consideration.

  Dan
It really comes down to one thing, Dartmouth is my dream and I've never asked Dartmouth but I think it's been dreaming of me. That was a joke or an attempted one. Next question.

  Dartmouth Rep
You are the ideal Dartmouth candidate.

[The camera turns to reveal that the Dartmouth rep is talking to Nate]

  Nate
Thank you sir and it would be an honour to attend Dartmouth; I've grown up hearing all about it from my father. I'm just not sure that it's my first choice and if there's only one usher position available, I'm sure there's someone who wants it more than me.

[The camera turns to show Chuck talking to a representative]

  Chuck
Why should I be chosen to be an usher?

[He considers this for a moment and then smiles]

  Chuck
I'm Chuck Bass.

[INT ST.JUDE'S HALLWAY - A teacher is walking past the waiting students and pins a list onto the noticeboard. The students then look at it, laugh and walk away. The teacher then walks away and Dan approaches the notice board. The list is entitled "Usher Assignments For Ivy Week". It shows that Chuck is the usher for Yale and Nate is the usher for Dartmouth. We then see that Dan is joined at the noticeboard by Nate]

  Nate
Hey.

  Dan
Hey.

  Nate
Did you get the one you wanted?

  Dan
No, no actually you did. Which makes total sense because I'm second in our class and you're somewhere, well I don't know, around last.

[Dan walks away from the notice board and picks up his school bag. Nate turns to him]

  Nate
No hard feelings, huh?

  Dan
Why should there be? I mean how many libraries has your dad had to endow to get you this spot? You've earned it.

  Nate
Look man, you don't know anything about my family.

  Dan
I'm sorry, you're right, you're right. I'm sure J.L Hall will be very impressed with your passion for the Dartmouth experience.

  Nate
Who the hell is J.L Hall?

  Dan
He's the Ivy rep! You might want to pick up his book if you want anything to talk about.

[Dan walks away and then turns back to Nate]

  Dan
The book's called "The Petting Zoo", that's the name of his book.

[Dan pushes open the door and storms outside. He is walking outside angrily and is approached by Serena who is walking down the stairs]

  Serena
Whoa! Angry guy, huh?

[Serena smiles and Dan laughs]

  Dan
Short fuse, I'm trying to work on that.

  Serena
Well, let me know how that goes for you.

[Dan stops walking and turns around to face Serena]

  Dan
Yeah, I'll keep you posted.

  Serena
It's a tough week.

  Dan
Not for me apparently.

  Serena
Oh! You got an usher position?

  Dan
No I didn't and in an ironic but not unexpected twist, Nate got the one I wanted.

  Serena
I'm sorry.

  Dan
Well I guess that's life when you're not a legacy.

  Serena
Well hey, just cos you're not an usher doesn't mean you're not going to get into an Ivy League.

  Dan
Yeah? Well where did your parents go to school?

  Serena
Harvard and Brown.

  Dan
That's all I'm saying.

[Dan turns to walk away and Serena makes a frustrated face]

[INT WALDORF HOME - Blair is lying on a chaise lounge whilst Kati and Isabel sit and press cold compresses onto her leg]

  Kati
I can't believe Serena did this.

  Isabel
Yeah, such a cheap shot.

[Blair's phone starts ringing, Blair looks at it and Kati and Isabel turn to face her. Blair answers the phone]

  Blair
Finally

[EXT NEW YORK]

[INT CHUCK'S LIMO - Chuck is sitting at the back of his limo and is on the phone to Blair]

  Chuck
Hello to you too, I heard about the field hockey throw down. All those mouth guards and short skirts, I hope somebody filmed it.

[INT WALDORF HOME - Blair is lying on the chaise lounge and has a disgusted look on her face. She scoffs at Chuck's remark]

  Blair
You're heinous

  Chuck (Voice Over)
That's probably why you called.

[Blair smiles at this]

  Blair
You know me well.

[INT CHUCK'S LIMO - Chuck is sitting at the back of his limo and is on the phone to Blair. He is staring out the limo window.]

  Chuck
Women like to pretend they're complicated, I know better.

[INT WALDORF HOME - Blair sets the phone on her shoulder]

  Blair
My leg's numb now, how about a heating pad?

  Isabel
Sure

  Kati
Okay

[Kati and Isabel stand up and start walking away. Blair rests the phone under her chin and then presses it back onto her ear. She swings her body around and stands up away from the Chaise Lounge]

  Blair
Serena came home for a reason.

[INT CHUCK'S LIMO - Chuck is sitting at the back of his limo and is on the phone to Blair]

  Chuck
One can only guess.

[INT WALDORF HOME - Blair is on the phone to Chuck and is walking to the edge of the room]

  Blair
Well I'm done guessing, I want answers and no one likes to be on the ground floor of a scandal like Chuck Bass.

[INT CHUCK'S LIMO - Chuck is sitting at the back of his limo and is on the phone to Blair]

  Chuck
I am a bitch when I wanna be.

[INT WALDORF HOME - Blair is leaning against the wall in her room and is smiling at Chuck's comment]

  Blair
Opportunity to cause some trouble, uncover a secret.

[INT CHUCK'S LIMO - Chuck is sitting at the back of his limo and is on the phone to Blair]

  Chuck
I say yes for an answer.

[INT WALDORF HOME - Blair smiles and hangs up the phone]

[INT CHUCK'S LIMO - Chuck hangs up his phone and opens the partition between him and his driver]

  Chuck
Let's turn back to school, I left something important inside.

[EXT NEW YORK - Chuck's limo drives down a street]

[INT HUMPHREY HOME - Rufus is standing and eating, Jenny is sitting at a laptop and Dan enters the house]

  Rufus
Oh Danny boy, how was your day?

  Jenny
He's about to hype dinner

  Rufus
Cos no matter how good it was, it's about to get better.

[Dan walks past Jenny and Rufus and enters his bedroom]

  Rufus
I've outdone myself with the bolognaise.

[Dan slams his bedroom door behind him. Rufus and Jenny look at each other and then Rufus walks into Dan's bedroom. Rufus walks over to Dan who is lying flat down in his bed]

  Dan
Sorry about the melodramatic entrance

  Rufus
You didn't get it?

  Dan
No I didn't get it.

  Rufus
And that I do not get.

[Dan turns his head into his pillow and starts screaming]

  Dan
They gave it to Nate Archibald!

  Dan
Last year I believe he had an original thought, it died of loneliness.

  Dan
I'm sorry.

  Rufus
You're sorry?

  Dan
Yeah I know how much you and mom have sacrificed. The whole reason you send us to a school like this is so that we can go to a college of our choice. What if it's all for nothing?

  Rufus
It's not okay, it's not. So you don't get to be the usher of some whatever party-

  Dan
Dad, can I just stew alone for awhile?

  Rufus
Yeah.

[Rufus turns and exits Dan's bedroom. He closes the door behind him and walks into the other room. He has a serious look on his face and looks at Jenny]

  Jenny
We're Humphrey's dad, not exactly royalty uptown.

  Rufus
You're okay with that?

[Jenny shakes her head]

  Jenny
No, but I'm used to it.

[EXT NEW YORK]

[EXT OSTROFF CENTRE - We see Serena walking down a street towards the Ostroff Centre. She is being followed by Chuck's limo. Serena walks into the Ostroff Centre, the limo stops outside it and Chuck rolls down his window]

  Chuck
This is way too good.

[Chuck takes out his phone and starts dialling]

[INT WALDORF HOME - LOUNGE - Nate is lying on the sofa reading "The Petting Zoo". Blair is sitting next to him reading "In Style", her phone rings and she sets down the magazine and answers her phone]

  Blair
Mom, how's Paris?

[EXT CHUCK'S LIMO - Chuck is looking out the window and is on the phone]

  Chuck
You won't believe where I found our little princess.

[INT WALDORF HOME - LOUNGE - Blair sitting upright and on the phone]

  Blair
Really?

[EXT NEW YORK]

[INT WALDORF HOME - BLAIR'S ROOM - We see a computer screen with pictures of Serena at the Ostroff Centre. We see that Chuck and Blair are looking at the computer screen]

  Chuck
Admit it; even for me this is good.

  Blair
If you weren't such a perv, I'm sure the CIA would hire you in a second.

  Chuck
Defending my country, there's a future I never imagined.

  Blair
With good reason, what is she doing there?

  Chuck
Well what's anyone doing there? It's a facility for the disturbed and addicted.

[Chuck walks away from Blair and she swivels around in her chair to face him]

  Blair
You must have your own wing.

[Chuck points at her and smiles]

  Chuck
You don't get nearly enough credit for your wit.

[Blair smiles at him]

  Chuck
So the question is what do you do now?

  Blair
Oh, I was thinking total social destruction.

[Blair stands out of her chair and walks closer to Chuck. Chuck smiles.]

  Chuck
And here I thought you were getting soft.

[Blair grins at Chuck. Chuck picks up part of Blair's blanket]

  Chuck
So this is your bed, huh?

[Blair gives Chuck a dirty look and then snatches the blanket away from him]

  Blair
Leaving now.

  Chuck
You can repay me another time.

[Chuck looks at Blair and then walks out of her bedroom. Blair smiles and walks towards the computer, she sits down at the chair and stares at the screen]

[INT OSTROFF CENTRE - ERIK'S ROOM - Serena, Erik and Lily sit in chairs opposite Erik's councillor]

  Serena
I've been in these sessions everyday for the last week but nothing is going to change unless she stops hiding him here and lets him have his life back.

  Lily
This is not called hiding Serena, it's called recovery.

  Serena
Telling everyone he's staying with Aunt Carol in Miami?

  Lily
He's not ready.

  Serena
He's not or your not?

  Councillor
Okay let's take a deep breath. It's good to see honest conversation.

[Serena points to Lily]

  Serena
What does she know about honesty?

  Lily
Serena-

  Councillor
But I really think a decision like this includes Erik as well.

  Erik
You mean I have a say in this? Wow, thanks.

  Lily
Erik, look of course we're here for you.

[Serena grabs Erik's arm]

  Serena
Look if you're ready to leave, you tell us, okay? No matter what mom says.

[Erik turns to councillor]

  Erik
I would really like to get out of here.

[Lily sighs and puts her hand in front of her face. Erik turns and looks at her]

  Erik
But maybe I'm not ready yet.

[Lily drops her hand from her face and immediately relaxes. Serena turns to Erik and lays her hands on him.]

  Serena
Hey, what about for a few hours? You can be my date for the Ivy Week party tonight.

  Lily
Serena, that party is an important event for you.

  Serena
Well he'll be around people he knows; it'll be fun, comfortable.

  Erik
Actually that sounds great.

  Councillor
Well there we go, compromise. That wasn't so hard was it?

[Serena and Erik both smile whilst Lily has a serious look on her face]

  Lily
You know what, I have to go help them set up for tonight at the school. It's my job as both parent committee chair and responsible mother.

[Lily stands up and leaves the room. Serena and Erik smile at each other.

  Serena
It'll be great, okay?

[EXT ST. JUDE'S SCHOOL FOR BOYS]

[INT ST. JUDE'S - We see people walking down a corridor carrying chairs to prepare for the Ivy mixer. Rufus walks down the corridor and looks around. He walks over to the stairs and spots a female assistant]

  Rufus
Hi! How are you?

[Rufus runs up the stairs to meet the assistant]

  Female Assistant
Good

  Rufus
Rufus Humphrey

[Rufus meets the assistant at the stairs and they start to walk down them together]

  Rufus
My kid Dan goes to St. Jude's and he really should've been selected as Dartmouth's usher, maybe there was a mix up? Some kind of a glitch in the system? I'd like to believe that because I like to believe the best in people.

[They both stop at the bottom of the stairs]

  Female Assistant
I'm sorry Mr Humphrey but the usher positions have all been filled, there's nothing we can do.

[Female Assistant turns away from Rufus and starts to walk down the corridor away from him. Rufus also turns and walks along side with her. He stops walking and stands in front of her.]

  Rufus
Is there anything else? Any other positions?

  Female Assistant
Ahh, you'll have to discuss this with our committee chairwoman.

  Rufus
Sure, perfect I'd love to, where can I find her?

  Female Assistant
Not sure, she must be running late.

[We see that behind Rufus, Lily is approaching the doorway and is talking animatedly with someone]

  Female Assistant
Oh, there she is now.

[Rufus turns around to look, he sees Lily and smiles. He then turns back to the assistant]

  Rufus
Why am I not surprised?

  Female Assistant
Lucky for you, she seems to be in a good mood.

  Rufus
Until she sees me.

[Rufus turns away from the assistant and faces the doorway. Lily is smiling and walking through the doorway. Her smile drops when she sees Rufus]

  Lily
Rufus

  Rufus
Told ya.

  Female Assistant
Excuse me.

[The assistant turns left and walks away from Lily and Rufus]

  Rufus
You got a minute Lil?

  Lily
Not for you

[Lily turns away from Rufus and starts to walk up the staircase. Rufus turns to follow after her]

[EXT NEW YORK]

[INT HUMPHREY HOME -LOUNGE- Jenny and Dan are both sitting on the sofa. Dan is reading "The Petting Zoo" and Jenny is sewing a garment of clothing. The camera cuts to the door and Rufus walks through it carrying some leaflets. He smiles broadly and closes the door behind him]

  Rufus
You're in.

[Dan turns to look at Rufus]

  Dan
What?

[Rufus walks over to a desk in front of where Dan and Jenny are sitting. He stops and looks at the leaflets]

  Rufus
The Ivy Week party tonight, your name will be on the programme and everything.

[Dan closes his book and Jenny looks up in shock. Dan throws his book on the table and Jenny drops the garment. They both stand up and walk towards Rufus]

  Dan
You got me the Dartmouth spot!

  Jenny
I knew you could do it dad.

  Rufus
No you didn't and no I didn't. How do you feel about the refreshment committee?

  Dan
Well there is no refreshment committee.

  Rufus
Not until now.

  Jenny
Oh God.

  Rufus
What? Everybody gets thirsty; it's really a position of power.

  Dan
How did you secure me this prominent and simultaneously embarrassing position?

[Rufus sits down at a chair by the desk and leaves through the leaflets]

  Rufus
By offering my own services.

  Dan
You're serving snacks?

  Rufus
I'm the head of the entertainment committee.

[Dan laughs and walks back to the sofa. He picks up his book and sits down.

  Dan
Another committee that didn't exist until you left the house today.

  Jenny
Way to go dad! Wait so who's the entertainment?

  Rufus
Since it was such short notice the only person I could get was myself.

  Dan
Kind of a stayed affair for early nineties post punk mass rock, don't ya think?

  Rufus
I'm bringing a couple of the guys, it'll be Rufus unplugged.

[We see Jenny has now joined Dan on the sofa and has the garment and sewing needle back in her hand]

  Jenny
Need a roadie?

  Rufus
Thanks sweetie.

  Dan
Should I call mom and we could make this a fully fledged Humphrey affair?

[Dan smiles sarcastically and Rufus sits down opposite them]

  Rufus
Look, I did the best I could. At least you get to officially be a part of this thing. You can talk to that author you love. Ask him anything you want.

  Dan
Like his preference for soft drinks?

[EXT NEW YORK]

[EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST. JUDE'S - We see Erik, Serena and Lily exiting a black car. A chauffeur is holding the door open for them. Lily turns to Erik]

  Lily
If you get at all anxious sweetie, if you feel light headed or panicky-

  Erik
I'll be fine mom. All I have to do is be normal.

[Lily walks ahead leaving behind Erik and Serena]

  Erik
Or at least act normal.

  Serena
Works for mom.

[They both smile and walk through the gates together]

[EXT CONSTANCE BILLAR/ST. JUDE'S - A party is taking place outdoors and people are mingling. We hear gentle acoustic music and we see Rufus and other band member playing various different instruments. Dan is smiling and serving a drink for someone. Blair is talking to a Yale representative whilst nearby Nate and Chuck are laughing and talking to each other. We see Serena, Lily and Erik walk into the party together. They stop and Blair and Dan both turn to look at them. Serena turns to Lily]

  Serena
Do you see the Yale rep?

  Lily
I thought you wanted to go to Brown and Blair wanted to go to Yale?

[They start walking into the party again]

  Serena
Yeah, I know.

[We see Rufus and his band playing again and the camera turns to show Blair talking to the Yale rep]

  Blair
My father would never forgive me if I didn't introduce myself. He said that you two used to be CRU together.

[The Yale rep starts to respond but is interrupted by Serena coming up besides them]

  Serena
CRU?

[Serena turns to the Yale rep and extends her hand for him to shake]

  Serena
Oh hi, I'm Serena Van Der Woodsen.

[The Yale rep shakes her hand and Serena smiles broadly. Serena turns to Blair.]

  Serena
Blair, I didn't know that you are interested in joining CRU.

[Blair turns to Serena with an angry look on her face]

  Blair
I'm not! I was just saying that there's a family connection because of my father-

  Serena
-Because I didn't think you were interested in athletics at all. Well especially ones where you might get your hair wet.

[Serena grabs Blair and starts stroking her arm. Serena smiles towards the Yale rep]

  Serena
She's really more of an indoors type of girl.

[Serena signals towards the Yale rep's glass]

  Serena
Oh my goodness your glass is nearly empty. Let's get you a drink.

[Serena reaches for the Yale rep's arm and moves to lead him away from Blair. Blair moves to try and block her]

  Blair
Uh, no I'll take him.

[Serena pats Blair's arm]

  Serena
Oh, don't worry about it.

[Serena grabs the Yale rep's arm and leads him away]

  Serena
So, tell me about Yale.

[The camera turns to show Blair left behind. She is visibly upset and scowls in Serena's direction. She walks over to Chuck who is gazing into the distance]

  Blair
Can you please explain why Serena is commandeering the Yale rep whilst you're supposed to be his usher?

[Chuck turns to her and then returns his gaze to where he was previously staring]

  Chuck
I switched.

[The camera turns to show what Chuck was staring at. We see that it's an older woman who is a representative for Princeton. She is sending flirtatious glances to Chuck]

  Chuck
I'm trying to get into Princeton.

[Blair stares at him in an annoyed way. Chuck turns to return the stare and Blair looks away]

  Chuck
Oh don't get your La Perla's into a bunch.

[Blair rolls her eyes at his comment and Chuck grabs her arm and steers her into a different direction]

  Chuck
Look who's arrived.

[Chuck and Blair start walking and the camera turns to show Dr. Ostroff entering. Chuck turns to address him]

  Chuck
Dr Ostroff! Blair, Doctor Donald Ostroff.

[Blair realises what's happening and smiles. She shakes hands with Dr. Ostroff]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Interesting choice of guests B.

  Blair
It's such a pleasure; I've heard such wonderful things-

[Blair smiles at Dr. Ostroff and grabs his arm and leads him away. The camera turns to show Chuck smiling at Blair]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Coincidence? I think not.

[We see various shots of the party. Dan is pouring a drink for someone and we then see Nate talking to J.L Hall]

  Nate
I like your book.

  J.L Hall
Oh thanks, what did you think of the epilogue?

[Nate struggles to think of someone to say and stays silent for a moment]

  J.L Hall
Some people really love it but New York Times called it a cheap cop out. Warner Brothers is making the movie; I think they're going to change the end.

  Nate
I can see how the ending wouldn't seem all that... commercial.

[J.L Hall nods his head and doesn't know what to say to Nate's vague comment. Nate looks uncomfortable]

  Nate
Umm... Would you like something to drink?

[We now see Lily and Erik standing together. Bart is behind Erik and is approaching them]

  Bart
Lily! Hello

  Lily
Oh Bart, hello how are you?

[Bart leans towards Lily and they both kiss each other on both cheeks. Bart then leans away and turns towards Erik]

  Bart
Hey Erik! How was Miami?

[Erik looks uncomfortable and looks to Lily for reassurance. He turns back to Bart and smiles fakely]

  Erik
It was good thanks. Y'know go Marlins!

[Erik raises his fist to the air]

[Bart and Lily both laugh politely]

  Erik
Would you excuse me please?

[Erik walks away from them both and into the main building. As he enters it we see Kati and Isabel leaving it and talking to a male representative. They are both dressed smartly in matching outfits and they're both wearing glasses.]

  Kati
So the Neurons project I'm working on involves a cellular pathway of Neural Oxide. It's initiated when-

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST JUDE'S - We see Erik standing alone and Jenny is walking towards him from behind. Jenny is wearing the Blue dress that Blair gave to her. Erik turns around and they both spot each other. Jenny smiles and gives him a small smile. Jenny carries on walking and Erik starts walking to meet her ]

  Jenny
Hi! You're Erik, right?

  Erik
You're Jenny, Dan's sister.

  Jenny
Yeah! We met at-

  Erik
-Bendels. Yeah I remember.

[They both smile at each other and don't notice Howie Archibald walking up towards Erik]

  Jenny
Cool!

[Howie reaches them]

  Howie
Erik! Good to see you. You enjoy Miami?

[Howie and Erik shake hands]

  Erik
Ah... yeah! Save the manatees!

[Howie smiles and points towards Erik. He then turns and walks away, leaving Jenny and Erik alone again]

  Jenny
Manatees?

  Erik
It's a long story.

  Jenny
I've got time.

  Erik
It's a little dark.

  Jenny
I can handle it.

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST.JUDE'S - It's a transparent glass room and Dan and Serena are standing together. Dan is at a table next to the punch bowl and Serena is opposite him]

  Dan
You wanna go to Yale then?

  Serena
No, Brown. It's just this thing with Blair.

  Dan
I get it, since you don't actually have to worry about getting into college, why not make the entire evening about screwing over Blair.

[Serena looks upset by Dan's words and Nate enters the room and walks towards them. Dan offers Serena some punch]

  Serena
No thanks.

[Nate reaches the table and picks up a cup. Serena turns towards him]

  Serena
Hey.

[Nate avoids Serena's gaze and sighs. Serena looks hurt by Nate's reaction to her]

  Serena
Wait, you're seriously not going to talk to me? Like literally not speak?

[Nate sighs again and then turns towards Serena]

  Nate
Hey

[Nate then turns back towards the table. Serena is annoyed by the way that Nate is acting]

  Serena
Oh! Much better.

[Serena looks between both Dan and Nate]

  Serena
Thanks guys.

[Serena turns and walks away. Both Dan and Nate give Serena little reaction]

  Dan
So what's he like?

  Nate
Like a Dartmouth English lit professor that I have nothing in common with.

[Dan nods and looks upset]

  Nate
I guess I could tell him how I'm an Archibald.

[Dan and Nate both smile at Nate's remark]

  Dan
You should mention Dr. Seuss. Theo Giselle was his real name, he went to Dartmouth. Hall says he got the idea for "The Petting Zoo" from the Lorex.

[Nate looks really confused]

  Nate
The what?

  Dan
Umm... you know what never mind. Just mention how his prostyle is influenced by early Faulkner and you'll be alright. Ah, or not.

  Nate
I was actually going to get some fresh air, how about you take these over to him?

[Nate passes two glasses over to Dan. Dan looks shocked by Nate's gesture]

  Dan
Alright, yeah I guess he can read my post essay for "Petting Zoo".

[Dan walks away from Nate, leaving him standing by the refreshment stand. Dan nods towards Nate to thank him for the kind gesture. We see Dan leave the room and approach J.L Hall's table, Dan introduces himself and offers him the drink. J.L Hall stands and shakes hands with Dan; the camera moves to show Nate at the refreshment stand looking upset. Nate turns and walks away past his father, Howie stands and looks from Nate to Dan entertaining J.L Hall outside. Howie runs after Nate and stops him by grabbing his arm roughly.

  Howie
Where do you think you're going?

  Nate
Home

  Howie
I don't think so, now you get back out there and finish what you started.

  Nate
You mean you started. I don't want to go to Dartmouth, there I said it. Now back off!

[Nate turns and angrily walks away leaving Howie behind]

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST. JUDE'S - Erik and Jenny are sitting on the floor opposite each other in mirroring positions]

  Erik
So, we moved into a hotel and it was just the two of us and I was really lonely.

[Erik looks upset and Jenny is looking at him sympathetically]

  Jenny
So, that's when you?

[Erik nods to signal yes]

  Erik
So I ended up at the Ostroff centre and my mom says that they're the best councillors but what they really get paid for is to keep their mouth's shut.

[Jenny looks really upset]

  Jenny
Look, I won't say anything. I promise.

[Erik nods and they both smile sadly at each other]

  Jenny
So... do you wanna go back in?

  Erik
Yeah and answer more questions about Florida?

  Jenny
I have a grandma that lives in Fort Myers. I can help think of some material.

[Erik smiles in thanks. Erik stands up and then offers Jenny a hand to help her get up. Jenny stands and then they both turn to exit the room]

[EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST. JUDE'S - There is a swarm of people gathered. Blair stands up on stage]

  Blair
Can I please have everyone's attention?

[We cut to see Kati, Isabel and Chuck standing together. They turn to look at Blair and look curious to see what she's going to say. Dan and J.L Hall stand and look at Blair. Serena stops talking and turns to pay attention to Blair with a look of disgust on her face]

  Blair
Welcome again to the Constance Billard/ St. Jude's Ivy mixer. I'm Blair Waldorf, chair of the community outreach committee.

[We see everyone clapping including Chuck, Dan, Lily, Erik and Jenny. Serena is the only person who is refusing to clap. Blair smiles at her applause.]

  Blair
Every year our schools choose to support one local institution that we feel benefits our community. This year our schools have chosen to honour the Ostroff Centre.

[Serena stops talking to a teenage boy and starts to pay attention to Blair's speech. She starts to realise what Blair is doing and Erik and Jenny both look upset at the mention of the Ostroff Centre. Lily looks shocked and Serena walks over to Erik and comforts him.]

  Blair
This year's choice is a very personal one because the centre has helped one of our own.

[Erik and Serena are now next to Lily. Lily has a look of panic on her face and turns to them]

  Lily
What's going on?

[Erik and Serena shake their heads to signal that they are unsure. They all return their attention to Blair on the stage]

  Blair
It's because of their excellent programme which aids so many young addicts and alcoholics, that a student here with us today is clean and sober... at least for now. Can I please have Serena Van Der Woodsen join me on stage?

[Blair smiles and we see in the crowd that Dan turns to look at Serena. Serena meanwhile is in a state of shock. Everyone in the crowd is very surprised and concerned by what is going on; apart from Chuck who is extremely happy and smiling widely at Blair. Blair smiles back at Chuck and then gives a dirty look to Serena. Serena looks on the verge of tears and has to look away from Blair. Serena is standing with Lily and Erik; Lily turns to Serena]

  Lily
Tell me this isn't happening.

[Erik looks very angry and is about to walk towards the stage in order to stop Blair]

  Erik
It's not.

[Serena and Lily both hold back Erik and prevent him from going to the stage. Serena turns to Erik]

  Serena
No, you're not going up there. You're going to stand right here, okay?

  Lily
Whatever you're doing, think about who's standing in this room right now.

[Serena shakes her head at Lily. She then turns and walks towards the stage to meet Blair. The people in the room watch her action including Dan and Jenny. Serena stands next to Blair on stage.]

  Blair
Don't try to deny it, Chuck saw you.

[Blair steps behind Serena so that she has the full focus of the crowd's attention. Blair leads the crowd into a round of applause for Serena. Dan watches what's happening with an upset look on his face. Serena waves to the crowd]

  Serena
Hi, I'm Serena Van Der Woodsen. I just wanna thank my friend-

[Serena turns towards Blair who is smiling at her]

  Serena
-Blair Waldorf for recognising the Ostroff Centre and all of the good things that they do.

[We see Chuck smirking and incredibly pleased by Serena's humiliation]

  Serena
Thanks Blair.

[Serena turns towards Blair and starts clapping. Blair and the rest of the cloud join in with the applause. Erik looks really hurt by his sister's pain on stage]

  Serena
In the Ostroff Centre, one of the main things that we learn is forgiveness-

[Dan looks confused and turns towards Jenny]

  Dan
She's in rehab?

  Jenny
No, it's her brother who's there.

  Dan
What?

  Jenny
You can't tell anyone, alright?

  Dan
I won't but why is she doing this?

[Dan turns his attention back to Serena on stage]

  Serena
In order to move forward for our future, we must forgive those who have wronged us in the past.

[Serena mildly turns her head in Blair's direction and Blair nods her head at Serena's speech]

  Serena
And we ourselves must ask for forgiveness from those whom we've wronged.

[Serena is now very clearly looking at Blair. Blair looks uncomfortable and the crowd applaud at what Serena is saying]

  Serena
Without this forgiveness, innocent people get hurt-

[Blair can no longer listen to the speech, so she walks over to Serena and grabs her arm to stop her talking]

  Blair
Thank you Serena! Thank you! Thank you!

[Blair claps on stage with a large smile on her face. She moves Serena out of the way of the audience's focus]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Honesty may the best policy in some zip codes but not in this one and not this week cos "I Was a Teenage Drug Addict" is not exactly a winning college essay.

[Many people in the crowd including Dan look at Serena with remorseful faces. Blair and Serena square off on stage and then Serena walks off the stage and exits the room. Lily follows her out. The camera returns back to Blair who still is in her spot on stage]

  Blair
Can we now have Dr. Ostroff join me on stage?

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST.JUDE'S - Serena is standing in the room in tears. Lily is walking into the room to talk to her]

  Lily
Why is Blair outing you for a drug problem that you don't have?

[Serena starts walking away from her and Lily follows]

  Lily
You don't, do you?

[Serena stops walking and turns around to face Lily]

  Serena
Mom!

  Lily
Well, it's not like we have some free open relationship-

[Serena is now enraged]

  Serena
-and that's my fault!

  Lily
Look, what's happened to Erik has put a huge strain on our family but we are still a family.

  Serena
Why do you think I did what I just did?

[Lily nods sadly at Serena]

  Serena
Will you excuse me? I'm gonna go end this with Blair... now.

[Serena turns and walks out of the room away from Lily. We see that Lily is very upset and annoyed by what's happened]

[EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST.JUDE'S - We see Serena stepping out of the room and outside where the party is occurring. Serena approaches Blair who is standing and talking with the Yale representative]

  Serena
Blair, what the hell was that?

[Blair turns to the Yale Representative]

  Blair
Will you excuse us please?

  Yale Rep
Sure

[Blair walks away and is followed by Serena. The Yale Rep looks at them and is clearly confused by what's going on. Blair stops walking and turns to face Serena]

  Serena
So we good now? We square?

  Blair
No! Because nothing I do can ever be as bad as what you did to me.

[Serena looks on the verge of tears]

  Serena
Look, I'm asking you please, I'll stop if you will.

  Blair
You're just saying that because you lost and you're gonna keep losing. Now if you'll excuse me, unlike you I have a future to get back to.

[Blair walks away, leaving behind a distraught Serena. Serena composes herself and then also walks away in the same direction that Blair did. Dan watches her walk away and chooses to follow her]

[EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST.JUDE'S - COURTYARD - Serena is marching out of the school grounds and is being followed by Dan]

  Dan
Serena!

[Serena carries on walking and ignores his call]

  Dan
Serena!

[Serena angrily turns around to face him]

  Serena
What? What do you want to congratulate me on destroying my future?

  Dan
No. I just wanted to ask if you are okay, cos what you did in there for your brother. It was really cool.

  Serena
Wait, how did you know that it was my brother?

  Dan
It's okay; really no one will ever hear it from me.

[Dan puts his hand on his heart]

  Dan
But if you ever need somebody to talk to or not talk to. I'd be happy to go out with you.

  Serena
I'll keep that in mind.

  Dan
And I know I said some things about you and your world and I'm sorry. Obviously I don't know anything about your life.

[Serena smiles at Dan]

  Serena
Thank you but I really need to get out of here.

  Dan
Yeah. Sure. Sure.

  Serena
But maybe I can take you up on that getting together and not talking thing sometime.

  Serena
Will you call me?

[Dan smiles and nods]

  Dan
Yeah

[Serena smiles at him and then mouths bye to Dan. She turns and walks away, leaving Dan smiling at her with a large smile]

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST.JUDE'S - Erik is standing in the transparent glass room. Lily walks up and approaches him]

  Lily
Okay let's go, let's get out of here.

[Lily gently puts her hand on Erik's arm]

  Erik
No, there's someone I need to talk to first.

  Erik
Please mom, I can do this.

  Lily
Okay

[Erik walks away from Lily and approaches Blair.]

  Erik
Blair, can I talk to you? It will just take a minute.

  Blair
Sure!

[Blair smiles and walks away with Erik. She leaves behind Kati and Isabel whom she had previously been speaking with. Lily turns and watches them leave the room]

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST.JUDE'S - Blair and Erik have now entered a different room. Erik is leading the way and Blair is following behind him. Erik stops walking and turns around to face Blair]

  Erik
Serena's not a patient at the Ostroff Centre-

  Blair
-Erik, you've always been a sweet kid and I understand you trying to protect your sister.

  Erik
I am.

[Blair smiles at this announcement]

  Blair
I've never even seen you take a drink.

  Erik
I'm not an alcoholic. I did this!

[Erik pulls up his sleeve to show Blair a large scar on his wrist. Blair's face falls as she looks at the scar and realises what she's done]

  Erik
And today Serena protected me.

[Blair can't look Erik in the eye and seems to be lost for words]

  Blair
Erik...I...I didn't-

  Erik
-See that coming. Well that must be a shock for someone who thinks she knows everything.

[Blair looks on the verge of tears and Erik walks past Blair and out of the room. As he exits the room, Chuck enters it and starts to walk up to Blair from behind]

  Chuck
What was that all about?

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Another bomb lands in Blair's lap. Will she use it as ammunition or will she finally surrender and put down her arms?

[Blair is nearly in tears and is trying to compose herself. Chuck is looking at her with a mixture of both curiosity and concern. Blair swallows a lump in her throat]

  Blair
Nothing.

[EXT NEW YORK]

[INT HUMPHREY HOME - KITCHEN - We see a close up of Dan's copy of "The Petting Zoo". On the opening page we see a written message from J.L Hall saying "To Dan. Hope to see you in two years". The camera zooms out to show that Rufus is the one reading the message in the book whilst Dan sits at the counter drinking some coffee and reading a magazine]

  Rufus
So you really impressed the guy, huh?

[Rufus walks past Dan and around to the other side of the counter. He is now directly facing Dan and he sets the copy of "The Petting Zoo" down.]

  Rufus
Must be the way you poured those sodas.

[Rufus turns around and pours himself a cup of coffee]

  Dan
Yeah about that, uh, I know I may have been a little light with the gratitude.

  Rufus
Yeah, a touch.

[Rufus turns around with his cup of coffee and looks at Dan]

  Dan
But I appreciate it, all of it. Even if I sometimes don't show it.

  Rufus
We're real men son; we don't like to share our feelings.

[Dan smiles at this remark and picks up his cup of coffee.]

  Rufus
But I know what you're capable of and nothing; my last name, my bank account, is going to stop you from getting what you deserve. Not if I can help it.

[Dan looks at his father and appreciates what he's saying to him]

  Rufus
And I see that Dartmouth has an electro acoustic music programme, what do you think of me applying?

[Dan leans and reads what Rufus is talking about in one of his magazines]

  Dan
What?

  Rufus
And Jenny's smart; we can get her early admission and maybe we'll all go.

  Dan
So not remotely funny.

[Dan and Rufus both smile at each other]

[INT PALACE HOTEL - CHUCK'S SUITE - We see that Nate's phone is ringing on a table. There is a trail of clothes spread over the floor and Chuck is lying sleeping in bed. The ringing of the phone awakens Chuck and he throws a pillow at Nate so that he will answer it. We see that Nate is asleep on Chuck's sofa and is half dressed. The pillow hits the ground near Nate and he wakes up. Nate looks at the phone and picks it up. He reads the Caller ID and sighs, he then answers it]

  Nate
Hello?

[Nate sits upright with his eyes closed and listens to the caller]

  Nate
Oh yeah, I'll be right there.

[Nate ends the call and then returns the phone to the table that it was previously sitting on. The camera moves to show Chuck now awake in bed]

  Chuck
Where the hell could you possibly have to be right now?

  Nate
I'm late for a run with my dad.

[Nate reaches for a napkin that is sitting on the table in front of him. He reads what is on it and then turns to Chuck]

  Nate
Who's Jessica?

[Chuck is now smiling smugly at the mention of the name]

  Chuck
Jersey girls.

[Nate stands up and pulls his vest on]

  Chuck
Let's just say they're the Princeton tigers for a reason.

[Nate laughs at Chuck's remark. He then picks up his phone from the table]

  Nate
Alright, I'll see ya.

[Nate walks out of the room and Chuck gives him a small wave from his bed]

[EXT CENTRAL PARK - Nate is walking up some stairs and is met up the top by Howie and J.L Hall]

  Howie
Hey, good to see ya son!

[Howie signals towards J.L Hall]

  Howie
Turns out Jeff's a runner too.

  J.L Hall
I would never have mentioned it if I knew he'd have me out here this early.

[J.L Hall leans forward and shakes hands with Nate]

  J.L Hall
I'm glad to see you're feeling better.

  Howie
Nate, I was just telling Jeff about your little bout of food poisoning last night.

[Nate looks at his father with a confused expression on his face]

  Howie
What do you say kiddo? Wanna show him how it's done?

  Nate
Let's go.

[Howie turns to J.L Hall]

  Howie
Nate is the captain of his Lacrosse team as well as being an All Star Cross Country runner.

[Howie nudges J.L Hall on the arm and they begin to run out of shot together. Nate is left standing, confused by his father's actions. Nate then walks after them]

[INT OSTROFF CENTRE - ERIK'S ROOM - Erik is sitting on the floor playing solitaire on his laptop. His door is left open and we see Jenny walk up to it. Jenny knocks on the door and Erik sees her and smiles. He closes the lid on his laptop and stands up and walks over to Jenny]

  Jenny
Hey!

  Erik
Hey!

  Jenny
Is it okay that I'm here?

  Erik
Yeah! Hi!

  Jenny
Ah, will your mom be mad?

  Erik
That you're here? Well that would require her stopping by.

[Jenny looks confused by this]

  Erik
Saturday morning's are spent at Bliss. After last night I think that she could do with some extra time on the massage table.

[Jenny nods in understanding]

  Jenny
Well... here

[Jenny hands a gift over to Erik. She turns right and sees a large bouquet of flowers]

  Jenny
Somebody has an admirer.

  Erik
They're for my sister.

[Jenny looks confused]

  Erik
From the Brown rep; apparently his cousin did some time here in his youth.

  Jenny
Well that's good! At least her whole future isn't totally blown.

  Erik
I don't think that's making her feel a whole lot better right now.

[Jenny nods in understanding]

[EXT NEW YORK]

[EXT CENTRAL PARK - It's raining and Serena is sheltered in a secluded spot. She is alone and lying on a bench reading a book. Blair walks up to her and Serena looks up]

  Blair
Whenever something's bothering you, I can always find you here.

[Serena sets her book down. She then stands upright and faces Blair]

  Serena
You here for another catfight?

[Blair opens her clutch and removes an envelope from it. She closes her clutch and Serena stares at the envelope]

  Serena
What's that?

  Blair
A letter; I wrote it to you when you were away at boarding school.

[Serena gives Blair a fed up look]

  Blair
I never sent it.

[Blair looks down at the letter and starts reading from it]

  Blair
Dear Serena, my world is falling apart and you're the only one who would understand. My father left my mother for a 31 year old model; a male model. I feel like screaming because I don't have anyone to talk to.

[Serena looks at Blair sympathetically]

  Blair
You're gone. My dad's gone. Nate's acting weird. Where are you? Why don't you call? Why did you leave without saying goodbye?

[Blair and Serena are now both at the verge of tears]

  Blair
You're supposed to be my best friend. I miss you so much. Love Blair.

[Blair now stops reading from the letter and puts it back inside the envelope. She looks up at Serena]

  Serena
Why didn't you send it? I could've-

  Blair
-You could've what!

[Blair is now choked up with tears and her voice is breaking]

  Blair
You knew Serena and you didn't even call.

  Serena
I didn't know what to say to you. I didn't know how to be your friend after what I did. I'm so sorry.

  Blair
Erik told me what happened; I guess your family's been going through a hard time too.

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Spotted in Central Park: Two white flags waving. Could an Upper East Side peace accord be far off?

[Blair and Serena both smile at each other]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
So what will it be? Truce or consequences? We all know one nation can't have two queens. What happens next? Only time will tell. XOXO Gossip Girl.

[The camera zooms out to show both Blair and Serena staring at each other]

      END OF EPISODE




  Safety Officer
Sorry, you're not on the list.

  Blair
Of course you do! This is my dream!

  Security guard
Not anymore.

  Gossip Girl
Hi, the Upper East Siders. There's nothing Gossip Girl likes more than surprises. And we see the 2 in 1 formula enjoyed Blair Waldorf: his mother Eleanor who has just returned from Paris and Serena Van Der Woodsen lunching with girlfriends.

  Serena
Hey! You're standing.

  Blair
We had something planned?

  Eleanor
Honey, it's rude to interrupt. I just said to Serena, that Bendel is interrested by the shelving of my line.

  Blair
Really? It's great! Why did not you say anything?

  Eleanor
I returned to Paris early enough to meet my book and if they like what they see, it could be the beginning of a complete collection "lifestyle".

  Blair
Because more people should be like you mom.

  Eleanor
Before biting in there, you ought to interresser yogurt 0%.

  Blair
I lost a pound during your absence ...

  Eleanor
And you are wonderful.

  Serena
They are beautiful, Ms. Waldorf.

  Eleanor
Well, they will be if they are not offended by the trip. Honey, please. Serena comes back later when everything is unpacked. I'd love to have your opinion. You have a beautiful style, good for you.

  Serena
Thank you, but it will not be possible. Blair and I have plans today.

  Bair
A good?

  Gossip Girl
Serena and Blair may have projects today, but Nate and Chuck are overbooks for all weekend ... if they survive.

  Chuck
From Piaget.

  Nate
You can not call it a watch?

  Chuck
If it costs more than 10 bricks, it deserves its own name.

  Nate
And that?

  Chuck
Especially that. The ball Babe Ruth, the best that have ever typed for a home run. Better safe than sorry. Here we go! You survived the week and Ivy have fortunately gained entry to a tiquet the school of your choice. Now, ruining the chance. Let me remind you the rules. From now, the only outside world is the one I showed you, you eat what I give you and you do what I tell you, and until further notice the only girls whom you speak are the ones I paid. The weekend of debauchery begin!

  Man
One, two, three, two!

  Chuck
Who brought the yeti?

  Nate
It's not Carter Baizen? I have not seen him since he was last year and in the fifth. He looks serious.

  Chuck
Are you high? Looks like Matthew Mcconaughey between movies, it's a loser. Listen, someone who changes his investment fund for a fanny-pack is shattered all that is holy to Chuck Bass.

  Carter
Nate Archibald, is that you?

  Nate
Baizen, buddy! I heard that you had become a rogue!

  Carter
And I'm here to talk about it.

  Gossip Girl
It looks like someone did not anticipate the intruder. Chuck does not he know that a party is not one until someone is there is not embedded?

  Blair
My god, I forgot what it was like to be with you.

  Serena
No, they looked at us both.

  Blair
You crazy not me, it was like that all morning, starting with your charming visit my mother. She has not even called to say she was returning.

  Serena
She was busy. She hurried back and everything. Because she wanted to see you.

  Blair
She did not even awake.

  Serena
You know what Eleanor thought of sleep to be beautiful.

  Blair
She loves you more than me.

  Serena
This is not true, you are her daughter, she loves no one but you. It's just ... she does not know how to show it sometimes.

  Blair
Okay, I'm inside, wait for me. I come back. Serena Humphrey! Dan! Hello!

  Dan
Hi!

  Serena
Oh my god, that's what I love about this city, you fall always full of people. What are you doing here?

  Dan
I'm back from my mother after having filed in Hudson Jenny. I took two Cuban for me and my father ... sandwiches, not cigars!

  Serena
Do you remember saying you could meet one day and ... not to speak? I wondered if this "day" is happened?

  Blair
It was disgusting. The head should be closed.

  Serena
The toilets?

  Blair
No, all people ... it's called Nolita, not "no shower". What are you doing here? It smells like pork? And cheese? Ok, as soon as you finished with your charity why not join me? I would have to Tory Burch to look for ponchos.

  Dan
It's not the girl who said to the whole school and several universities that you had a drug problem?

Serena
  Yeah. But you know, Blair may be a little Blair.

  Dan
Yeah, yeah.

Serena
  We're actually trying to work things out. Today is our first day hanging out together... alone. So I should probably get back.

  Dan
Yeah, of course, is ...

  Serena
Yes. But call me one of these days so we can get together and do stuff you do not ask me to do.

  Nate
I do not understand, the last time I saw your sister she said that you had turned your family and you wandered the earth's surface.

  Carter
No, I just wandered in their own area. Once embezzled money, you see that it does not buy freedom but rather a prison. They said I had gone but I just escaped.

  Nate
You went where?

  Carter
Where? I helped clean up after Katrina, spent a year rebuilding Machu Picchu, which, let me tell you, my life has changed. I bought a digital camera and filmed for a documentary.

  Chuck
You're the guy who gave us our first joint, first brought to our club and you will tell me that the life of director for Youtube is better than that? You've invented the weekend of debauchery.

  Nate
Who interress at a party when you can travel?

  Carter
Exactly, in the real world, the only thing that matters is what you are and not what you possess.

  Chuck
Well I love this speech on non-material need a guy who has as much product in his hair, this festival is about the excess, not the phisolophie. Stop talking. Let's party. Now this is something that requires nothing material. Indeed, this is about to be removed. Who's with me?

  Nate
I think I'll stay here a little bit.

  Chuck
Well. I would have hated to destroy such a beautiful meeting anyway.

  Carter
If we went around a few cards? That sh1t for the kids, texas hold'em died. I'll show you the real action. You know what? I am part of the weekly game in this borough of Queens, it lasts all night. This is the real game: high stakes, big money, people with stories that would raise mine for anything. You... you should come.

  Nate
Yeah?

  Carter
Yeah

  Laurel
It missed its entry in the parade of Chloe, because she was vomiting a pear. She made the cover of vogue Vera.

  Eleanor
I do not want dummies Vera, none is good.

  Laurel
That's because you cling too in standard fashion, then you should look for a new face, that goes well with your clothes, someone in this book, as I have told you.

  Eleanor
I hate the American style.

  Laurel
But it comes close to what you seek, they are current, trendy.

  Eleanor
If this person must represent Waldorf designs, I must find someone who ... deserves his clothes.

  Laurel
Yes.

  Eleanor
Someone like me. Someone like ... my daughter.

  Laurel
Well why does not it? You want someone who represents the lifestyle of the Waldorf. Who better to represent you as a family member?

  Eleanor
I made my first dress for her.

  Serena
She would love to!

  Blair
I can?

  Laurel
Eleanor?

  Eleaor
Yes. That's perfect.

  Laurel
Eleanor Waldorf, here is the new face of Waldorf for Bendel.

  Gossip Girl
It's a smile on the face of B. ? For once the spotlight is on her and S. helped him there. I suppose that miracles exist.

  Serena
It will be so sexy, the clothes are beautiful.

  Blair
They are.

  Serena
Shut up they are incredible.

  Blair
I give just a service to my mother. Hair and makeup trials are tonight.

  Katie
I think this is my best pose.

  Isabel
Because you see it. Model is that you hand. That's how to do ...

  Blair
The girls do not. That's how to do. No. We must bend the column forward, lengthening ...

  Serena
No, girls. You do anything. You miss the point. Look, you must get your hands on the hip and ask. That's how you have to do.

  Blair
Ask. Ask.

  Serena
Hello. Who is it?

  Blair
Who dares interrupt VDWoodsen when she teaches? I say that?

  Serena
Give me back my phone!

  Dan
Dan Humphrey.

  Serena
Who is it?

  Blair
I'm sorry, Dan, this number is no longer in service.

  Serena
Stop it, who it is?

  Blair
I give you service.

  Dan
I hear you. Do I talk to Serena?

  Blair
Apparently you can, sweetie.

  Serena
Come on, give it to me.

  Blair
My god.

  Serena
Hi, Dan. I'm really sorry for that.

  Dan
And I'm really ready to hang up.

  Serena
Blair was playing. You have my attention, I promise.

  Dan
Okay, because I was calling to ask you not to talk with me by going to the movies tonight.

  Serena
Tonight? Where? What time?

  Dan
In Sunshine at 7:00.

  Serena
I would love. See you there.

  Dan
I'll see you there.

  Rufus
It's complicated, is not it?

  Bex
I can not help but observe. This is hard work, in the best sense, gnigmatique ... Reminds me of Bacon or young Schnabel.

  Rufus
The artist lives in Hudson. I have represented for a while. Rufus.

  Bex
Bex Simon. I heard a lot about your gallery. I do not expect such a work from an old rock star.

  Rufus
I prefer "author of a tube".

  Bex
Why did you open a gallery?

  Rufus
I always wanted to be an artist.

  Bex
It has something in common, I continue always the artists. I shot all day in Brooklyn for a client, I'm buying, I did not find a work like this and I do not think she will long remain. I would like the book. Is that possible?

  Rufus
Yes, of course.

  Bex
What time do you close?

  Rufus
I will remain open.

  Bex
Good. Thank you.

  Chuck
What is Carter here?

  Nate
I invited him.

  Chuck
Or he invited himself alone? That's his style ... beg us to free us from our prisons while he crams free food and alcohol that our vacuum. It is a parasite and unn hypocrite.

  Nate
And a good basketball player if my memories are good. Are you afraid to lose against him, Chuck?

  Carter
If your father bought a basketball team instead of a hotel, you might have the skills.

  Chuck
This is the weekend of debauchery for new, not old. Go hang yourself.

  Carter
Let's get it on the ground.

  Chuck
No, right now.

  Nate
Calm down.

  Chuck
No, this is my part, I choose the players.

  Carter
I understand, I'm going.

  Nate
Hey man! The card game is tonight?

  Carter
Yes.

  Nate
Send me the address by text.

  Carter
Okay

  Nate
You were not doing that.

  Chuck
No want him here. It's an old blues brother everybody.

  Nate
Come on, play a little basketball.

  Terry
Ok, Blair, relax, head down, not moving and ... Ok, are you ready? Another, this time, breathe, jump, you coward. You cowards really this time. Relaxes you for that. Now give me your best pose. That's it. Come on, more. Think big. One, two, troix! Ok, take a break. Thank you very much. Who chose this girl?

  Laurel
Eleanor, why?

  Terry
It is so stilted and stiff, like a library, it is not natural.

  Laurel
Yes but it is fabulous in the clothes, right?

  Terry
To me, it looks like a goddess. In those eyes, yuck. Looks like a statue. This is not to sell to the press. She has to let go, have fun, have fun. How will the customer does not love the dress if the dummy will not like?

  Serena
All dabord, you are terrific!

  Blair
I know.

  Serena
But I can give you a little advice?

  Blair
I thought so.

  Serena
No, all you have to do is just let you go, you know? Bestir yourself. You could do the crazy like when you were 10 years and we danced to "Genie in a Bottle" in your mother's clothes.

  Blair
Help me. Help me.

  Serena
Daccord ... Be like a lion. Ok? Go! No, no, you gotta roar! Yes, yes am the tiger! Spread over the tiger! You're in the jungle. You're a savage! Now, let's make it a prettier. You are Venus in the half shell. Looks up. Let's do something crazy like britney and her umbrella. Ok, Britney and her umbrella. Go! In the car! In the car! Posh Spice in America. Ready? Go! It's Cyborg Spice for you. You have to do pouting and arching. You remember the hand on her hip. Cambre and poses. Going, continuous, you're a s*x bomb. This is perfect! You're doing great! You have in the skin! Look how beautiful you are. Poses.

  Blair
What are you doing?

  Serena
Oh, damn. I have to meet Dan.

  Blair
No, you stay here. I need you. I can not disappoint my mother.

  Dan
You arrive soon?

  Serena
I sui really sorry, but I'm kind of stuck at this photo session with Blair. It's a long story but I can not join you.

  Dan
A photo shoot?

  Serena
It sounds very superficial, I know, but it is important to her and you know, she matters to me. But I'd forgive, I promise.

  Dan
No, it does not matter you inkite not.

  Serena
You're the best, I knew you'd understand. I remember later.

  Dan
Yes, yes.

  Cashier
How?

  Dan
None.

  Bex
Are you still there?

  Rufus
Yes, I told you I would wait.

  Bex
A man who keeps his word. I like it.

  Rufus
You could talk to your client?

  Bex
I came back, right? Make me an invoice.

  Rufus
Really? It's great.

  Bex
You are terribly excited. This is not the first time, anyway? You sell a painting.

  Rufus
I already had the first few times but the artist is happy. It ... does something else for a while. It is very important to her.

  Bex
For my client too. This is a very special work. You would not ... I do not know, celebrate with a drink?

  Rufus
Well, we were talking about the artist is my wife.

  Bex
I thought the artist was living in Hudson ... Long journey.

  Rufus
She lives there. Not me.

  Bex
If ever the train had stopped ...

  Chuck: Phase three
the pub crawl: 5 districts, 50 pubs ... 500 chances to sleep tonight. And remember, do not dip your stick ... in the wrong pot of gold. Come on, you'll think of your boyfriend inside.

  Nate
I do not come.

  Chuck
Seriously, Carter Baizen fears. I do not know what spell did you cast it, but this is not your friend. You can not trust him.

  Nate
And why? Because it does not have the same values as you? This is exactly what he said. Money, drugs, privileges, they brutalize us so that we know that it's better in the real world.

  Chuck
The real world? Everyone around wants to be like us. We are what we want, not what we want to flee.

  Nate
You do not really understand me, huh?

  Chuck
Your dream for you, you know what it is? Because I hear you say you do not want to go to Dartmouth and you do not want to follow in the footsteps of your father, but what you want, exactly?

  Nate
No that's all I know.

  Chuck
You better find out before everything behind to find it. And where are you?

  Rufus
How was the movie?

  Dan
Loup ... Literally ... I do not know what to think of Serena, Dad, I do not know if it's worth it.

  Rufus
What do you mean?

  Dan
It is best friends with this girl, Blair Waldorf, who is everything I hate in the Upper East Side in a concentrated evil daughter of 43 kg with doe eyes, who dresses from couturiers and coming out of big words.

  Rufus
No one is as bad.

  Dan
She, though. I was exaggerating just saying it is Medusa who wants to find her petrifying gaze.

  Rufus
If there's one thing I learned is that in general ... there is something beneath the surface of these people, makes them act this way.

  Dan
Like what? Orange juice in her mimosa was in no hurry but concentrated? And said what about if Serena is her best friend?

  Rufus
I dated a girl like Serena once ... which resembled indeed much to Serena. And girls like that ... are challenges, yes. They are complicated and enigmatic ... and generally they are worth blow. And the only way to know for sure is there to jump in with both feet.

  Dan
What happened to you?

  Rufus
I swam a time ... until I drown.

  Dan
Thank you, it's a great story, Dad.

  Eleanor
Now sleep and I'll see you tomorrow morning. We'll go to the photo shoot together.

  Blair
You have not done that since I was little.

  Eleanor
You do more layers before 22h since you were little. You were really good tonight.

  Blair
Really?

  Dan
Hello?

  Serena
How was the movie? I missed something great?

  Dan
Yes, even without the film.

  Serena
Do not be arrogant, I call you with a reconciliation plan. Are you available now?

  Dan
Yes.

  Serena
How would you like to see what really happens during a photo shoot?

  Dan
I'm sorry, this is Dan Humphrey. You do not try to join my sister instead?

  Serena
I know it's a girl thing but tell you one thing: I'll be there.

  Dan
I can bet on it. Because according to probabilites, I lose my shirt.

  Serena
This is the photo shoot for Blair, I must be there in moral support.

  Dan
Blair? Finally, for sure, I do not come.

  Serena
It's not as bad as you think. In addition, it will be so busy with the shots you do not even see her and since it's so boring to be next, get my attention. Ok, and if you bought anything from the buffet?

  Dan
I thought it was free.

  Serena
A morning, 8am. I'll send the address via SMS, I hang up before you again protests.

  Dan
A feet together, Humphrey.

  Eleanor
What is the great urgency to keep me awake before the big day, Laurel, and why we have not just talked on the phone?

  Laurel
For if we had not seen in person, I would not have been able to show you these photos.

  Terry
This girl does not describe what you are trying to say inaccessible, mistress of herself, perfect.

  Eleanor
It is not inaccessible, it is full insurance, royal.

  Terry
I know it's your daughter and I do not want to create problems ... but ... your daughter is too steep a twig. You have to be afraid of it let you go so your designs and ... can not be in ... What is the word again?

  Eleanor
Symbiosis. What can we do now?

  Terry
Your daughter is beautiful, yes, but this girl ... this girl has in her! She is warm like the sun, she has fun. It will make customers believe that if they buy these clothes. They also have fun

  Laurel
But it's your decision, Eleanor. It is entirely your choice.

  Gossip Girl
The rules for dummies, the day of a shoot are the same as for a patient before operation ... do not eat or drink within 12 hours which precede. Wear comfortable clothes and you ensure that your affairs are in order. We do not know what could happen in a flash.

  Serena
Hi B, you must'm sleeping, be already be under way, but I can not wait to see you at the studio, we'll have fun!

  Eleanor
Thank you Lord, you're awake!

  Blair
I'm late? Oh my god, I slept too late?

  Eleanor
Honey, I have bad news. Teddy, this idiot photographer thinks we need to change direction.

  Blair
With the theme?

  Eleanor
With the dummy. Honey, I hired these people for their advice, and finally, they think ... it would damage the brand. I'm really sorry. I know you really wanted it.

  Blair
No, really, I'm glad I do not have to go. I hate photo shoots, it's so boring. You should take Alessandra Ambrosio and not an amateur.

  Eleanor
We take dinner after all, ok? Steak fries and pancakes "coffee artists" as before. A little while ago.

  Blair
Hi S., I hope you're not already there, as it turned out that my career in fashion was completed faster than Jessica Simpson in the movie. Now that I think about it, maybe we could become embedded in the photo shoot and see who replaces me, make fun of skinny bitch?

  Lily
How did you have?

  Rufus
I think it is really out of place here.

  Lily
I'm not kidding, Humphrey.

  Rufus
What are you doing with that?

  Lily
Why do the selling?

  Rufus
You ... you are the customer of Bex. And you did not know. I am surprised that you have hired someone who has taste.

  Lily
I'm as shocked as when she said she found a great thing in Brooklyn, your gallery does not come to me in mind.

  Rufus
You must admit the art to remind you of the place.

  Lily
I know your wife would not want it behind me.

  Rufus
Allison is a professional, has no control checks of potential buyers and me either. In addition it has been almost 20 years.

  Lily
And yet you know not women.

  Rufus
And you still know everything.

  Lily
Your wife despises me.

  Rufus
I would not say that.

  Lily
If she despises me. She wore a dress perhaps with suspenders and Doc Martens at the time but she really meant it.

  Rufus
It's not like you. She does not cling to this stuff.

  Lily
Why would not call you asking? Or are you leaving him still in space? Because, believe me, show it in my house, even after this conversation, will only further away.

  Rufus
What do you do?

  Lily
Take back the. You can call Bex to establish reimbursement.

  Rufus
What you have in mind?

  Lily
I thought ... it was amazing.

  Chuck (message to Nate)
We need to talk, where are you?

  Nate (message to Chuck)
Fives Stars in Queens. I'll call you later.

  Carter
No phone!

  Nate
That's right, sorry dude.

  Carter
You made how much?

  Nate
$5000

  Carter
That's insane, amigo.

  Nate
I should stop until I win.

  Carter
What? It has just begun.

  Nate
I played well. And it's better to leave your head up.

  Carter
I'm not gonna let that happen. The table will shrink. People will start to unfold. Up to now was that the cards but ... Now, it's an adventure. A few more hands.

  Man
Ok, let's continue.

  Nate
Ok

  Carter
Let's play.

  Blair
You foues Me?

  Teddy
Fantastic! One, two, three...

  Serena
There it is. Blair. Come quickly! What made you take so long? Blair. Blair, wait, where are you going? Blair, wait, why are you so angry?

  Blair
Why am I angry? Why I am not angry, yes? How I have thought for a second that this would be different this time.

  Serena
Different?

  Blair
You stand it spotlights are on me for once, eh?

  Serena
What are you talking? I was told that we would do together. What you did not get my message?

  Blair
And this morning, then? When you saw the call sheet, my name was there? I was not the hair, makeup, this was normal? The locker room wearing only your name, you've thought it was an oversight?

  Serena
I was told that you had of late, and they asked me to make the catch before. Blair, they told me you wanted me to do.

  Blair
And you have them raw?

  Serena
Look Blair, I am encouraged to do so. Why I would try to steal what I have to push?

  Blair
Because you take me for everything! Nate, my mother ...

  Serena
Blair!

  Blair
You can not help it, that's what you are. I just thought that this time, it would be different. I should have known that I was wrong. Super.

  Gossip Girl
Spotted ... rude awakening of a boy alone. Queens of the Upper East Side were not born at the top. They are moving up in heels. No matter on which they must walk to get there.

  Eleanor
It has to come back. There you are! Terry told me that you are ...

  Serena
Eleanor, I quit.

  Eleanor
Wait a minute. Why?

  Serena
I think you know!

  Eleanor
Because of Blair? I know she will understand my decision when I have explained. You know you like the spotlight ever since. It's part of your charm, there is nothing wrong with that. Who are you? Ridges that you here?

  Dan
I do not know, actually.

  Dan
I'm surprised you on the stairs.

  Serena
Dan, listen, I really can not talk now.

  Dan
Ok, forget what I told you so. In fact, I am dumb. I'll just stay here and very silently flashing. Unless you do veuilles ...

  Serena
To do without my jeans? Yes, please.

  Dan
It's just that ... I thought you wanted to stay on the sidelines here. You wanted to be here for your friend Blair. You know, we had to use the buffet and I must have all your attention.

  Serena
Say it.

  Dan
I do not think it necessary am.

  Serena
So my best friend does not believe me and the boy that I like either. Listen, Dan, Blair's mother trapped me for bringing me here. Because she did not want Blair. How to say something like that her best friend?

  Dan
I do ...

  Serena
Look, you know what, Dan? Go out of here, ok? I need my makeup and I just need to leave here.

  Blair
Serena send you to talk to me?

  Dan
No, believe it or not, I came to myself.

  Blair
I normally would not be so near you without a tetanus shot.

  Dan
Ma .. my mother went there a few months. Only my ... father and sister do not see it because she told us she was away for the summer to pursue his dream of being an artist. But this is no longer summer, and it is still there. And that is all that seems to interresser right now. Whenever I visit, I tell myself: "This time I will tell him what I think." "This time I will look into the eyes and tell you to go on, be you I'm leaving for good." And then I was there the other day I was sitting at the table opposite her, looking her straight in the eye, and I said nothing.

  Blair
Why?

  Dan
I do not know but I would have liked because even though it would not have changed, she would know how I feel

  Man
As, sir. First bet.

  Man 1
$5000.

  Man 2
5 to follow.

  Nate
I have no money, am his bet.

  Carter
It was only luck. You are daccord for the brand that?

  Nate
I do not think it's a good idea.

  Carter
If you never take any risks, begins now. What is the point of playing if not? It's good.

  Man 1
You sure he is leaving?

  Carter
Of course, this is an Archibald.

  Nate
I raise to $10,000.

  Man 2
5 to follow.

  Man 1
I am.

  Men
Show your cards. Set of aces. The set of aces wins.

  Carter
It's hard.

Nate
  You told me to play.

  Carter
This is the chance my friend. He had three aces.

  Nate
Look, I do ... It may take me a while to find the money.

  Carter
Wait, wait. Time? Come on, man, snaps fingers...

  Nate
Wait a minute. You're with these guys? You've fooled? You fooled me, huh? I take that as a yes.

  Carter
Give him the money, man. It's nothing for you. They do not joke but nobody gets hurt. I try to help you.

  Chuck
Yeah, you're a true friend.

  Carter
Who left you enter Bass?

  Nate
I was trapped.

  Carter
It is not forced. It was at the fair.

  Chuck
Really?

  Carter
Be you give them money now, I am told them where you live, and they will take it to your father. What do you think?

  Chuck
Look ... you took my watch and my ball. You keep them, you care for these types. I do not call the cops and it breaks.

  Carter
Okay, I'm on it, I'll take care

  Nate
I will transfer money and pray that the captain did not see it before bailing out.

  Chuck
You do not have to pay me back. It was worth all the pennies to see how this guy ended.

  Nate
No, I care ... Really ... Thank you. It is not possible.

  Chuck
What?

  Nate
I'm zero.

  Chuck
You're perhaps on the wrong account.

  Nate
No, something is wrong. I accessed the account last month and there was near $ 200 000.

  Nate
Tom, thank you for reminding me so quickly.

  Tom
Your message said it was important.

  Nate
Yeah, I checked my account and there must be some mistake, my money seems to be zero.

  Tom
I thought you knew. This account was emptied several weeks ago.

  Nate
Emptied? But ... by whom?

  Tom
Your dad. He said he had spoken with you.

  Terry
We must solve it. What will we do?

  Laurel
Blair, baby, there is a terrible mistake. Would you find your job?

  Blair
Did you choose Serena in my place? You could have chosen a stranger. You did not choose my best friend. You thought I would not know?

  Eleanor
I was going to tell you tonight ... dinner. There was no right decision. There was no time. I know you can understand all that. It was mismanaged ... all ... from beginning to end.

  Blair
That I Wanna Be daccord with you?

  Eleanor
Bendel will legitimize this company. It's going to take it to another level. You know how I worked hard for it. You were always my biggest supporter, my biggest fan.

  Blair
I am your daughter.

  Eleanor
And as such, I knew you would forgive me in time, but if my company had lost the market because of you, I'd never forgive me.

  Blair
I hope so.

  Gossip Girl
We do not have it said, but in the life of every girl, there comes a moment when she realizes that her mother might be more disturbed it.

  Serena
You're still there?

  Dan
Yeah, I could not leave without you bring something from the buffet. And you say I'm sorry to have judged.

  Serena
I'm sorry for giving you reasons to do so. And if you invite me again to come out?

  Dan
And if you really came?

  Serena
Ok, no drama, no disruption, I promise.

  Dan
You promise? No! That means it'll never happen.

  Serena
Ok, quick! I withdraw, I de-promise.

  Dan
Friday, 20 hours ...

  Blair
I think we can accept these conditions but you can not wear these shoes. Neither this cup.

  Serena
Blair. Ok, more.

  Dan
Daccord.

  Serena
You were right.

  Blair
I know.

  Serena
When I got this call, I should have known that you had nothing to do with it. And I should never have to push yourself to do all that first.

  Blair
Well, I'm glad that thou hast pushed. It turned out to be a very important day for me. I just thought it'd be funnier.

  Serena
I know, me too. You know what? Who says it can no longer be? Go. Go.

  Gossip Girl
S. and B. committing a crime of fashion. Who does not like to buy with five fingers? Especially if one of the fingers is the middle one.

  Eleanor
Where are my clothes?

  Gossip Girl
Everyone knows you can not choose your family, but we can choose our friends and in a world governed by the origins and bank accounts, it is to have a friend.

  Serena
Repeat it, one, two ... One, two, three ...

  Gossip Girl
Although the "best friends for life" can put you in the end, one can not deny that we'd all be a little less rich without them. And Serena and Blair, they are the "best" better than anyone. No, these are not tears in my eyes, it's just an allergy. Without you I am nothing. Gossip Girl.

[In the living room of the Waldorf]

  Gossip Girl (Blair and his servants preparing the evening)
Nate being party to help Chuck's father to close his yacht for the season, B. has plenty of time to devote himself to the most important event of the fall: his sleepover. A tradition must! Each year surpassing the previous in terms of decadence. Reputations are made as quickly as they come apart. As for the budget, it is unlimited! Of bed linen glittering grand buffet, nothing is missing except the best friend of Blair, the chief star of sleepovers, I named S. Van Der Woodsen!

[At the Art Gallery of Rufus]

  Dan
Dad, I'm going to the bank. You want me to deposit the check from Mom while I'm there? (Shakes a bag filled with coins)

  Rufus
Tell me, you've robbed a parking meter?

  Dan
Nah, I finally decided to break the bank that you gave me for my 10 years. It can not be both a man and still have a piggy bank! It was time for me to kill the pig in china!

  Rufus
So it's finally the big night?

  Dan
Yeah, and I planned everything. (Looking at his bag filled with coins) An evening that will weigh three pounds in order to nose!

  Rufus
I know my hot date back to last for ages but I can not believe that cinema has risen to that point!

  Dan
I'm going out with Serena Van Der Woodsen, I can still not take her to the movies! I want it to be as exceptional evening! Uh ... the check, you want me to file it? (Rufus looks away) You still have not told him. Dad, this is the first time she sells a painting, you would still have prevented, it is not nothing to it!

  Rufus
I know, suddenly I thought it would be a good idea to surprise her. I intend to go to Hutson give him the check in person.

  Dan
Um.

  Rufus
What? The good news is better to announce the opposite, right?

  Dan
It's quite the opposite. If she sees you land it may concern.

  Rufus
You're saying that, uh ... you have not let me go, huh?

  Dan
I'm saying that mom is not a big fan of surprises. You remember this, that famous anniversary with the clown and his llama?

  Rufus
Yes... I Pfou, I really screwed up, huh.

  Dan
Total!

  Rufus
Hmm. Oh, uh ... a phone call before it is not luxury.

  Dan
(shaking his bag filled with coins) Do you need money?

[In the halls of Constance]

  Serena
Jenny! If there's someone good who can help me it's you! I think I'll go crazy, I'm doing. J'me poses full of questions! Your brother something simmering for tonight and I can not know.

  Jenny
My brother is a very mysterious guy, you had not noticed?

  Serena
Wait, I even know where he wants to go. You did not have a clue to me spinning? You think he'll take me to a club to listen to obscure group denies that nobody knows or, or an exhibition of painting underground in Brooklyn, or ... Oh, is this-that the film festival has already begun ?

  Jenny
You leave little room for surprises you!

  Serena
I do not know how to loll for surprises. I always put the reverse of what is necessary!

  Jenny
Well, jeans and a tee shirt that will be impeccable '! In the family we dress very relaxed all day!

  Serena
Hmm... (his phone rings) Oh, he's my brother!

  Jenny
Kiss him!

  Serena (on phone)
Eric! Are you okay? Jenny kiss you!

  Eric (on phone)
I kiss too! Thou hast torn the news?

  Serena (on phone)
No! Not one. So, where are you in?

  Eric (on phone)
My bags are ready to go.

  Serena (on phone)
And hey, is this-that mom is still there?

  Eric (on phone)
Yes, she is talking with the doctor. I can not believe that I still go for the weekend! What is it like a weekend? I even remember! What time you go out? It would be nice crosses.

  Serena (on phone)
At 7 o'clock. I look forward to seeing you.

  Eric (on phone)
Me too! Bye!

  Serena (on phone)
I love you much! At any time!

  Blair
What-I learn? Eric to leave, it falls great!

  Serena
How so?

  Blair
Well, your mother and your brother can dine face to face while we will make you crazy by showing our ass behind the tinted windows of the limo!

  Serena
B. What are you talking there?

  Blair
In the most important event of the season.

  Serena
Oh, the sleepover!

  Blair
I prefer short evening. Sleepover sounds a bit too adolescent.

  Serena
You know I could not be there, I have something tonight.

  Blair
S. ! When the Waldorf are a party, you go without asking any question.

  Serena
I'm with Dan tonight. You know, the one you took so long to be considered as a human being worthy of your attention. Sorry, uh ...

  Jenny
Nah, that's nothing!

  Serena
Look, I want it hot date but it is untouchable. Finally, maybe we will later make a cuckoo!

  Blair
Nah, nah it will not be possible! I hate the cuckoos. So if you refuse to come, I'll have to find you a replacement. Pass me the waiting list!

  Serena
Okay, good! I must go. See ya!

  Jenny
Good luck tonight.

  Serena
Thank you!

  Blair
Little Jenny Humphrey! Why I have not thought of it sooner! If you got anything planned, I invite you to my evening.

  Jenny
I? Are you sure?

  Kati & Isabel
She! Are you sure?

  Blair
Only one thing: if you come, will have to prepare yourself to do anything but sleep!

  Jenny
I'm ready for anything!

  Blair
My flat ', 19 am sharp!

  Jenny
Okay. See you later!

  Blair
Hmm ... Oh, his first sleepover! She is not ready to forget it, we finally do the right thing.

  Blair's friend (1)
I wonder how long it will take.

  Blair's friend (2)
50 dollars it takes 1 hour absolute maximum!

[In the room of Eric Ostrov]

  Eric
Wait, I do not understand. He told me that I was ready, we talked about it this morning during my session.

  Lily
What he said was that you could go home, not that you had to go.

  Eric
But Mom, you promised!

  Lily
I do not want to argue about it. I need to think about.

  Eric
If you-like-.

  Lily
It's not a decision I take lightly. It does not come out of here like this, hands in pockets. There's papers to be signed, forms to fill, insurance ...

  Eric
It's not possible! You wanna lock me here forever?

  Lily
If you continue to believe that it is I who shut in here, this is proof that you are not yet ready to be autonomous. We'll talk tomorrow, okay?

  Eric
Yeah, yeah we'll talk.

[In the living room of the suite of Van Der Woodsen]

  Serena
Hi!

  Dan
Hi! (Looking at the casual dress of Serena) Uh ... I'm ahead or? Hmm ...

  Serena
Hmm ... Nah, nah, nah! I ... It is I who am late. Come in! Uh ... I surrender one second time to go put on something a little less comfortable.

  Dan
Sure, yes, yes!

  Serena
You're entitled to talk to me while I change.

  Dan
I hesitate.

  Serena
Okay.

  Dan
It's pretty cool that little furnished, that you share with 800 other roommate!

  Serena
Yeah, well when you live at the hotel you turn round quickly after a time, eh! Sometimes I feel like a mouse trapped in a laboratory.

  Dan
Except that lab mice do not have the chance to have a plasma screen and room service, well I guess.

  Lily
Dan! Serena knows you're there?

  Dan
Yes, yes, yes! It was she who opened my. Finally I hope that was it. It should be about this size, rather blond.

  Lily
A merry-maker now! I love it.

  Dan, looking at Lily's shopping bags
Fever buyer?

  Lily
I needed to decompress. So where is it-are you going to take my daughter tonight?

  Dan
Oh, I really know. J'pensais maybe take her to explore the subway tunnels to present my friends moles. Very friendly. A little gruff but very friendly. Sorry I do not know why I say all this is a fault I have when I'm nervous I can not stop talking. It's horrible. When I was little, it seems that what I liked most was learning vocabulary. You know what I like? Your daughter. I love it, really. I ... Wow!

  Lily
Reassured me, you will not take that bag with that dress?

  Serena
But Mom!

  Lily
Oh, wait. (Unearthing a sack among his purchases) Take that!

  Serena
Oh, thank you! And, uh... where is Eric? It should be there by now.

  Lily
He was too tired to go tonight.

  Serena
Mom!

  Lily
Later.

  Serena
(turning to Dan) Come, let's go.

  Lily
One o'clock in the mornin 'limit. Extra bonus if you come back at least a quarter.

[In front of the Palace Hotel]

  Serena
Han is not true! A vespa! Han is a fabulous idea! I love, it drives me crazy! I believe it, I swear. You can not know what effect it makes me, I toured Italy vespa. This is one of my best memories! My mother has always refused to buy me one, we saw a car with a driver. But I assure you, Dan, this is an insane idea! Really! Here we go, where are the helmets?

  The Limo Driver
Mr. Humphrey!

  Serena
Oh! Ah, that is your driver.

  Dan
Yeah!

  Serena
Okay, great.

  Gossip Girl
seen in front of the Palace Hotel, Cinderella amount in a pumpkin while she dreamed of a carriage ride! But the lonely boy Rest assured, we have other fairy tales in stock.

[In the living room of the Waldorf]

  Dorota, welcoming Jenny
This way, if you please.

  Jenny
Thank you!

  Blair, you choose their outfits
It's not bad.

  Stylist
And this one?

  Blair
Yeah it is.

  Dorota, showing the sleeping bag to Jenny
Do- I can get rid of?

  Blair
Oh, Jenny! Oh that's cool that you came!

  Gossip Girl
Let me give you good advice Jenny in this environment, censorship can be as fast as the fall. I hope your sleeping bag is also part of the fall!

  Blair's friend (1)
Let the party begin!

[In the dining room]

  Dan, looking at the map
Uh... How are the braised quail?

  Server
Very good, sir.

  Dan
Oh, uh, okay. And the chipions?

  Server
squid! It's delicious.

  Dan
Oh yes! What's that?

  Server
cuttlefish, sir.

  Dan
Oh, uh, I feel like it too. Hmm, I'll take the chicken, it's safer.

  Waiter
Yes, sir. Miss?

  Serena
I'll take a lobster bisque and duck with olives, if you please.

  Host
Thank you, Mademoiselle.

  Dan
I find it slightly snubbed me. But I dined there often. I'm what they call a regular. (Looking for senior couples) I come for the customer: sparkling, fresh, full of life ... They give really hard, believe me, with all those facelifts.

  Serena
Hmm... You'll excuse me? I, um... I'll take a walk to the bathroom, just to refresh myself.

  Dan
Yeah, sure, sure. I think the toilets are...

  Serena
Oh, do not worry I'll find.

  Dan
Oh, if you please! How much she ordered the duck?

  Server
$78, sir.

  Dan
Okay, uh ... So thank you, is this-that you could cancel my chicken and then I would take my input instead.

  Server
Naturally, sir.

  Dan
That's very kind, thank you!

[In the living room of the Waldorf]

  Blair, watching Jenny try outfits
Too much pink! Ha... too panther! Too... blue flower! Oh... wow, even I'm impressed!

  Jenny
Really? Because I feel very comfortable.

  Blair
Well, as my mother often say, fashion and comfort are not made for each other. The appearance is the only thing that matters. And you, you look like someone who goes to a child's taste. But before continuing the makeover, a small glass.

  Jenny
Um ... thank you nan. I do not like vodka.

  Blair
Well that's good because it's the Gin! No vodka. It is an evening Jenny, then either you drink it, or you return to your small metro. Whatever you want!

  Jenny
Hmm. (Taking a sip from his glass of gin)

  Blair
Okay, it's time to play-acting or truth.

  Jenny
Oh, I love playing that! Once I had to swallow a whole bag of machmallow!

  Blair
Yes it would be great fun but we are not playing like that.

  Jenny
And how do you play then? (Kati & Isabel kiss) I will choose truth!

[At the Art Gallery of Rufus]

  Alexander (on phone)
Hello! Allo!

  Rufus (hanging up)
Han, sh1t! Han, I'm more a teen!

  Alexander (on phone)
Hello!

  Rufus (the phone)
Uh, yes. Uh, I had the wrong number.

  Alexander (on phone)
It is you who just called?

  Rufus (the phone)
Sorry, yes it was me but I'm pretty sure it was the right number.

  Alexander (on phone)
Are you looking for that?

  Rufus (the phone)
Do-Allison Humphrey's there?

  Alexander (on phone)
Uh, not leave a second! She goes out of her shower. All '! This is for you! It is from that?

  Rufus (the phone)
Rufus Humphrey. And you are?

  Alexander (on phone)
Alexander Bancroft. Uh ... I, uh ... a friend of Allison.

  Rufus (the phone)
Well there is two way.

  Allison (on phone)
I'm here, I'm there! I'm coming. Allo!

[In the dining room]
Dan (the server taking away his plate): Thank you!

  Serena
Um ... Are you sure you want to order something else? Your entry was not very hearty.

  Dan
Nah, nah, nah, nah! It was perfect. I even know that the cream of fish it was.

  Server
Want to see the dessert menu?

  Serena
Oh, no thank you, I think it will go.

  Dan
No dessert, you're safe?

  Serena
Yes.

  Dan
Okay, so give me the bill if you please.

  Serena
Um ... Actually, I already paid the bill at any time.

  Dan
What?

  Server
Hmm.

  Serena
Yes. I, I used the credit card of my mother, it's nothing I assure you, really.

  Dan
You know I can pay. I have money on me.

  Serena
Yes, I would not doubt one second. But you're not obliged to spend it here.

  Dan
Wait, I understand there. I made a mistake?

  Serena
Nah, listen. I wanted to spend an evening with you, and you thought you'd like it here. That is, it does not matter.

  Dan
Okay, okay. Well, in this case, if this is the real Dan Humphrey you want, then you'll have it and I'm assured that you will not be disappointed! Let's go!

  Serena
Oh yeah?

  Dan
Yeah! Miss.

[At the reception desk of Ostrov]
Blair (who photographed the air): It's true! I have a problem! This is the super mega catamaran '! I need a prescription!

  Nurse
What is that you took as a drug?

  Blair
Hmm ... Caffeine, nicotine, stamen, cocaine, heroin, codeine ... Not to mention amphetamines, morphine ... Anything that ends in-ine in fact! I do not discriminate.

  Nurse
It's yes, indeed! (On phone) I have a code yellow, 6th floor! (Hangs up) I leave you a minute, I will seek help!

  Blair
And I would love a cappuccino!

[In the room of Eric Ostrov]

  Blair
Come, the way is clear! (Eric watching his quickdraw) You wanted some fresh air, right? And I wanted to help you!

  Lily (on phone)
Hello! What ...!? Uh ... but tell me, he was with that? But ... how is that possible? ... Young, blonde, cute, yes! This is his sister. I'll do it. Thank you! (Serena hanging up and calling on his cell remained after) Oh Of course!

[In the room of a bar]
Dan (putting the cue ball in the round): Wow! Bull's eye!

  A guy at the bar
Bravo! This is the beautiful game
Dan (tending to Serena won money playing pool): Uh ... 75 dollars. It pays your duck.

  Serena
Oh, well! Thank you.

  Dan
So who's next?

  Serena
Why not me?

  Dan
You?

  Serena
Yes, unless you have fear of losing?

  Dan
I would not even attempt to let you win by gallantry.

  Serena
Oh yeah?

  Dan
Yeah.

  Serena
That's what you think?

  Dan
That's what I think.

  Serena
Well, the balls together. I'll put on some music.

[In the living room of Humphrey / In the room following the Van Der Woodsen]

  Rufus (the phone)
I hope it's not you Allison!

  Lily (on phone)
Rufus, what is it this way to win?

  Rufus (the phone)
Lily?

  Lily (on phone)
I need the mobile number of your son. That's an emergency.

  Rufus (the phone)
A true emergency or an urgency to Lily?

  Lily (on phone)
Eric is gone!

  Rufus (the phone)
Missing! But where?

  Lily (on phone)
Well, um ... he was in his room here at the hotel. I, I can not reach him. He does not answer the phone. I think he is with Serena.

  Rufus (the phone)
You called him?

  Lily (on phone)
She forgot her cell phone. I beg you, I really need the number of your son.

  Rufus (the phone)
Leave them alone. I'm sure they spend a good evening. Do not worry for your son.

  Lily (on phone)
I am so worried, however.

  Rufus (the phone)
What are you talking about? Your son is with your daughter is with my son. I make them complete trust, do the same.

  Lily (on phone)
Rufus!

  Rufus (the phone)
Hi, hello, next time!

[In the hall of Visconti]

  Visconti's a guy
Hey, beautiful brunette! Do not you want a quiet one s'trouve both, just to get to know?

  Blair
Well, usually I never say 'never', but then I'll make an exception. (Turning to her friends) This is the mafia of traders or what? They are rednecks with their suit!

  Jenny
Well, Eric is here! To you now. Truth or Dare?

  Blair
In your opinion?

  Jenny
J'te defy go ride a shovel this guy!

  Blair
Easy.

  Jenny
We have to believe in it.

  Kati & Isabel
Oh dear!

  Blair
Take in the seed, Choupinette! (The guy kissing the Visconti)
A friend of the guy (1): Do not worry they will say anything to Amanda!

  Blair
Who is Amanda?

  The guy's Visconti
Actually, this is my fiancee.

  Blair
Oh! It is better to be left out of it, do not you think?
A friend of the guy (2): Wow, that's clear!
Blair (shaking the phone the guy in front of Jenny Visconti): Look what I dug up! I want you to call his girlfriend. Her name is Amanda.

  Jenny
Statement Challenge! (On phone) Hello! Amanda? Hello, j'm'appelle Bla ... uh, Claire! Yes, j'viens put my tongue in the mouth of a boy and I'm sorry because I just learned that he was your boyfriend! I had to tell you. It's a real gun! Ciao!

  A friend of Blair
On the evening of the year!

  Gossip Girl
There is a beginning to everything in life. The little Jenny is perhaps more so small that it after all!

[In the room of a bar]

  Serena (goofing)
Oh, no!

  Dan
End of the Game! You've taken a monumental plate! Viewing: 4-0!

  Serena
Oh, I'm as bad as that?

  Dan
There's no word to describe the way you play!

  Serena
Han, good. You promised me you would learn if I lost again.

  Dan
Okay, okay. I will keep my promise. I do it for you and I do it to save the honor of American billiards.

  Serena
Wow!
Dan Go, j'te shows. The most important thing is the pool is ... (handing him his cue) Here, take this. The most important thing is the corners. The right angles, of course. Go ahead try.

  Serena
Okay!

  Dan
Um ... back a bit by hand.

  Serena
Hmm.

  Dan
Here.

  Serena
Okay.

  Dan
And, uh ... wait, a little right there. You type slowly and you do slide together, okay?
Serena (loupant his stroke): Oh! This is my last song!

  Dan
I did not know you liked the music.

  Serena
Yes. There are still a bunch of things you know about me.

  Dan
Oh, uh, outside of your natural talent for billiards! What else?

  Serena
Hmm ... What I love being here with you.

  Dan
That I knew.

  Serena
Oh, uh, there's something that is going to vibrate in your pocket. I think it's your phone.

  Dan
Oh, uh, wait. Oh, that's my father! Knowing him, it must be something important.

  Serena
Oh, yes, take it. Go!

  Dan (on phone)
Hello! What, Nan, nan, nan, it is not there. Serena has forgotten his cell phone!

  Serena
What? What is the matter?

  Dan (on phone)
Oh! Yes, yes, yes, she is beside me. Taking Charge!

  Serena
What? What is happening?

  Dan
Small change of plans.

  Serena
No! Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah! I disagree. I want to leave, not right in learning.

  Dan
I know.

  Serena
And do not forget that you promised to fill my gaps!

  Dan
I forget them, and the table either.

  Serena
Well, what does that may be more important to the world that what we are doing? It can not wait until tomorrow?

  Dan
Nah it can not, you must call your brother right away.

[In the living room of Humphrey]
Rufus (opening his front door): It's you!

  Lily
Well ...

  Rufus
I was about ...

  Lily
I spent a few phone calls and nobody in my family knows your son. Unbelievable but true! So is Dan Humphrey is an assumed name, is it really very few friends. Anyway, I need his number.

  Rufus
After hanging up all the time, I thought I could be a little more understanding.

  Lily
Han, you think ...

  Rufus
And I called Dan.

  Lily
Thank you very much.

  Rufus
And your son is not with them.

  Lily
Are you sure?

  Rufus
But Serena was able to reach him and he is fine. They will call us as soon as they are with him.

  Lily
Great! And you tell me that when counted, exactly?

  Rufus
I was about to do. Well, even if it delights me not, you can wait with me. They will soon be called.

  Lily
Okay. Do not think I'll accept the glass of rotgut you gonna offer me. But I could eat something. Thank you for the offer. (Rufus pouting) What? Do not tell me you know cooking?

[In the hall of Visconti]

  Dan
You see Jenny and your brother?

  Serena
No!

  Amanda
Is that you? It's you Claire?

  Serena
What? No!

  Dan
Are you sure that is the right place?

  Serena
Yes!

  Dan
Come!

  Amanda
Hey, tell me, where do-is it?

  The guy's Visconti
My smart! This-that what art ... But who are you talking about? You see it is between friends there! Hey, you the girl in red! Where is my phone?

  Dan
Hey! Calm down!

  The guy's Visconti
Where it comes out?

  Blair
It's alright, your phone is on our table. You would have noticed at least if you were busy at the mouth to get drunk chicks matter.

  Amanda
I'll pulverize you!

  Blair
Oh! You must surely be Amanda, right? Well in your place I think twice before marrying this little sh1t! (By growing by Amanda)

  Serena
Hey, hey, hey, you touch it, okay?

  Blair
I do not need you to dfendes!

  Serena
Pfou!

  Jenny
Anyway it's not even that you've called it, that's me.
Dan, Jenny?

  Amanda
So what language was it?

  Dan
The language! -But what are you doing here? You were not a sleepover?

  Amanda
Wait, do not tell me what is it that you kissed?

  Dan
Have you kissed this guy?

  The guy's Visconti
Nah, I kissed each other!

  Blair
Oh, it was a challenge.

  Amanda
A Challenge! How old are you: 10 years?

  Dan: Just over
14 years!
The guy from Visconti & Amanda: 14 years!

  The guy's Visconti
Gosh, I have believed. Damn, I swear it looks! It is a sacred tease.

  Dan
What? Repeat that!

  Jenny
Dan, you stop interfering, okay? You complicated matters further.

  Dan
What complicates things is the piece of fabric you have on your back.

  The guy's Visconti
Yeah, that's what I said.

  Dan
You, you say nothing and you shut up! (Fighting with the guy from Visconti)

  Serena
Hey!

  Jenny
Oh!

  Vigil Visconti
Come on, everybody out or I'll call the cops!

  Dan
Okay, okay!
Eric (just arriving): Hey, Serena! You see I told you it was traveling.

  Vigil Visconti
Exit if you please!

  Serena
Come on, let's go.

  Gossip Girl
Preview: The big brother fearless driving to the help of the little sister in distress! But can we really help someone who does not want?

[In the kitchen of Humphrey]
Rufus (preparing a dish with Lily): What? What is wrong?

  Lily
Oh! Nothing at all! This is what I am looking forward to eating a dish made from scratch. I add just a little bit of salt.

  Rufus
Why? It's impeccable '!

  Lily
Do not worry, just a pinch.

  Rufus
It's stronger than you, you always have all controls.

  Lily
Well you not complain at the time!

  Rufus
But I was not allowed. It was part of the settlement.

  Lily
Yes, finally, I am perhaps a tad psychorigid but life is far from easy. Especially when you have children. When they are small it is the only thing that matters to them, then, growing up they build a kind of barrier. It is found on one side and the other of them.

  Rufus
Yes, but they still need us. While they admit it.

  Lily
Yes, maybe Serena. But Eric, I do not understand how it works.

  Rufus
A boy of 14 who made the wall, it's nothing extraordinary.

  Lily
Actually it was not at the hotel when it happened. He ran away from the center Ostrov.

  Rufus
He was in Ostrov?

  Lily
Yes.

  Rufus
Drugs or alcohol?

  Lily
Oh, no. It has nothing to do. It just feels, well ... a little lonely.

  Rufus
It's a depression? But it is severe?

  Lily
Enough so that it has attempted suicide.

  Rufus
I'm sorry ... Hmm.

  Lily
I do not know why, but I actually do not know what I did or what I missed, but the worst is that I do not know what to do to be sure that it never remake .

  Rufus
It's best that you are listening to.
Lily (phone rings) Oh, let it be children!

  Rufus (the phone)
Hello! ... Yes, great! ... Uh, yeah, uh, I'll tell his mother. She is with me ... It's a long story ... Yes, at any time! (Hangs up) Eric is with Dan and Serena, and everything seems to go.

  Lily
I'd better go find them.
Rufus (showing their meals): J't'emballe that?

  Lily
Nah, actually it's silly are you cool if I prevail. So I go, I will stay here, quick snack.

  Rufus
It's true that it would have been a shame to ruin the dinner.

[Before the Visconti]

  Serena
What is that you took?

  Blair
He could, he wanted to go out and have fun.

  Serena
And you dragged into the box!

  Blair
So what! I do not see what is wrong! I thought it would make you happy.

  Serena
Well no, not at all. And I can not believe that you have dared to do that!

  Eric
Wait, I have not been kidnapped you know. I followed my own free will. B. did it for my own good.

  Blair
You see!

  Serena
Maybe, but it was not a service to you. You'll get yelled at.

  Eric
Yes, I know. And whatever happens, it was worth it! It was worth it to go out and talk to someone who is neither you nor mother, even if it is B. Without offending you.

  Blair
I'm far from it.

  Serena
I hate that it has come there. I'll take care of mom, okay?

  Eric
Thank you!

  Serena
Now she knows that you're safe, we'll, we'll go without stress. You want us to work?

  Blair
Ugh, call me!

  Serena
Yeah, I call you.

  Blair
I was talking to Eric.

[In an alley next to the Visconti]

  Dan
What are you playing there? I do not feel that it's you.

  Jenny
And you call yourself that? Dad?

  Dan
Well, we talk about that here. Come with me, j'te accompanies.

  Jenny
Nah, we will not take me home because I will not return.
Blair (the caller of the sidewalk across the street): You just Jenny!

  Jenny
Yeah, one second! Listen, I know it's gone a little spin tonight.

  Dan
It's the least we can say.

  Jenny
J'me'm under no illusions about the girls, and then I know who I am. This is not because I go out with Blair that I will change.

  Blair
Come on! We are going.

  Jenny
I'm coming! If you-please-let me go! And listen, in half an hour I'm under the covers, I promise.

  Dan
Okay, okay.

  Jenny
Thank you!

  Serena
So?

  Dan
So?

  Serena
Well, I must back to the center so that's where our paths diverge.

  Dan
What? No, no, no, no, I'm coming with you.

  Serena
No, I assure you, it's not worth it.

  Dan
I feel like it. Come, let's go.

[In front of the store Eleanor Waldorf]

  Gossip Girl
Something tells me that the action part is going to play truth or extensions! The little does she know that Jenny B. can not stand to lose at his own game?

  Jenny
You want me to pique jacket is on display?

  Blair
Have you understood everything!

  Jenny
But this is the store of your mother. I mean, you got the right to take whatever you want.

  Blair
In this case too. (Giving him the keys to the store) Unless you have no desire, I understand perfectly. I do not blame you would stick.

  Jenny
I understand!

  Blair
So do not do it but stop so close it's ridiculous!

  Jenny
The jacket?

  Blair
Yes, just the jacket. (Jenny looking in the shop) Here we go! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ... Go quickly size it is!
Jenny (the alarm goes off): Han! Hey, where is it-are you? Let me out!

[In the kitchen of Humphrey]

  Lily
Oh! You know I struggle to recognize you in this picture that I took!

  Rufus
What are you talking about! It's not you who has taken! You were not at this show.

  Lily
No, but you kidding? If I remember correctly, the first song was about me, the second spoke of, of your beloved motorcycle, and in third you spoke of, a surf spot. Where it was already?

  Rufus
Sayurita!

  Lily
Sayurita!

  Rufus
A fishing village.

  Lily
With this beautiful house where we ... Yes, this was it me back. I had to take eight rolls of pictures that night.

  Rufus
And why did you let down the picture anyway? You loved it so much!

  Lily
Well we must believe that I'd rather be a high-class whore.

  Rufus
Ah!

  Lily
I remember the same black dress I wore that night!

  Rufus
Oh yeah?

  Lily
Yeah.

  Rufus
Uh ... I think I remember it was blue.

  Lily
Are you sure? Because according to you I was not even at this concert.
Rufus (phone rings): Uh, if you can answer-you-please? If this is my son, be nice!

  Lily (on phone)
Hello! Yes, here the Humphrey residence ... Yes, Yes ... Allison is Lily ... Yes, uh, second.

  Rufus (the phone)
Allison? (Person on the phone)

  Lily
You'll have to explain to him the misunderstanding.

  Rufus
Do not bother! Given this situation, I have no account to render him.

  Lily
Well, I have enough abused your hospitality.

  Rufus
I hope all this will work out.

  Lily
Yes, me too. Thank you for your babysitter! And thank you for being such a good friend.

  Rufus
Yeah. J'me am almost amused.

  Lily
Rufus Good night!

[In front of the store Eleanor Waldorf]

  Policeman
I'll have to ask you for ID Mademoiselle.

  Jenny
But I have not. I'm only 14.

  Policeman
And you're out at this hour?

  Jenny
Uh, I ...

  Policeman
What is your name?

  Jenny
Blair Waldorf J'm'appelle. The shop belongs to my mother, her name is Eleanor. I forgot my jacket at any time and she is always pissed when I forget my business. So I came back but I forgot to turn off the alarm.

  Policeman
Well, give me your number, we will contact her.

  Jenny
Oh, she is moving. She is in Paris, she returned Thursday. It is 6 hours ahead, if you want to call it. Oh, it will still sting of these attacks!

  Officer
Look, I can not let you go until you verify what you say.

  Jenny
You see that I have the keys! And then there was no forced entry.

[On the streets of New York City]

  Dan
I understand better why your brother was the trunk! I've rarely seen a place so depressing.

  Serena
And say it was designed to treat depression.

  Dan
It's great your brother, really.

  Serena
Yeah. Your sister is not bad either.

  Dan
Really? Yeah, that's true, it's true. I'm still worried about it.

  Serena
Well, it manages to be concerned about you! Listen, I saw Jenny in action and my impression is that this is not the kind of girl to do things against the sandstone.

  Dan
Yeah, I know, I know. But I do not think his vision of the evening was perfect to wear makeup like a stolen car to go wiggle in stilettos in a trendy nightclub by being hit on by traders dead drunk who give a damn about her .

  Serena
This is perhaps not his conception of the perfect evening.

  Dan
How so?

  Serena
It's normal that she wanted to be friends with girls who are in his college.

  Dan
Why? J'm'en sheet.

  Serena
Well if you had gone a quarter of the efforts it has made, we might be known earlier.

  Dan
You're not wrong!

  Serena
And therefore you would have perhaps already embraced.

  Dan
More restaurant '5 stars. More driver.

  Serena
More bars with guys who reek of cigarette and music exceeded.

  Dan
We will eventually get there.

[In the room of Eric Ostrov]

  Eric
Mom!

  Lily
Hi!

  Eric
Sorry for tonight.

  Lily
We'll talk about that tomorrow. After a good night's sleep in your bed if you agree.

  Eric
I go home?

  Lily
I hope I would get to be up darling.

  Eric
I'm not worried. In addition to my bag is ready!

[In the living room of the Waldorf]

  Jenny
Well, grabs! (Dressed in jacket and leaving the keys to the store to Blair)

  Blair
Jenny! Gosh, you're not pretending to play you! (Patting the bed next to her) J't'ai kept the best place. Sleep well, you deserved it.

  Jenny
Actually, I'm going home. But thank you for the invitation, j'me have exploded!

  Blair
How does you go home? Nobody has ever dared to do that!

  Jenny
Well, we must believe that there is a first time for everything. And I'll keep the jacket, if you do not see any downside. Well, on Monday! Lunch up the steps.

  Blair
Okay, done deal.

  Gossip Girl
It seems that Jenny Humphrey created a sensation at the sleepover B. An entry into the world as we had not seen Miss Waldorf in person!

[On the streets of New York City]
Gossip Girl (Serena and Dan kiss): We can only advise to B. to remain on guard and S. to beware of his heart! It seems that the lonely boy, he was robbed. Notice to all units! Gossip Girl.

[In a shop in New York City]

  Jenny
So you, you deliver the dresses and I take the accessories.
Seller (showing ornaments of jewels): You have chosen which one?

  Jenny
Oh, no! I'm helping Blair. I am not invited, then we'll see.
Seller (hooking him a bracelet on your wrist): See! In case.

  Jenny
Oh!

  Seller
We put it on the note of your friend.

  Jenny
Oh, uh no, no!

  Seller
The girls invited to the ball are our best customers. You will be our model of an evening and you will make us the bracelet after.
______________________________

[In the room of Blair]

  Serena
Kati told me about custom corsets, crowns, wigs ... What is this madness?

  Blair
This is a masked ball. The goal is that nobody recognizes. But I expected a little something extra for Nate tonight! It's a game, a sort of treasure hunt. It will begin with an index, which will take him to a lady of honor, which will lead to a second index ...

  Serena
Wait, wait! You got the ladies?

  Blair
If he finds me before midnight, before the masks come off, the treasure is for him!

  Serena
And what is it? (Blair a mischievous smile) Oh! Well yes, I'm stupid. Sorry.

  Blair
You know, j'me myself that after all that happened, or rather all that is past, I had to do a little effort.

  Serena
I find it very romantic B. Really. And if you do not want me to come tonight I would understand ...

  Blair
Oh, but it will not! No! You can not not be there. In fact, I want you to give the last index. Will you be my maid of honor?

  Serena
What! You really want to be me?

  Blair
I see this event as a new beginning. J'te J'lui trust and have faith.

  Serena
Well, I'd be more than honored to serve you Majesty!

  Blair
Either way you go with Dan?

[In the kitchen of Humphrey]

  Dan
A ball?
Rufus (Jenny looking package all required): You knew that your sister's name was Cinderella?

  Dan
And I bet your charming half-sister is Blair Waldorf!

  Jenny
It's true that she asked me a few services but I'm glad to help.

  Rufus
And she has to thank you with a prompt and a dress?

  Jenny
I would have deserved. The ballroom, the costumes ... it's gonna be insane! It's weird that Serena you have not mentioned.

  Dan
But why? This is not because we went out twice together we are forced to remain glued to each other.

  Jenny
Well I must deliver it all. Let me know if you need a tuxedo!
Dan (Rufus just looking at him): Well what! This is a masked ball, she must say that I will find it rather ridiculous, proving that she knows me pretty well.

[In the room of Blair]

  Serena
I know! Wait, a masked ball! I know, I know he will find it completely ridiculous. You imagine a wolf and a tuxedo, frankly?

  Blair
We adore you! To go out with you would be able to do anything. Even wearing a dress my mother if it is. And then not worry, I'm sure he has nothing planned tonight. Who would ever think to invite this guy?

  Serena
You're disgusting! I know. In fact, it might be better if there's masks, as if it y'en high school who hates it and recognize them well.

  Blair
Come on, invites Dan Humphrey. That's an order!

[In the kitchen of Humphrey]

  Dan
I did not say that I would not. Serena invites me if it would be rude not to give it my company.

  Rufus
It would be very cruel!

  Dan
But she did not invite me so ...

  Rufus
If you want to accompany him, what to do. Be a little daring.

  Dan
The festival takes place in a few hours. I have more time to really prepare myself for the idea of being bold.
Rufus (Dan's cell phone ringing): This is Serena?

  Dan
Oh no, it's Vanessa!

  Rufus
Vanessa! Been a long time. You pick right?

  Dan
But if, of course I'll win. (On phone) Hello! Vanessa?

  Vanessa (on phone)
Winner! It's me.

  Dan (on phone)
So what's new? It's going to Vermont?

  Vanessa (on phone)
You always have my book "The Crying of Lot 49"?

  Dan (on phone)
Uh ... I know.

  Vanessa (on phone)
Will you check?

  Dan (on phone)
Uh ... right! It's been over a year that has not spoken, you make me an old book ads!

[In Dan's room]

  Dan (on phone)
I know where I belong.

  Vanessa
Look at the window!

  Dan
Vanessa!

  Vanessa
Surprise!

  Dan
Wow! But I can not believe it!

  Vanessa
How are you?

  Dan
I can not believe it's great. -What are you doing here?

  Vanessa
My parents let me live with my sister that I finish my studies here.

  Dan
So that means ...

  Vanessa
I came to stay.

  Dan
Wow! It is ...

  Vanessa
A great new hope?

  Dan
Oh yes! Wait it is! Yes, of course. It is still unexpected. This is unexpected news. (His phone rings) Oh!

  Vanessa
Go pick up. I'm starving and I can smell waffles. Rufus!

  Rufus
Vanessa!

  Vanessa
Surprise!

[In the room of Dan / Blair's Bedroom]

  Dan (on phone)
Serena! Are you okay?

  Serena (on phone)
Hi! Are you okay? Uh ...

  Blair
Go go ahead.

  Serena (on phone)
Uh ... I actually wanted to know if you had anything planned tonight?

  Dan (on phone)
Uh ... Tonight? Nah, nah, nah, nothing. Why?

  Serena (on phone)
Super because I have a night, finally you will surely find it completely sucks, but ...

  Dan (on phone)
Always try.

  Vanessa
Even cooler, these waffles are screaming! The kitchen of Rufus failed me. It's true! Hey Rufus! You got whipped cream?

  Serena (on phone)
Who was that?

  Dan (on phone)
Uh ... It is my sister. What-you wanted to tell me?
Jenny (arriving in Blair's room with an armful of bags): Hi, this is me! You want me to ask it where?

  Blair
It's good, you can put it all here. (Showing a small table) I left you a different list.
Jenny (taking the list): Ah!

  Dan (on phone)
Hello! There was someone?

  Serena (on phone)
Excuse me, uh ... What?

  Dan (on phone)
Uh, you were going to ask you something.

  Serena (on phone)
No, uh ... no.

  Dan (on phone)
Are you sure?

  Serena (on phone)
No, forget it. Thank you. I must leave you.

  Dan (on phone)
Oh, okay.

  Serena (on phone)
Bye.

  Vanessa
Well, what do we do tonight?

  Serena
I need a partner!

Wow! I love New York. Y'avait cinoch one 'and they went to Woodbury as films for kids: "Babysittor" one year showing.

  Dan
Well, Vin Diesel has to be funny after all.

  Vanessa
I can not make up my mind, there's too many things. I rather prefer that you choose.

  Dan (evasively)
Yes, as you will.

  Vanessa
You, you do not want us to go to the movies? You were perhaps other projects like a wild s*x with all the rich kids of your private school waiting their inheritance wisely?

  Dan
Yeah, besides the limousine is waiting for me.

  Vanessa
Cool! We will tag the tires or even die! So, it makes you weird me being there?

  Dan
No, why? Why it would make me weird?

  Vanessa
Because. You told me some things when I'm gone.

  Dan
Things you immediately asked me to withdraw.

  Vanessa
Because j'quittais New York, but now I'm here.

  Dan
Yeah, except it's been over a year, you see. It's been a lot of things in a year.

  Vanessa
And I hope you'll tell me everything! Tonight? Last meeting? Angelica? Any chick that ...

  Vanessa & Dan
Unless sittor Baby!

  Dan
Okay, I'll book.

It's cool to see you Humphrey!

  Nate
Yes, he told me he had made the transfer of accounts. The next day, everything was normal.

  Chuck
Then why you worry? Financial transactions a bit dodgy, parents who yell at ... this is our daily lot. (A packet of drugs from the book falls into the hands of Nate) Chi Chi breaks the coconut! I'm in shock! I thought that you did not use as tea.

It's not for me.

Thank you're an angel. I do not know what I would have done without you.

  Jenny
Nah, it's nothing. I thought it was funny.

  Blair
Good! Besides that you learn things. (Seeing the bracelet Jenny) And you seem to learn fast: very pretty bracelet. Vintage, right? Diamonds seem true.

  Jenny
That's because they are. The head of the shop lent me.

  Blair
Why did he do this? (Jenny embarrassed) Oh my little Jenny! You do still not believe that you were coming tonight?

  Jenny
I was hoping for a bit, maybe ... Yeah.

  Blair
You know that the graders are not going to a masquerade, it is the rule.

  Jenny
Yeah I know but as I saw that there were five dresses ...

  Blair
Oh! This is the bare minimum. Think I do a stain or tear my dress!

  Jenny
Yeah, sure. I should remember. Have fun tonight!

  Blair
It's yes. And not be sad, your time will come, I promise! Well let j'te I must prepare myself.

Wait, me about it! In Waldorf, the theme party is perpetuated from mother to daughter.

  Lily
You're not with Dan?

  Serena
Uh ... Nah. Dan is already taken tonight.

  Lily
But by what?

  Serena
The question is: by whom?

  Lily
Han, I had not realized. In fact, to be honest, it relieves me. At your age, do not deprive themselves of papilloner.

  Serena
You can talk about you! It is your rider sexy tonight?

  Lily
What? Nah, you're kidding. Who do you want me to go! I'm going to try this dress and see if I can find a goat.

Dan (answering machine): Hi Jenny! I have a great scoop for you: Vanessa returned to New York. We will s'faire a movie tonight, so I know not if you go to the ball or not but I wanted to know if you wanted to come. So uh ... I'm gonna book it. So, call me.

I'm sorry to bother you, it's ... You got a minute?

  Serena
Yes, of course. Between.

  Nate
Thank you!

  Serena
Yes. (Nate having him tell it all) It may be an old remnant, something that dates back 80, a memory of a night at the Limelight and the Tunnel ... Our parents were more crap than us.

  Nate
This is recent. Yes, and I'm not surprised one second. I reckon my father to problems frica.

  Serena
You tried to tell him?

  Nate
Yeah. In fact that annoys me is that it makes me believe that all is well. Looks like my parents have signed a secret pact to act like robots.

  Serena
I do not think this is a secret pact if it. I think all our parents have signed it.

  Nate
It's okay, I'm more a kid. He let me stay away.

  Serena
Look, if what you believe is true, it probably should be scared. So it will take you to be a little more perseverance if you want it to really listen to you. (Nate annoyed) Hey, not give up! (Nate taking his hand) It's better that you go. I must prepare myself and all that.

  Nate
Yeah, uh ... I, too, and I thank you for listening.

  Serena
It's nothing. Yes, that's normal.

  Nate
Chuck wanted to test the merchandise and B. messaging was on so it was cool that you're here.

Okay. At any time! Ciao!

Hey! Is it-I can enter?

  Rufus
Oh, hello! You go out with Dan tonight?

  Vanessa
We're gonna get a movie. And you're going where? Humphrey in a suit and tie. Hmm, I smell a tryst but ...

  Rufus
But my wife left me.

  Vanessa
Yeah, but what-happens with Allison? Dan told me she was still in Hudson. J'croyais it was like for the summer.

  Rufus
J'le thought also.

  Vanessa
Oh, I see. We'll talk another time, it looks complex.

  Rufus
Where-I f*cked my keys?

  Vanessa
You do not need keys, the window of Dan this is simpler. Where he is anyway?

  Rufus
It will not be long in my opinion. So, uh ... Dan looked pleased to see you.

  Vanessa
Why? It surprises you?

  Rufus
Well, uh ... if I may, when you're gone, you've broken her heart.

  Vanessa
And bah I got home. I hated living away from New York, and away from Dan.

  Rufus
You told him?

  Vanessa
No, not yet. But I plan to tell her tonight, before or after the movie, I know not yet. I have found yet. It will not be obvious.

  Rufus
Yeah.

  Vanessa
Hmm ... (finding the keys to Rufus)

  Rufus
Oh! Thank you! Uh ... You know it, uh ... he spent a lot of things in your absence.

  Vanessa
Yes, that's what Dan said.

  Rufus
But you've always been close. I'm sure it'll get.

  Vanessa
Wish me luck!

  Rufus
You too!

  Vanessa
So where are you going dressed like that?

  Rufus
Oh, it's just a party.

  Vanessa
With a friend?

  Rufus
Uh ... It's not quite the word I would use. See you later!
Vanessa (his phone rings) Hello!

  Dan (on phone)
Hey, where is this-that you're in?

  Vanessa (on phone)
I'm with you.

  Dan (on phone)
Oh! Oh, you're ahead.

  Vanessa (on phone)
Yes, j'pouvais not wait.

  Dan (on phone)
Uh ... I tried to reach you before you go, I want a lot.

  Vanessa (on phone)
Because I'm ahead?

  Dan (on phone)
Nah, because, um ... I, I completely forgot that I had an essay to do for Monday so I'll work all night, but, but I rattraperais. Promised, swore!

  Vanessa (on phone)

  Lily
Rufus! Look around you. Since when you did not attend the greatest figures of our world? Enjoy it to make you understand, to revive your career faltering, for your little gallery became a place in disaster.

  Rufus
Han, you've become the patron saint of former rock stars!

  Lily
Oh yeah? You were a star? Listen, go away if you want, j't'assure. Allison would probably furious to know that you come with me this evening, even if it's in your best interest.

  Rufus
J'me care what Allison thinks.

  Lily
So much the better! I'll introduce you to our hostess. Eleanor!

  Eleanor
Ah!

  Lily
This is divine! Really, it's like to Marrakech.

  Eleanor
Oh Lily! Nan but what a surprise! I did not know if you would be in good company.

  Lily
Oh!

  Eleanor
Is not he cute!

  Rufus
I'm not ...

  Lily
It's Rufus Humphrey.

  Eleanor
It is a pleasure.

  Rufus
Enchanted.

  Lily
That's good couscous that I see there?

  Eleanor
Yes, help yourself!
Bart (accompanied by Carissa): Hi Eleanor!

  Eleanor
How are you? Miss Magic!

  Lily
Wow!

  Rufus
Have you seen anything?

  Lily
No, it's nothing. I love her dress.

  Bart
Lily!
Lily Bart!

  Bart
Good evening!

  Rufus
Hi!

  Bart
Uh, I present to you Carissa.

  Carissa
Yes, enchanted. Carissa! (Reaching for Lily)
Lily (the greeting): Hi!

  Rufus
Rufus! (Shaking hands)

  Carissa
Magic!

  Bart
Well, well, glad to have seen you.

  Lily
Yes, me too.

  Bart
Good evening.

  Lily
You too.

  Carissa
Good evening!

  Rufus
You and Bart Bass? Ah, j'comprends better! This is to make him jealous that you invited me?
Lily Han, j't'en please! This is ridiculous.

  Rufus
You know I find it pretty quite flattering actually. But you could have found better than me.

  Lily
Not in so little time.

  Howard
Eleanor! Salamalikum!

  Eleanor
Oh!

  Howard
How are you? This evening is fantastic!

  Eleanor
Thank you, you're an angel.

So basically, this girl makes you a slave?

  Jenny
Nan, her maid instead.

  Vanessa
That's what Jane Austen called slaves.

  Jenny
At the same time she ever said that I would go to the ball. I render him service or not.

  Vanessa
Hin, hin! Do not try to find excuses, after all you did you deserve to go!

  Jenny
J'croyais that you found the masked balls totally cheesy!

  Vanessa
This is only my opinion. But if you really want to go, it's not that girl that will prevent you.

  Jenny
Nothing to it, I mean, I even have a dress!

  Vanessa
I have a friend who works as a costume designer at BAM, we will pay it. What else?

  Jenny
I have no invitation.

  Vanessa
We go through the door. What else?

  Jenny
If Blair sees me she'll be furious!

  Vanessa
So this is a chance that you wear a mask.

  Jenny
Look, I know that you disapprove of worldliness to death these rich kids and all, but ...

Nah, but what does that makes Nate? He should have found Kati & Isa '! It's late and I cooled!

  Chuck
You're stunning beauty. If I was ya man, I would not need clues to find you.

  Blair
That I doubt it for a second.
Chuck (watching Jenny): Who is this chick?

  Blair
Probably the kind that embeds the tape.

  Chuck
This is the kind I like.

  Blair
Forget it! Nate go get and put it in the right direction.

  Chuck
All in good time. (Starting to see Jenny)

  Blair
Han!

  Chuck
Hi dear angel! You must be my lucky charm. (Seeing her wrist) And I have a lucky charm that has taste.

  Jenny
It seems not, since I speak with you!

  Chuck
Beautiful and cruel. Everything I love. You could dance with a poor devil?

  Jenny
We could burn this step and find a quiet corner.

  Chuck
I'll take out the champagne.

  Jenny
And I the quiet corner.

You know I adore you, this is not the problem. But you have no experience in this field. I met with counselors in Calvin and I must admit that I found remarkable presentation.

  Anne
Enough about business, you are bored our hostess. I thought of one thing when your daughter is fiancera with Nate, I would offer him the ring of my great-grandmother.

But I not spy, I just wish that's all informed.

  Serena
Ah bah yes, it looks, uh ... horrible!

  Edward
It has the.

  Serena
Uh, listen, will you apologize? I, I guess it's better than ...

  Dan
What you change your partner! Hello!

Dan! -What are you doing here?

I just help you.

I do not need to be rescued.

  Dan
Oh yes! Yet watching you, I vaguely felt that you were passing a tough time!

  Serena
Dan!

  Nate
Yes?

  Kati
B. sends us.

  Isabel
It's late and she is tired of waiting for you.

  Kati
The maid of honor is far less than you think. The fairy of pink feathers and black, it is she who will guide you. Hmm, that's it!

It's me!

What? Uh, sorry?

  Kati
You got to find Serena, she has the final index.

Serena, yes.

  Chuck

And how will you find me? I have no stones to cast.

  Jenny
Well, you can always help me by spreading your clothes.

  Chuck
I must surely be dreaming.
A guy from the ball (to Vanessa): It's going to you? (From Vanessa)

  Dan
Hey Serena! If you-like-.

  Serena
Why did you get Dan?

  Dan
Why did I come! I ran through the town, I rented a tuxedo, I stole this mask to a poor guy that was even able to stand ... I have to get tricky here, all because I want to you.

  Serena
It's not the impression I had this morning when you've lied about this girl!

  Dan
What? Wait, wait, I, I have not, well ... in fact so.

  Serena
Yeah.

  Dan
I lied but I can explain.

  Serena
Go ahead, but apply yourself.

  Dan
Well I was with my friend Vanessa. We were very close, she moved here last year and she has just returned.

  Serena
So, why is it that you told me that it was Jenny?

  Dan
Because I'm stupid! I do not know, I know why. Vanessa and I were there ..., there are reports that are a bit complicated. Finally, who were. And then I met you, you. To be honest, somewhere, I was secretly hoping you would ask me this stupid masquerade.

  Serena
Well, I planned to invite you.

  Dan
Yeah? You're telling me that you will not marry this pretentious snob?

  Serena
You're telling me that between you and Vanessa it's over?

  Dan
That's exactly what I say.

  Gossip Girl
Oh yes! It is by far my favorite part of the ball! When the masks come off and the truth comes out for all to see. (Vanessa attends the scene)

  Dan
You'll excuse me? This is the last person I expected to see here.

  Serena
Yes, how not to follow!

  Dan
Excuse me! Vanessa, Vanessa! Hey! I was not expecting to see you here.

  Vanessa
It's funny, I was gonna say the same thing.

  Dan
What, are you doing here?

  Vanessa
J'travaille on my dissert 'for Monday. Oh, oh no, it's you! J'confonds. Since when we lie to each other?

  Dan
Nah, that's not it. I simply failed to tell you the truth. Which is a lie even worse than the other makes.

  Vanessa
Humphrey!

  Dan
I did not understand either. I am a little confused. And what-you wanted me to say? I went to go rent a tuxedo at a masquerade ball when I had neither masks nor invitation, all that to go find a girl that she had a mask, an invitation, and a jumper!

  Vanessa
It would have been honest.

  Dan
You hate this environment!

  Vanessa
You too. Finally, this is what I thought.

  Dan
I do not understand, uh ... we need you to explain. You've followed so far to prove that I am a liar?

  Vanessa
Yes, Dan! That's why I'm here. I've tracked down so far because I am completely obsessed with you, and then there is this time that's why I came back to New York because I was just thinking about you day and night !

  Dan
OK, I understand, you can stop.

  Vanessa
It's going, do not worry, j'me breaks. Hello!

  Dan
Wait, wait! If you-like-, wait! Listen, I want. I want to have you lied about tonight.

  Vanessa
You said you loved me.

  Dan
That's, that was before you leave. I was a prepubescent teen when I told you that. Since there are many things that have changed.

  Vanessa
I see it! You do not do things by half, anyway. (Hence)

  Serena
So that's ...

  Dan
Vanessa, yeah. It is ...

  Serena
Super nice.

  Dan
I gotta go, excuse me!

[On the roof of the ballroom masked]

  Chuck
You heaters! I'm getting closer.

  Jenny
I found your pants!

  Chuck
Then you burned. I'll eventually catch fire me if you continue like that.

  Jenny
Do not worry, you will not be long before you cool!

  Chuck
Yeah? -What do you mean by that? (Jenny key to closing the door) Hey what the hell was that! Hey! My laptop is in my fute! I'm stuck here poor idiot.

[Before the ballroom masked]

  Dan
Vanessa! Vanessa, wait-if you please! But why not wait for me, huh? (Calling out a girl like Vanessa) Oh! Because you are not Vanessa, sorry. I'm sorry, simple mistaken identity. Congratulations Dan! She even wears no mask.

Yes. How to say, j'me sense ...

  Rufus
Nostalgic.

  Lily
nauseous.

  Rufus
Okay. Whew!

  Lily
Nan, j'te Charie. Whatever, I'm sorry but I have Rufus, then I would perhaps not have to invite you here.

  Rufus
I see, uh ... As for me I'm sorry to have kissed but I did it out of devotion for that idiot playboy realizes how much you're more attractive than his pretty young conquest. The freshness of youth passes, whatever I have to admit that you escape completely to this rule. Ultimately, he would bite his fingers. And I thought he deserved to know what it is losing you. I know how hard it is.
Lily (seeing approaching Bart): I think it worked.

  Bart
Lily, I can talk to you a moment? If you let it.
Rufus (seeing Lily and Bart away): Wow! Do not thank me.

What is happening Lily? Why do not you say anything? This is serious ...

  Lily
It does not concern you.

  Serena
Yes, do not worry about that. There are lots of things I'll try to remember to have seen tonight.

  Jenny
It's not going to air.

  Serena
I do not know. Dan gave me a surprise coming.

  Jenny
Ah bah it's great!

  Serena
Yes, except that I was even more surprised when I saw him run after a girl named Vanessa.

  Jenny
Nah, it's her best friend!

  Serena
Yes, bah it looks to be a bit more than that. Tell me there was something between them?

  Jenny
I reckon. Finally, yeah. But Dan never liked a girl like he loves you. The proof: he came to a masked ball. I reckon he would be willing to go anywhere with you. Except perhaps to "Holiday on Ice" is one of her worst childhood memories!

  Serena
You know, I guess I should go find him. Except that it will not be easy to find someone with that stupid mask that is not in place.

  Jenny
I Want you spin well but mine is better that I stay hidden if I want out of here incognito.

  Serena
We exchange if you want?

  Jenny
Okay.

  Serena
Thank you. Oh! (Giving him his vest) And I want you file it. It's so hot here, and you risk being cold if you go out, like. You've had fun tonight?

  Jenny
It could not be better!

  Serena
Great!
Jenny (standing out hair): Okay!
Serena (handing him the hair in place): Wait!

  Jenny
Thank you.

  Serena
Very nice.

[In the ballroom masked]

  Nate
Serena says nothing in particular, let me explain.

  Jenny
Oh sh1t!

  Nate
Look, I tried to reason with me, but I can not. I know that every two to Blair but still I'm gonna have to tell him the truth. I only think of you. I tried to forget you but I am unable. If you do not stop me I'll kiss you.

  Serena
Nate!
Nate (Jenny escaping): But ...

  Serena
But what-are you doing? Should you find Blair. Well, never mind we drop clues, she wears thigh boots and a large golden tiara. Go go! Hurry.

  Blair
Serena, do-Have you seen Nate? (Jenny escaping from his grip) Hey! (Grabbing the wrist of Jenny)

  Everyone
5,4,3 ...

  Blair
Jenny.

  Everyone
2.1 ...

  Kati & Isabel
It's midnight! The mask off!

  Dan
Serena! (Jenny escaping) Serena, Serena! Wait, wait! I'm sorry, Sere ...

[Before the ballroom masked]

  Chuck
Little Jenny Humphrey was able to put my ass in the air without my taking the fun! I must say it is an achievement.

  Blair
Fortunately another s*x maniac came on the roof, otherwise you'll always be there. And no, I do not know what you did to have this Tuxedo. Come on, I go.

  Nate
Hi Chuck! See you tomorrow.

  Blair
Hin, hin! You did not find before midnight, the evening ends there for you.

  Nate
Look, I'm, I'm sorry.

  Blair
All I wanted was that reparte zero. And you have not even tried.
A guy from the ball (with Kati & Isabel): It's going girls?

  Chuck
Well at least there is one who spends a good evening.

  Serena (on phone)
Hello!

  Dan (on phone)
Serena! Do-you can at least tell me if-you-please? Why did you run away like that?

  Serena (on phone)
What are you talking about? It is you who have fled.

  Dan (on phone)
Uh, I think not. A beautiful blonde with a yellow dress and a fur vest, there is one and Serena Van Der Woodsen.

  Serena
Nah, not tonight.

  Dan
Well, for information you must know that I like you. You and only you.

  Serena
And well it's cool because I feel the same.

  Dan
That's settled.

  Serena
Well ... It seems that "Holiday on Ice" It will stop in New York.

  Dan
Oh! If you want to go, so I want to go.

[In the office of Howard]

  Nate
Hey! You are still standing!

  Howard
We are celebrating something.
Anne Eleanor Waldorf has accepted the company of your father takes care of its IPO.

  Nate
Great! It's a new superb.

  Anne
Yes, indeed. So I went to get something to open this bottle were kept for a special occasion. (Showing the bag of drugs) And that's how I found this. So what? Can you tell me what's it doing there?

  Nate
How so?

  Anne
Well, it's not me, it's not your father either. And since we are only three in this house ...
______________________________

[In Jenny's room]

  Dan
Hey! We do not sleep?

  Jenny
I'm not tired.

  Dan
Oh! I'm completely exhausted. You know I went to the ball after all!

  Jenny
Oh, really?

  Dan
Yeah.

  Jenny
Your evening is complete. There's someone for you.

[In Dan's room]

  Vanessa
A pierogi? I came in peace.

  Dan
So much the better because I'm starving. Listen, ...

  Vanessa
Forget Humphrey! Do not pretend to be embarrassed, you look not. Anyway, it is I who owe you an apology.

  Dan
Nope not at all, it's me. I should tell you about Serena.

  Vanessa
I should have been more curious.

  Dan
And I should not have to lie to you tonight.

  Vanessa
And I should not have run away so fast. Well, if you want us to be friends as before, we will have to rule certain things.

  Dan
You're right. It made me miss having a girlfriend.

  Vanessa
And I missed it to be one. Trying to focus on the essentials.

  Dan
Like what? Less bullshit and more pierogi?

  Vanessa
And you make me a summary of everything I missed. Serena kind ...

  Dan
It's good! It is almost as fabulous as these pierogi! The only concern is that she has a mother, you see a little goofy, which I do not gifts. And then there's also her best friend with whom I have great difficulty, but so much evil. But the worst is when there's the boyfriend of her best friend, well then it gets complicated. Because they went out together ...

  Vanessa
Oh yeah?

  Dan
Actually, he was in love with her best friend too ...
gossip girl here--your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
you'll never believe what's on "gossip girl.
" someone saw serena getting off a train at grand central.
i thought everything was good between us.
it was, before i found out you had s*x with my boyfriend.
i didn't come back for you.
look, blair's my best friend, and you're her boyfriend, and she loves you.
you'd really go out with some guy you don't know? well, you can't be worse than the guys i do know.
this party is for you.
okay, so you can meet people, become a part of something.
nathaniel i'm shocked.
i thought you were strictly an herbal man.
this isn't mine.
which is how i found this.
it isn't mine, and it isn't your father's.
what do you have to say for yourself, nate? you said you love me.
loved you.
i'm sorry i kissed you, but i did it because i thought he should know how it feels to lose you.
i like you, only you.
that's good because i feel the same about you.
the masks come off at midnight, and i kind of need my disguise.
you know what? you wanna trade? sure.
serena, i know we both care about blair, but maybe the best thing is for me to just tell her the truth.
i'm not over you.
oh! nate? serena.
hey! have you seen nate? jenny.
have you heard, upper east siders? burlesque is all the rage again, and sometimes a little raging is exactly what you need.
and as always, chuck's aiming to be ahead of the curves.
who's that girl? i have no idea.
but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
 - you want your dad to invest in a strip joint? how midtown.
a burlesque club-- a respectable place where people can be transported to another time, where they can feel free to let loose.
no judgment.
pure escape.
what happens at victrola stays at victrola.
well, it does have franchise potential.
chuck bass, i do believe all your years of underage boozing truly, i am proud.
and you are my toughest critic.
well, second toughest.
so do you think your father will go for it? it is exactly the kind of innovative thinking upon which the bass empire was built.
it is the perfect thing.
i've been waiting for this.
we are so late.
gotta pitch it to bart.
victory party here tomorrow.
i wouldn't miss it.
i'll send a car.
don't be nervous.
he's gonna love it.
they all seem very discreet.
it's up to you, but you will choose a facility, and you will get the help that you need, after our dinner unless you'd like to ruin the celebration honoring anne, it's all right.
let me talk to him.
how could you not tell her the drugs were yours? you're not gonna end up in one of these places.
let me talk to her.
you know how your mother overreacts.
yeah, 'cause it's mom who's the problem, right? look, work's been kicking my ass lately.
the old man doesn't wear the hours as well as he used to.
this young viper at the office, frank meltzer, saw me fading one night, so he offered me a pick-me-up.
it was stupid.
i didn't even like it.
hey, i'll flush the bag right now, all right? dad, i just want you to be-- look, let's not put a damper on the upcoming festivities.
i've landed the waldorf account, and my son has landed the waldorf.
so that's it? hey, i'm not cutting the conversation short.
drinks after school at the club? nonalcoholic, of course.
no, you don't understand, vanessa.
okay, the store lent it to me for the ball, and if i don't find it, blair is gonna kill me.
it's under her name, and she doesn't even know i went.
no, alison, i sent that two weeks ago.
dad, have you seen a bracelet? you know, round, silverish, sparkly? yeah, i think i saw that next to that ambiguous vague thing by the nondescript place.
he hasn't seen it.
no, alison, i-wh--i haven't told them anything yet.
well, what should i be telling them when i don't even know what's who you talking to? your mother.
tell her i say hi.
jenny says hello.
who are you talking to? where's the other humphrey? ow.
brick not comfortable.
all right, i'll take one for the team.
ooh! yeah, this is definitely not very comfortable.
i know.
you'd think all the money that we spent on this private school, they could at least or a better chemistry teacher.
mr.
peiser is a little weird.
wait, you're thinking about mr.
peiser right now? we are at school.
hey, serena.
ugh.
why don't you get a room? oh, that's the plight of the manhattan teenager.
no cars.
you know, we could find a place more private.
our parents aren't always home.
that's true.
they must eventually leave.
the problem is waiting for eventually.
what's the rush? really, it's not like this sucks.
minus the brick and the paparazzi.
spotted-- serena and not-so-lonely boy clearly past courtship in the courtyard.
bye.
you know, we should talk about this, though, about us, about eventually.
definitely.
yes.
or we could just get it over with in a broom closet.
in a broom closet? that is-- that is rich, serena.
mr.
peiser's waiting.
but can brooklyn keep up with the uptown express? oh.
serena, right? uh, that's funny.
mm, not really.
no.
no.
uh, what are you doing in the girls' hall? i was actually looking for you.
you know, i really didn't mean anything i said about having feelings for serena.
maybe you didn't.
i just-- i mean, i don't even care, but other people might.
yeah, i know.
yeah, including my brother.
you brought me chocolates? well, i know you care about being friends with blair, and your brother-- he's with serena, and i just really need you to help me out here.
you promise? promise what? uh, promise to help me oh.
i'm sorry for taking you for granted lately, okay? that is so sweet! but i prefer the gold collection, but thank you.
hey, cinderella.
i think you dropped this at the ball.
i hate secrets more than anything.
you know that.
friends don't lie, and we're friends, right? right.
jenny humphrey's rise to the penthouse but if she crosses blair waldorf, it's straight back to the basement.
looks like this little lamb needs to stay silent or else.
when can i go public with you? my kids have to know first.
well, your secret's safe with me.
father.
chuck.
um, well bart, um, i think your points earlier were excellent mm-hmm.
and, um, i plan to bring them up at the next parent/teacher meeting.
um, thank you, lily.
not much future as an actress.
you don't say anything to serena.
you don't say anything to anyone.
lily would like this to play out in a certain way.
so you're serious about her? what's with the business formal? are you being arraigned for something? i have an investment idea i think is utterly unique to your company.
something avant-garde, yet nostalgic.
it is the perfect way for you like you've been wanting, sir.
i am so pleased.
you are? are you kidding me? do you how long i've been waiting for you to be interested in something other than partying? you should come see the place.
it sells itself.
i have some meetings, but, uh, how's after-- a-after's--after's great.
after's good.
so i heard on "gossip girl" that you were having s*x with dan out here in streaming video.
ugh! god, kati and is filmed us? oh, it's all very and no, they haven't streamed it yet, but i heard it was aggressive.
i must say, dan has been surprisingly good at everything we've done.
which is everything? no! but feel free to ask any personal questions.
but you've talked about it, right? no, mom, we haven't.
may i remind you that this is your first real boyfriend, s.
, and in relationships, you talk about stuff.
i know, but i don't know, sometimes talking about it i would know.
well, as long as you're not worried.
well, i'm not, but i don't know, he might be.
is it possible for a guy to want to slow things down? only the guys we like.
but with you, i can't imagine why.
how was i? i don't know.
let's ask the judges.
hmm.
i was gonna give you a 3, but since you're a virgin, i gave you an extra point.
hey, i chose to wait.
s*x is meaningful, like art, and you don't rush art.
who's art? did you sleep with him? did you sleep with him? did you or did you not sleep with him? yes, alison, i did encourage you to do your paintings, not the next door neighbor.
hello? hello? ah, dan, i-i didn't realize you were home.
i'm sorry you had to hear that.
well, i did.
something about, uh, uh, mom and a neighbor? yeah, it's complicated.
mom's having an affair.
it's easy when you just say it.
not to your son.
well, she hasn't exactly been rushing back to us.
it's good to know why.
i'm home.
what's going on, dad? uh, nothing.
just gotta get some groceries.
dan? uh, sorry, jen.
i got a lot of homework, so ey, dad.
i'm, like, ten blocks away.
what? oh, sorry, nate.
i have to take a rain check on our drink.
why? client in crisis.
can't get out of the office, but i'll be home as soon as i can.
well, dad, our talk was kind of important.
it's business, nate.
you understand, right? we'll talk later.
looks like parents can be deceiving n both sides of the bridge.
you are really talented.
dad.
i, uh, ahem.
i didn't think you'd make it.
and you want me to pour hundreds of thousands of dollars into an excuse for you to be around booze and women? no.
no, i did you read the proposal? it shows a much bigger picture.
i came down here because i saw the effort you made.
you want to impress me with your commitment to something? try getting a few a's in school or maybe a part-time job.
s like the pot calling the kettle black and if we know chuck, he's not one to let things lie.
someone pour that man a drink.
you need to look elegant for the archibald dinner tomorrow night, so what do you think? yes, it would be very nice, if i was sailing up on the mayflower.
anne archibald was wearing her amazing cornelius vanderbilt diamond ring the other night.
she was going on and on about how it would end up on your finger wait.
nate spoke to his mother about our future? he actually asked for the family ring? oks like cold, hard cash an get you the cold, rd truth.
didn't anyone tell you, n.
? be careful what you fish for.
can't believe we actually got the apartment to ourselves.
you got downtown pretty fast.
well, with an opportunity like this, one needs to take advantage.
mmm.
how long do you think ill your dad and sister will be back? uh, anywhere from an hour to 20 minutes? well, 20 minutes is plenty.
it's kind of bright in here, don't you think? mm, how about next time? (vanessa) hey, dan.
hungry? hello.
hi.
hi.
vanessa, right? good to see you.
good to see you.
and good to see you seeing us seeing you.
excuse me.
you really need to start using that door.
which you're showing me to.
well, practice makes perfect.
leaving, out the door.
and we appreciate it.
orry.
so do you think we should talk about it? oh.
you mean about-- about vanessa? no, you know what? she's like family.
it feels comfortable, and so therefore, she often shows up without calling.
no, i-i mean about what almost, maybe, might have just happened.
oh, you mean if vanessa hadn't entered, and we or we could not talk about it.
dan, we're home.
we got breakfast.
hungry? spotted-- bass drunk off his ass t the palace bar, drinking away his woes and investment capital.
nathaniel, your position in my esteem has been replaced by your voice mail.
so bart didn't go for victrola, but truth is i bought the house out already for tonight, and it's not a par-tay without my people r any people.
i'll see you there.
long night? alfonso made me an omelet.
i may have washed it down with a bellini or two.
you father didn't go for your business proposal.
come on.
he was born poor.
i was born loaded.
yeah.
but if the only way to impress him is if i started with nothing, then why doesn't he just take it all away? because he loves you.
no good parent likes to see his child go without.
i had the idea.
i did the work.
he tells me i can't be committed, and he's the one screwing 25 year olds when he's supposedly committed to you.
we're newly committed, as recent as last week.
i wonder why he was pawing some asian chick n his limo yesterday.
how could i be surprised, really? i'm on my way.
uh, i'm late for my blowout at arden's.
mom, please.
the drugs were dad's.
i mean, i guess he thought it'd be easier on everyone if i took the hit, but they were his.
i don't understand.
no, he promised me he'd flush the coke, then i caught him buying more.
the lengths that you will go to to get out of trouble, nate.
mom, he has a problem.
i need your help, please.
you look down at the floor every time someone tries to tell you the truth.
just look at me.
mom.
i saw dad buying drugs yesterday.
he's been under a lot of pressure, and if you hadn't been so difficult lately what? your latest rebellions have been very hard on your father, nate.
all this business with dartmouth, your issues with blair.
mom, dad needs your help.
not another word of this.
we have a celebratory dinner to get to.
please wear a tie.
see you curl your fingers into a fist, and with simple thrust of force, you knock on the door.
hey, i didn't use the fire escape.
baby steps.
and what are you doing watching p0rn? it's not p0rn.
it's art cinema.
oh, from what i saw earlier, you don't need to be doing research.
i can't talk about this with you.
i'm curious, though, about the change in your attitude, because may i remind you, that in your pale, romantic, tortured days, you'd wax on, and i quote, that, "s*x is meaningful, like art, and you don't rush art.
" that was in, uh, 2005.
i was more idealistic then.
i was much younger, and there wasn't an actual girl who wanted to have s*x with me.
you're going to lose your virginity.
ooh, can you my friend dan.
please not turn my s*x life into a country song? it's okay.
i'm sure serena knows what to do, what with her vast experiences with boarding school professors, pamplonian bullfighters, best friends' boyfriends that's enough now.
you can go.
please.
but if it were me with you i'd want you to hide cedric, maybe get some candles and replace the football sheets.
but take it or leave it.
thanks.
i didn't know a broken clasp could cost that much.
oh, it was my pleasure.
oh, wait.
no, it wasn't.
game recognizes game, little j.
, but you have to show more respect.
this is the last time i've helped you.
next time you cross me, i won't be as forgiving.
don't worry.
there won't be a next time.
good, 'cause i wanna tell you something, something nobody knows, not even serena.
you can keep a secret, right? of course.
nate is planning on giving me his family diamond.
it's the most incredible ring you've ever seen.
uh, ring as in engagement ring? i remember the first time i ever saw him.
maybe we were just little kids, but i knew-- he's the one i wanna marry.
now it seems like he feels the same way, too.
why are you not happy for me? i'm sorry.
it's--it's just been a really weird week.
um, there's this stuff with my parents and my family, so maybe i should just go.
no, maybe you should look at me in the eye and tell me what you're hiding.
e you jealous? of you and nate? do you like him? what? no.
do you think because you talked to him once in the hall that you might have a shot? blair, it's nothing like that.
then tell me, what is it like? i don't want to hurt you.
how could you hurt me? yesterday wasn't the first time i talked to nate.
at the ball, he told me he wasn't over serena.
why would he tell you that? cause i was wearing her mask, and he thought i was her.
he kissed me.
that's enough.
blair, i-i didn't want you to find out.
you're dismissed, jenny for good.
you look beautiful tonight.
anything on your mind? no.
is there anything you wanna say? no.
the leg wrap-- that's interesting.
sexy, right? and it increases stability.
mm-hmm.
sure.
yeah, i can see that.
he hair grab-- does that really work? oh, yeah.
every time.
okay, so leg wrap to hair grab.
do hold on a second.
do--do i have to keep my shirt open and billowing like that? well, it never hurts.
nice.
i'm--i'm doomed.
"sensuous massage.
" something we should talk about? oh, uh, no.
you know, i have a lot of-- a lot of tension, stress in between my, um, shoulder blades.
so i'm headed to the gallery to, uh, test run a 24-hour projection installation.
vanessa and jenny are over there.
do you want to come? um, 24 hours is a very long time to be working straight.
so i think i might just chill here.
alone? on a saturday night? with your new girlfriend? son dad, we've had the talk already.
do you need a refresher? etched in my brain.
thanks.
well, just be safe.
don't do anything you're not ready to do--or she's not.
oh, and, uh, lose the football sheets and cedric.
well, you look pretty good for a dead messenger.
i thought i was doing the right thing.
you did.
now blair knows the truth, and she and nate can talk about it.
honest communication is what every good relationship is based on, at least, that's what i hear.
i just--i think how i'd feel, you know, if i loved someone, and they betrayed me.
how would you ever get things back to the way they were? wait, are we still talking about blair and nate here? yeah, of course.
what else can we be talking about? i don't know.
your parents? look, maybe you don't go back, maybe you go forward.
get two people in a room willing to be balls-out honest? it might get ugly, but eventually, the dust has to settle, and then you can see if there's hope.
we've celebrated the partnership, but i don't think we've given eleanor her just due.
this lady is fantastic.
oh, well, uh, thank you, howard.
more cheese? have you tried the humboldt fog? it's quite good.
eleanor's right.
enough business talk.
right.
let's focus on our families' other joint venture-the union of our children.
i have to say, every time i look at anne's finger and see blair's future engagement ring yes.
i can hardly contain my joy.
blair, why don't you try it on? no, thank you.
it's all right.
yes, i would like to see it.
anne, give it to blair.
dad, she doesn't want to try on the ring.
howie,why don't we just let it alone? just give it to the girl, anne.
eleanor, do we have another bottle? if there was ever an occasion for the toast, this is it.
they're gonna make such a beautiful couple.
now come on.
slide that thing on.
that's what i'm talking about, huh? oh, it's very pretty.
it looks magnificent to me.
thank you.
everybody, yeah? yeah? it's perfect on her.
oh, now how about that toast? come on.
everybody, bottoms up.
dad, why don't we go smoke the cigars we got, huh? mm, mm.
good idea.
excuse us.
certainly.
this seat taken? father.
wow.
the light of day doesn't do this place any justice.
i told him he had to check it out when the joint was in full swing.
chuck, this is pauletta cho.
chuck bass.
pleasure.
all mine.
pauletta interviewed me for that recent piece in "the observer," roped me into a lunch yesterday to pitch me on the idea of helping her with a career change.
what can i say? i'm tired of reporting on titans.
i wanna be one myself.
right.
well, uh, who better to help than my father? as a test, i gave her your proposal that i was given to take a look at.
the math was fine, but what interested me was the wish fulfillment quality to the report.
so perhaps, some, uh, old-school thinking and fatherly bias clouded my judgment.
what do you say? hmm? i love the idea of being a patron of burgeoning talent.
shall we take a full tour? yeah.
you know, i've been trying to get ahold of lily, but, uh, i don't seem able to.
uh, dad.
there's something i have to tell you.
dad, you have a problem.
i don't have a problem.
you're tweaked and embarrassing.
you're trying to tell me you don't have a problem? don't be so dramatic.
no, you reminded me every day how important this business deal is to you.
i mean, you've been selling me out trying to make it happen, pushing me towards dartmouth, towards blair.
you don't understand.
dad, you're totally sabotaging all of it tonight.
hey, who the hell are you to tell me? i'm the adult.
you're the kid.
i know.
i'm going back inside.
dad, don't.
nate, let go of me.
what's going on here? nothing.
he's my son.
is everything all right? i said everything's fine.
i'm not asking you.
sorry, dad.
you need help.
check his pockets while you're at it.
all right, sir, just relax.
my father went home sick.
spotted on 5th avenue-- a father and son showdown.
too bad not all the witnesses can be bought off.
she's not taking my calls.
i can't believe you did this.
i made a mistake.
this isn't high school, chuck.
i'm sure she'll take you back once you explain.
i'm not so certain about that.
if she doesn't, i'm not sure that's my fault.
there's a reason she was so quick to believe me.
there's a fire-eater in the ladies lounge.
you two should set a meeting, see if this place can really be something.
i'm gonna try and find lily and fix this.
what are you doing? i'm going to victrola.
i promised chuck.
it's important to him.
i saw your father get arrested.
why didn't you come to me? i would've listened.
i've tried, blair.
but every time i try, something's got your attention-- a dinner party, you know, a masked ball.
yeah, let's talk about that masked ball.
let's talk about how while i was waiting for you to find me so that we could finally be together, you were confessing your feelings nd kissing serena.
i thought i was doing everything right.
it's not your fault.
do you love me? you should deal with your father.
he needs you.
you know what? i don't.
okay, i'm ready.
may i? i know it may not compare to, uh, a suite at the ritz in paris or a chalet in aspen, and it might be a fire hazard, but it's perfect.

i'm sorry i bothered you, really.
l, wait.

  Gossip Girl
According To The Catholic Church, Mortal Sin Can Only Be Absolved Through The Sacred Act Of Confession, But It Looks Like A Certain W.A.S.P. Princess Has Recently Found Herself Desperately In Need Of A Little Unburdening. And Who Is The Man Upstairs To Discriminate?

[IN THE CHURCH]

  Blair
Forgive Me, Father, For I Have Sinned. It's Been... A While Since My Last Confession. For Exactly 20 Minutes, I... Succumbed To Inebriation,

  The Priest
What Troubles You, My Child?

  Blair
After Being Broken Up With My Boyfriend For Exactly 20 Minutes, I... Succumbed To Inebriation, Performed At A Speakeasy And Surrendered My Virtue To A Self-Absorbed Ass. The Only Good News Is That He's A Total Pig Who Will Act Like It Never Happened. Thank God. Ahem.

  The Priest
Hum Hum.

  Blair
Sorry. Truthfully, I'm Not Even Catholic.

  The Priest
You Don't Say.

  Blair
But Losing My Virginity To Chuck Bass ? None Of My Friends Will Ever Understand. I'm Ready For My Punishment. Whatever You And God Think Is Fair- Flogging, Fasting, Putting That Thing With The Teeth Around My Thigh, Like Silas.

  The Priest
How About Some Food For Thought Instead ? Don't Drink. Keep Your Clothes On. Try Avoiding Those Who Might Cause You To Stray.

  Blair
Oh, I Plan To. Thank You, Father. It Was Very Good Advice. You Don't Grant Birthday Wishes, Do You ?

  The Priest
I'm A Priest, Not A Genie.

  Blair
Well, The Next Time You Talk To Him, Would You Ask Him To Send My Boyfriend Back To Me?

[RESTAURANT]

  Serena
Mm. I Gotta Say...

  Dan
No Need To Say Anything.

  Waitress
God, I Hate People In Love.

  Vanessa
Wow ! Awkward.

  Dan
Vanessa ?!

  Serena
Serena. Dan ?

  Dan
NNo, No, No, No, No, No. Vanessa's Here !

  Waitress
Ah. Lovebirds Ready To Order ?

  Vanessa
Oh, I'll Take 'Em. Hi.

  Dan
Hi. So, Uh, You-You Work Here Now ?

  Vanessa
I Did Mention That, But You've Been Distracted. Vanessa. Hi. Nice To See You.

  Serena
This Time You're Seeing Less Of Me.

  Vanessa
Sorry About That. Walking In When You Were, You Know...

  Serena
Yeah.

  Vanessa
So You Guys Are Up Early. What'd You Do Last Night ?... Oh, My God. I Totally Didn't Mean To Pry.

  Dan
You're Not Prying.

  Serena
Why Would You Think You're Prying ?

  Dan and Vanessa
No Reason.

  Serena
Did You Tell Her ?

  Dan
What ? No. What's To Tell ?

  Vanessa
I Know Nothing, But If You Guys Did The Thing I Know Nothing About, Then I Would Totally Support That.

  Dan
Thanks, Vanessa. Good To Know In The Event That Should Happen.

  Vanessa
Oh, Meaning It Didn't Happen ?

  Dan
Meaning I Don't Even Know What We're Talking About Right Now.

  Serena
I Know I'm Lost.

  Vanessa
And I Should Get Lost. First Day. I Have Lots Of Tables.

  Dan
Clearly. So Vanessa Works Here Now.

  Serena
Yeah, We Should Make This Our Regular Spot.

[ON THE STREETS]

  Chuck
Well,This Is The Last Place I'd Expect To Find You.

  Blair
Go Away,Chuck. I've Been Given Orders. Practically From God Himself To Avoid You.

  Chuck
Would You Consider Avoiding Me Over Breakfast?

  Blair
Sorry, But As Is Tradition On The Day Before My Birthday, I'm Heading To The Jeweler's to Put Some Pieces On Hold For Eleanor And...

  Chuck
Nate ? Oh, I Don't Think Nate ? He'll Be Singing "Happy Birthday" This Year.

  Blair
No One Knows That Nate And I Broke Up, And It's Gonna Stay That Way So I Can Fix This, And I Don't Think Your Best Friend Would Still Be Your Best Friend If He Knew

  Chuck
If He Knew How Much I Enjoyed The Removal Of A Certain Chastity Belt In The Back Of This Very Limo ?

  Blair
From This Moment Forward, The Events Of Last Night Will Never Be Mentioned Again. Is That Clear?

  Chuck
Not As Clear As The Memory Of You Purring In My Ear, Which I Have Been Replaying Over And Over.

  Blair
Well,Erase The Tape, Because As Far As I'm Concerned, It Never Happened.

  Chuck
I'll See You At Your Party Tonight.

  Blair
You're Officially Uninvited.

  Chuck
Never Stopped Me Before.

  Gossip Girl
Speak Of The Devil, And He Doth Appear, Wearing His Trademark Scarf. Careful,B. Hell Hath No Fury Like A Chuck Bass Scorned.

[IN THE LIVING ROOM OF THE HUMPHREY]

  Jenny
Hey,Dad.

  Rufus
Hi, Honey. How Was Hudson ? Your Mother Must Have Been Kind Of Surprised To See You.

  Allison
Yeah, She Was.
...

  Allison
Hi, Rufus.

  Rufus
Alison. What Are You Doing Here ?

  Jenny
Well, I Asked Her To Come. You Know, I Thought You Guys Could... Talk... Or Not. Okay, Dad, I Know It Wasn't My Place To Ask Mom To Come Back...

  Rufus
Jenny...

  Jenny
It's Your Life. I Get That, But It's My Life, Too, And It's Dan's, And I Just Felt That Nothing's Ever Gonna Change If Someone Doesn't Do Something.

  Rufus
Jenny ! Stop. Breathe. I'm Not Angry.

  Jenny
You're Not ?

  Rufus
Not At You.

  Jenny
While You Can't Get Un-Angry At Mom If She's In Hudson, And You're Here, Dad. I Mean, Nothing's Ever Gonna Change If You're Not In The Same Room. Can't You Just Give It A Chance ?

  Rufus
...Not On An Empty Stomach. Come. I'll Make Us Breakfast.

  Allison
Who Wants Waffles ? I Mean, You Do Still Like Waffles, Right, Rufus ?

  Rufus
You Know Me, Al. I'm A Loyal Guy. Once I Commit To Something, I Stick With It.

  Allison
...

  Jenny
I'll Get The Syrup.

[IN THE LIVING ROOM OF THE WALDORF]

  Blair
Hey, Mom. I Just Got Back From The Jeweler's, And I Have To Say...

  Eleanor
Have You Seen This ?

  Blair
Since When Does Drunk And Disorderly Get This Much Attention ?

  Eleanor
Since Never. The Captain Is Being Charged With Embezzlement And Fraud. This Is An Absolute Disaster.

  Blair
It Must Be Awful For Them.

  Eleanor
I Meant For Me. The Captain Is Supposed To Represent Me. The Contracts Are About To Be Signed. What About My I.P.O., Huh ? What Is Gonna Happen To My Bendel's Deal ?

  Blair
Nate Looks So Helpless.

  Eleanor
I Have To Call My Attorney. I Have To Put An End To This Deal Before It Goes Any Further.

  Blair
I Have To Talk To Nate.

[IN THE LIVING ROOM OF THE ARCHIBALD]

  Howard
I Don't Know Why Everybody's Making Such A Big Deal Out Of This. It's Just A Misunderstanding. It'll Be Cleared Up In Time.

  Lawyer
Yes, It Will, At Your Trial. This Is Real, Howard. The Only Reason You're
Not Behind Bars Right Now Is Because Your Wife Could Afford Your Bail.

  Anne
And I Would've Paid Ten Times That Amount. You're Not Going To Jail.

  Lawyer
And We're Gonna Do Everything We Can To Make Sure That Doesn't Happen, But In The Meantime, This Is Not Something To Be Cavalier About.

  Howard
It's Clearly A Setup. Someone's Got A Agenda.

  Nate
Dad, Would You Just Shut Up And Listen To Him ?

  Anne
Nate !

  Nate
Look, Sir, What Exactly Do We Need To Do Here ?

  Lawyer
Remain Calm And Give Them Nothing But A United Front As We Fight This.

  Nate
Well, What About Some Sort Of, Um, Some Sort Of Plea ?

  Howard
A Plea ? You Think I'm Guilty ?

  Nate
Dad, It's Just A Question. How Would That Work Exactly ?

  Howard
It Wouldn't.

  Anne
Nate, I'm Sure You're Very Tired, And This Is A Conversation For Adults. Why Don't You Go Get Some Rest, Sweetheart ?

[IN THE LIVING ROOM OF THE HUMPHREY]

  Dan
Hey, Dad. Jenny. And... And Mom.

  Allison
Hi, Honey.

  Dan
Well, Look At This. The Whole Family's Together... Eating Waffles.

  Jenny
Want One ?

  Dan
You Bet. Just One Question. Am I The Only One Who Thinks This Is Extremely Weird ? I... I Mean, Given Everything.

  Jenny
Dan, Just Forget About It. If Dad Can Let It Go, So Can You.

  Rufus
What Do You Mean, Let It Go ?

  Jenny
You Know, The Guy In Hudson.

  Dan
You Told Her ?

  Allison
No, Of Course I Didn't Tell Her. Rufus.

  Rufus
I Would Never.

  Jenny
I Overheard Dan And Dad Talking.

  Rufus
He Heard Us Arguing On The Phone.

  Dan
Yeah, If You Want To Keep Secrets, Maybe We Should All Abandon The Loft And Move To A Place With More Walls.
...

  Rufus
It's Always good To Give Him A While.

  Allison
Yeah, No, I Knew-I Knew That.

[IN BLAIR'S ROOM]

  Blair
I Can't Believe He Told Her You Guys Were Gonna Do It.

  Serena
Well, I Told You.

  Blair
That's Different. I'm A Girl.

  Serena
Yeah, Well, So Is She.

  Blair
Exactly My Point. But Even If She Wasn't, When You Get A Boyfriend, You Become The Best Friend, And The Best Friend Becomes The Second Best Friend. That's Just How It Has To Be If It's Ever Gonna Work.

  Serena
Hey, You Still Haven't Told Me How Nate's Doing. It's All Over The News.

  Blair
Uh, When I Talked To Him This Morning, I- I Told Him To Focus On His Family Today.

  Serena
But He's Still Coming To Your Party, Right ? Here.

  Blair
Uh, I Told Him Not To Worry About It. I Mean, Only If He's Up To It.

  Serena
You're Such A Good Girlfriend, B., Really. Hey, Um, I'll Just Pick You Up, And We Can Go Together, But I Really Hope Nate Can Make It.

[NATE's HOME]

  Anne
Nate, Here You Are. I've Been Looking Everywhere For You. I Was Up In Your Room. I Was Calling Your Name For 20 Minutes. Hey, Take Your Earphones Out. Take Your Earphones Out. Nathaniel, I've Been Calling You For 20 Minutes.

  Nate
I'm Sorry. What Is It ?

  Anne
Blair's Birthday Party Is Tonight, Isn't It ?

  Nate
Yeah.

  Anne
I Was Thinking Maybe You Should Give Her Something Special.

  Nate
I'm Sure She's Already Picked Out Something At The Jewelry Store And Put It On Hold.

  Anne
Something More Special Than That.

  Nate
Mom, That's A Family Heirloom. I'm Not Giving It To Blair. It's An Engagement Ring.

  Anne
I'm Not Asking You To Propose, But It's Important That Blair Knows How Much You Value Her Loyalty.

  Nate
Her Loyalty Or Her Mother's ?

  Anne
Eleanor's Lawyers May Have Called. What Difference Does It Make ? One Day We'll All Be Family, And They Won't Have A Choice In These Matters.

  Nate
Blair And I Broke Up Last Night.

  Anne
Well, Then Get Back Together.

  Nate
I Don't Think So.

  Anne
PMay I Remind You It Was Your Own Rash Actions That Got Us Into This Predicament ?

  Nate
We're In This Predicament Because Dad Has A Drug Problem. I Was Trying To Help Him.

  Anne
Then Help Him. Your Father's Acting The Way That He Is Because He's Scared. He Needs You So Much Right Now, More Than He Ever Has. We All Do.

  Gossip Girl
Whoever Thought Monarchy Was Dead Didn't Realize It Just Changed Zip Codes. So What Will It Be, Nate, Blair Waldorf's Hand Or Your Father's Head ?

[BLAIR IS IN HER ROOM AND NATE IS ON THE STREETS]
Blair (On the Phone) : Hi. Are You Okay ? Uh, I've Been Texting You All Day.
Nate (On the Phone) : Yeah, I'm-I'm Fine. Thanks. I, Um, Just Been A Little Busy.

  Blair
I Just Wanted To Check On You, See If You Need Anything.

  Nate
Yeah, I Kinda Do.

  Blair
Oh ?

  Nate
Um... Blair, Do You Think We've Been A Little... A Little Hasty With The Whole Breakup ?

  Blair
I- I Don't Know, Nate. Um, It Was A Pretty Difficult Decision.

  Nate
Yeah, Look, I-I Totally Understand. I'm Sorry. I, Um, I Shouldn't Have Brought It Up.

  Blair
Uh, But We Do Have A Lot Of History Together, And, Uh, It Was In The Heat Of The Moment, But You'd Have To Be Willing To Really Work For It.

  Nate
Yeah, Yeah, Of Course. Listen, We'll Just Take It Slow And See How It Goes. And, Um, I've Got A Birthday Present For You. It's, Uh, Something Special.

  Blair
J'ai trop hate de l'ouvrir  ma fete ! A ce soir alors !
Nate (Line Disconnects, Dial Tone) : I...

  Blair
Hi. This Is Blair Waldorf. I Was Wondering If Any Of The Pieces That I Put On Hold Were Picked Up Today. The Diamond Necklace ? Really ? Okay. (Laughs) Thank You. (Squeals) Thank You, Thank You, Thank You. (Squeals)

[DAN'S ROOM]

  Allison
Hey. Can We Talk ?

  Dan
Well, That Depends. Are You-Are You Back For Good ?

  Allison
I Don't Know. Your Father And I Haven't Really Had A Chance To Talk, So...

  Dan
Well, Do You Want To Come Back, Or Do You Wanna Live In Hudson With, Uh, Neighbor Guy ?

  Allison
Okay, Look, Dan, I Understand That You're Mad, All Right ? And I'm Not Gonna Defend What I Did.

  Dan
No, You-You Don't Get It, Do You ? You Think I'm Only Mad About The Cheating ?

  Allison
Okay. What Else ?

  Dan
(Sighs) Maybe That You Promised You Would Be Home By The End Of Summer, And Then You Weren't. Maybe The Fact That You Left At All.

  Allison
I Asked If You Were Okay With Me Going Away, And I'd Hoped That If There Was A Problem, You Would Say Something.

  Dan
Like What ? "Your Daughter's A Freshman At A School "Populated By Mean Girls And Date Rapists ? I Think She Needs Her Mom." Or Maybe "My Father Is Madly In Love With You And Will Probably Never Get Over This" ? Why Should I Have To Tell You This ?

  Rufus
Where Are You Going ?

  Dan
Out. I'll Call Later.
...

  Allison
Well, That Went Well.

  Jenny
You Know, I Was Thinking Of Going Out Also. There's Something I Kinda Need To Do.

  Rufus
Oh, Yeah. You Need Some Help ?

  Allison
Can I Help You ?

  Jenny
No, I'm Good. Thanks.

[CHUCK'S HOME]

  Nate
Come On, Man. I Can Hear You Breathing On The Other Side Of The Door. Is She
Anybody You Can Get Rid Of ? I Just Really Need To Talk To You, Man. Please.

  Chuck
Nathaniel.

  Nate
Where's The Girl ?

  Chuck
In My Dreams. I Was Trying To Get Some Shut-Eye. What's On Your Mind ?

  Nate
It's My Mom.

  Chuck
Sounds Freudian.

  Nate
(Sighs) She Wants Me To Give Blair Her Ring.

  Chuck
What ? You Guys Broke Up.

  Nate
(Scoffs) Yeah, I Know. I Mean, Uh, Wait. How Do You Know ?

  Chuck
Predictably, Your Ex Ran The Old, Uh, Grill-The-Best-Friend Play. Tried To Find Out Where Your Head Was At. So, Uh, Where, Uh, Where Is Your Head ?

  Nate
Spinning. I Mean, My Mom Wants Me To Get Back With Blair So Eleanor Doesn't Pull out Of Their Business Deal. It's All Because Of My Dad's Whole Trial Thing, You Know ?

  Chuck
Yeah. I'm Sorry About All That, But Look, If You're Done With Blair, Be Done. Don't Cave To Your Parents' Wishes If They're Not Your Desires.

  Nate
Excuse Me ? Where's My Boy ? "Seal The Deal. Tap That Ass. Money Marries Bigger Money" ?

  Chuck
Look, I Care About Three Things, Nathaniel. Money, The Pleasures Money Brings Me And You. I'm Just Trying To Have Your Back Here. Your Parents Have Been
Controlling You Your Whole Life. If It Doesn't End Now, When Will It Ever ?

[BLAIR'S BIRTHDAY PARTY AT THE KATI'S BROTHER PLACE]

  Serena
Oh, My God. Hey, Guys !

  Katie and Isa
Hey, Serena ! Blair ! Happy Birthday ! Happy Birthday !

  Blair
Oh, My God, Kati. Your Brother's Place Looks Fabulous.

  Kati
Yeah, I Know, Right ? I Know.

  Serena
It's Incredible.

  Kati
Come On, Guys. Let's Check It Out.
...

  Serena
Hey. So Where's Nate ?

  Blair
Um, I'm Sure He'll Be Here Soon. What About Dan ?

  Serena
Oh, Uh, He Said He's Coming, But I Haven't Talked To Him Since This Morning.

  Blair
Well, You Better Check In On Him. Make Sure The Best Friend Hasn't Whisked
Him Away To Do Some Friendly Activity.

  Serena
Oh, Shut Up. Oh, There's Chuck. I Bet He Knows Where Nate Is.

  Blair
I Think Nate Probably Just Snuck In While We Were Dancing.

  Serena
Chuck.

[ON THE STREETS]

  Dan
Well, Thanks For Listening To Me Complain About My Family All Afternoon.

  Vanessa
Oh, Look, I Know It's Hard Right Now... (Cell Phone Ringing) But Your Family's One Of The Good Ones, And Your Parents Really Love Each Other. They'll Figure It Out, And In The Meantime, You've Got Me.

  Dan
Um, Actually, I Was Gonna Go Meet Up With Serena.

  Vanessa
Oh, Sure. Have Fun.

  Dan
I Will. What Are We Doing ?

  Vanessa
I Thought You Said We Weren't Doing Anything.

  Dan
I Like Serena, And I Like You, And She Likes Me, And You Like Me, So How-How Can You Not Like Each Other ? It's Mathematically Impossible.

  Vanessa
Who Said I Didn't Like Her ? I Just Don't Know Her.

  Dan
Yeah, And You're Making A Real Effort To Change That. I Mean, Why Spend Five Minutes Trying To Be Nice To Serena, When I Can Spend Day After Day Forced To Choose Between The Two Of You ?

  Vanessa
Okay, Fine. You Want To See Me Get My Nice On ? Let's Do It Tonight. Just You, Me And Serena. Um...

  Dan
Tonight-Tonight Is Blair Waldorf's Birthday Party. Uh, I Think We Might Want
To Start By Dipping A Toe Rather Than Diving Off Of A Cliff, Headfirst, Into The Rocks With The Sharks.

  Vanessa
Why ? We All Know How To Swim. Come On. You Want To Do This, Let's Do It.

[IN THE KATI'S BROTHER PLACE]

  Chuck
Are You Ready For Your Present ? (Blair takes him by the hair) Ow ! If You Wanted To Play Rough, All You Had To Do Was Ask.

  Woman
Hi. Hi.

  Blair
Hello There. Happy Birthday To Me. (Sighs) You Nauseate Me.

  Chuck
All This Talk About How You Have To Be With Nate Or The World Will End. Face It. It's Over.

  Blair
You Sound Like A Jealous Boyfriend.

  Chuck
(Scoffs) Yeah, Right. You Wish.

  Blair
No. You Wish.

  Chuck
Please. You Forget Who You're Talking To.

  Blair
So Do You. Do You... Like Me ?

  Chuck
Define "Like".

  Blair
Oh. Uh, You Have Got To Be. I Do Not Believe This.

  Chuck
How Do You Think I Feel ? I Haven't Slept. I Feel Sick, Like There's Something In My Stomach, Fluttering.

  Blair
Butterflies ? No, No, No, No, No, No, No. This Is Not-Not Happening.

  Chuck
Believe Me, No One Is More Surprised Or Ashamed Than I Am.

  Blair
Chuck, You Know That I Adore All Of God's Creatures And The Metaphors That They Inspire, But... Those Butterflies Have Got To Be Murdered.

  Chuck
Fine. It Wasn't That Great Anyway.

  Blair
Thanks.

[ON THE STREETS]

  Nate
Jenny

  Jenny
Oh. Hi, Nate.

  Nate
Hey.

  Jenny
I Told Blair, And I Shouldn't Have. I'm Sorry.

  Nate
Oh, About What Happened At The Ball ? It's, Uh, It's Not Your Fault.

  Jenny
So... How Have Things Been Between You Guys ?

  Nate
Uh, Strange, But Again, Not Your Fault... So You Gonna Go Inside ?

  Jenny
I Was Planning On It, But Now That I'm Here, I'm Not So Sure.

  Nate
Yeah. Me Neither.

  Jenny
Blair Invited Me Before Our Fight, And I Was Gonna Run In And Give Her This Card, Which Says "I'm Sorry" like 30 Times. (Chuckles) Maybe You Could Just Deliver It For Me, Though ?

  Nate
Uh, Do You Wanna Go Take A Walk Or Something ?

  Jenny
With You ? Um, What Would Blair Think ?

  Nate
Well, Blair's Up There. Unless, Of Course, You Wanna Go. It's Up To You.

  Jenny
A Walk Sounds Good.

[IN THE KATI'S BROTHER PLACE]

  Blair
Thank You. (Elevator Bell Dings)

  Serena
Dan, You're Here ! And, Um, And You Brought Vanessa. Hey. Good To See You. Um, Kati And Is, You-You Know Dan. Uh, Blair, This Is, Um, Dan's Friend Vanessa.

  Vanessa (to Dan)
Wow. You Didn't Mention They Were So Nice. Now I Get It.

  Blair (To Serena)
Oh, Sweetie, You Did Not Tell Me She Looked Like That. This Is Such A Problem.

[IN THE LIVING ROOM OF THE HUMPHREY]

  Allison
Rufus, I'm Sorry. I Know That You're Upset.

  Rufus
You're Getting That, Huh ?

  Allison
Can You Please Talk To Me ? Please ?

  Rufus
I Only Have One Question, And I'm Pretty Sure I Don't Want To Hear The Answer.

  Allison
It Happened One Time, And I Wish It Hadn't, And It's Over.

  Rufus
Then Why Did Our Daughter Have To Go To Hudson And Drag You Back Here ?

  Allison
Because When We Spoke On The Phone, I Didn't Really Get The Impression That You Wanted To See Me. I Thought I Should Give You Some Space.

  Rufus
This Family Has Had Way Too Much Space. You Never Should Have Left.

  Allison
Can We Not Go Through This Whole Thing Again ? Please. You Know That I Wasn't Happy.

  Rufus
Yeah. You Happy Now ?

  Allison
In Some Ways, I Am. I Know You Don't Want To Hear That.

  Rufus
Look, Please Don't Act Like You Care What I Want.

  Allison
(Gasps) Rufus. I Was There For You When You Were All About Your Music, When You Were On The Road For Months At A Time And Everything That Went With It. My Whole Adult Life Has Been About You. And Now I'm The One That's Screwed Up. I Guess I Was A Late I Just Need You To Care Enough About Me To Try.

  Rufus
Alison... I Care. I Care.

[IN THE KATI'S BROTHER PLACE]

  Blair
Stalk Me Much ?

  Chuck
What Are You Still Doing Up Here All Alone ?

  Blair
I Don't Know Where Nate Is, And He Always Calls Me At Midnight, When It Turns Into My Birthday.

  Chuck
Well, I Wouldn't Count On It Tonight. Doesn't It Strike You As, Uh, Just A Little Bit Of Coincidence, The Timing Of Everything ?

  Blair
What Do You Mean ?

  Chuck
Well, Nate Suddenly Decides He Wants To Get Back Together Just Moments After Your Mother Puts The Brakes On Her Deal With The Captain ?

  Blair
So You're Saying That Nate Is Only Pretending To Like Me, And That He's Actually Using Me To Get To My Mother ? He Wouldn't Do That.

  Chuck
Yes, He Would. If It Was To Help His Family, You Know He Would.

  Blair
Nate Loves Me. Whatever He's Doing, Wherever He Is, He Will Call At Midnight. You'll See.

  Chuck
Care To Make A Wager ? If He Calls, I'll Leave You Alone Forever. If He Doesn't, You Spend The Night With Me.

  Blair
I Will Not.

  Chuck
I Thought You Were Sure.

  Blair
You're Gonna Lose. He's Never Missed My Birthday.

  Gossip Girl
Careful, B. There's No Safe Wager When You Bet On A Bass. You Just Might Lose Your Shirt And Your Pants.

[IN THE KATI'S BROTHER PLACE]

  Serena
So You Brought Vanessa As Your Date To Blair's Party ?

  Dan
No, No, You're My Date. I Just Thought It Might Be A Good Opportunity For All Three Of Us To Hang Out.

  Serena
Oh, Yeah, 'Cause It Was So Fun And Not Remotely Awkward At Breakfast This Morning.

  Dan
Fine. You're... You're Right. I Actually Thought This Would Be A Very Bad opportunity For Us To Hang Out, But I Kind Of Suggested To Vanessa That She Wasn't Making An Effort To Get To Know You, So, Uh, She Decided To Start Tonight, But If It's Weird, I Can Go Talk To Her.

  Serena
No. No, No, No, Don't Do That. Look, Tell Me Something Vanessa Likes Besides You, And I Will Make An Effort To Bond. I Promise.

  Dan
Oh, Thank You.

  Vanessa
So What Now ?

  Serena
Ever Play "Guitar Hero" ?
...
(Cheers And Applause) Yeah !

  Vanessa
Thank You. Thank You.

  Katie
Oh, She Owned You, Serena.

  Isabelle
Yeah, You Went Down Almost As Hard As Britney At The V.M.A.S.

  Serena
Okay, You Know, You're Good, Vanessa. I'll Admit It, But I Have Been Holding Back Until Now. There's A Little Birdie That's About To Be Free.

[Serena play Guitar Hero]

  Dan
That's My Girl! That's It. Right There.

  Serena
Thank You. Thank You. Who Got On Now ?

  Vanessa
Not Bad, But Skynyrd Is Meat And Potatoes, And I'm Bringing Dessert, So What Do You Say To A Slice Of "Cherry Pie" ?

[Gags]

  Dan
No Pie. I Say No, I Beg You.

  Vanessa
Come On. There's Nothing Like A Little '80s Hair Metal To Put A Smile On Your Face. After The Day You've Had ?

  Serena
The...The Day You've Had ? What... What Kind Of Day Have You Had ?

  Vanessa
You Didn't Tell Her ?

  Dan
Uh, No. No, Not Yet. Not Yet. Um, It Was Kind Of An Odd Day At The Humphrey Loft. Uh, Actually, Jenny Brought My Mom Home.

  Serena
Your Mom's Back ?

  Dan
Yeah.

  Serena
Excuse Me.
...

  Serena
I Can't Believe You Didn't Tell Me Your Mom Came Home.

  Dan
I'm Sorry, Really. Uh...

  Serena
What ? You Didn't Think It Was Important ?

  Dan
No, No, Of Course It Is.

  Serena
Why Bother ? You Already Told Vanessa.

  Dan
I Tell Vanessa Everything, All Right ? I Have Since I Was 6.

  Serena
Well, You're Not 6 Anymore, Dan. I Just-I Was Just Hoping That I Would Be The PersonThat You Would Wanna Tell These Things To Now.

  Dan
I Want You To Be That Person, Too. Really, I Do. This Whole Girlfriend Thing Is Very New To Me, You Know ? I- I Just... I Don't Know All The Rules Yet.

  Serena
Well, Blair Says In A Relationship, The Best Friend Is...

  Dan
Serena, You're Really Taking Relationship Advice From Blair ?

  Serena
(Sighs) Good Point. Look, I Just Don't Want To Have To Compete With Vanessa. You Know, With "Guitar Hero, " Okay. I'm Way More Awesome, If You Didn't Happen To Notice. But, Um, Not With You.

  Dan
That's Fair. All Right, So Tomorrow, You And I Will Go Somewhere Together, Just The Two Of Us, And We Will Talk About My Family In Excruciating Detail Until You Are- You're Just So Bored, You're Begging For Vanessa To Take Over, All Right ? How's That Sound ?

  Serena
Perfect. (Chuckles) All Right. Come On. It's Almost Midnight.

  Dan
What Happens At Midnight ?

[ON THE STREETS]

  Jenny
I Heard About Your Dad. I'm Sorry.

  Nate
Well, If It Makes You Feel Any Better, My Family's Not Doing That Great Right Now Either.

  Jenny
You Know, I Actually Didn't Want To Come To Blair's Party As Much As I Just Wanted To Get Out Of My House.

  Nate
Yeah, I Know The Feeling. Blair's Birthday Present.

  Jenny
Your Mother's Ring. Blair Told Me About It. Wow. It's Beautiful.

  Nate
I'm, Uh, Supposed To Give It To Blair Tonight.

  Jenny
I'm Guessing That Wasn't Your Idea.

  Nate
Blair And I Broke Up, And I Know It Was The Right Thing To Do. I Mean, We Just Shouldn't Be Together Right Now, You Know ?

  Jenny
Sounds Like You're Pretty Sure Of That.

  Nate
I Am, And As Much As I Wanna Do The Right Thing And Help Out My Parents, It's Just-It's Not Fair. I Mean, To Me Or To Blair. I Just Think That If I Do This Now, When Does It Ever Stop ?

  Jenny
It'll Only Stop When You Stop It.

[IN THE KATI'S BROTHER PLACE]

  Chuck
12:01. I'm Sorry.

  Blair
No, You're Smarmy. There's A Difference. If You're Coming To Collect, You Can Forget It.

  Chuck
Turn Around.

  Blair
You Get Grosser By The Second.

  Chuck
(Sighs) You Get Older. Look.

  Serena
Happy Birthday ! (Laughs)

  Isa
Blair, Blow Out Your Candles.

  Kati
I Know.

  Katie et Isa
Make A Wish, Blair.

  Blair
It Already Didn't Come True.

  Gossip Girl
Happy Birthday To Who ? Forget Cake And Ice Cream. I'm Saving Room For Just Desserts. Looks Like Chuck's Wish Might Come True.

[ON THE STREETS]

  Nate
Hey... So I Don't Know How It Was Possible Given How The Day Started, But, Um, I Actually Had Kind Of A Good Night. (Giggles) Your Parents Won't Be Mad You're Coming Home So Late, Right ?

  Jenny
Oh, No, They Think I'm With A Friend.

  Nate
Huh. Well, They Think Right.

  Jenny
I Had Fun. (Giggles)

  Nate
Me, Too. You Have A Good Night.

  Gossip Girl
Spotted : Nate Archibald Depositing A Mystery Girl In A Taxi After Midnight. All We Know About Her For Sure ? She's Not Blair Waldorf.

[IN THE KATI'S BROTHER PLACE]

  Katie et Isa
Oh my God

  Serena
Did You Guys See This ? I Can't Believe Gossip Girl Would Do This To Her On Her Birthday.

  Serena
You Know What ? Maybe She's Wrong. It Wouldn't Be The First Time.

  Katie
I Can't Believe Gossip Girl.

  Serena
Blair, Hey, I'm So Sorry. I Never Would've Thought That This Would Happen.

  Isabel
I Hope The Slut Gave Him Herpes.

  Katie
Cheater Totally Deserves Herpes.

  Blair
He Isn't Cheating. We Broke Up, Okay ? He Was Gonna Get Back Together With Me, But Only So My Mom Would Help His Dad. (To Chuck) You Satisfied ?

  Serena
Blair... Blair, Stop, Okay ? Talk To Me.

  Blair
(Voice Breaks) We Ended It. I Wanted To Tell You, But-But Part Of Me Thought That If I Didn't Say It Out Loud, Then It Wouldn't Be True.

  Serena
Shh. Shh.

  Blair
It Was My Birthday Wish For Us To Get Back Together. Now I Think It's Really Over.

  Serena
Oh, Blair, Shh.

  Blair
Is It Okay If I Just Wanna Be Alone For A Second ?

[NATE'S HOME]

  Howard
Nate, Hey. What Are You Doing Home So Early ?

  Nate
It's After Midnight.

  Howard
We Just Thought You'd Be With Blair.

  Anne
How Did She Like Her Gift ?

  Nate
I Didn't Make It To The Party Tonight.

  Anne
You Can Call Her In The Morning, Maybe Take Her To Lunch.

  Howard
It's A Good Plan. Really More Special This Way.

  Nate
Dad, I Know You Think Blair Will Help Save You, But I'm Not Doing This. It's Over.

  Howard
Nate. There's Nothing In This World I Wouldn't Do To Protect Our Family, And I'm Sure You Feel The Same. I Need Your Support Here, Son, And Your Trust.

  Nate
(Scoffs) Well, You Better Hope For Your Sake. They Don't Call Your Son To The Stand.

God, I Have Missed Your Smile.

  Allison
Mm. I Have Missed Everything.

  Rufus
Please Tell Me That Is Someone Coming To Rob The House.

Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

  Allison
Hey, Jenny.

  Jenny
As You Were.

[IN THE KATI'S BROTHER PLACE]

  Vanessa
Is Your Friend Gonna Be Okay ?

  Serena
Um, I'm Not Sure. She Just Broke Up With Her Boyfriend, And Then They Got Back Together And Then, Um, I Don't Know What Just Happened.

  Vanessa
Well, She's Lucky To Have You. Being A Good Friend Is...

  Serena
Challenging At Times ?

  Vanessa
Hey, If I've Been Acting However I've Been Acting, It's Just 'Cause I'm Protective Of Dan.

  Serena
And I'm Protective Of Our Relationship. I've Never Actually Had One Before. You Guys Just Have Everything In Common, And, Um, I'm Just Getting To Know Him. So, You Know, It Can Be A Little Intimidating.

  Vanessa
Talk About Intimidating. You Just Admitted That You Find Me Intimidating, So How Cool Does That Make You ?

  Serena
I Think You Forgot To Mention My Superior "Guitar Hero" Skills.

  Vanessa
No, I Didn't Forget That. And At The Next Party, I'm Asking For A Rematch, 'Cause You Were About To Get Smoked.

  Serena
Oh, Really ? Well, I Think The Only Thing Getting Smoked Is Your Pale Imitation Of A Guitar Player.

  Vanessa
Hey, I Am A Golden God.

  Serena
Oh, Really ? Are You Now ?

  Dan
Hey. Am-Am I Interrupting Anything ?

  Serena
Um, Actually, You Are.

  Vanessa
I'll Give You Guys A Moment.

  Dan
Might That Have Been Bonding That I Just Walked In On ?

  Serena
A Little Bit.

  Dan
Yeah ? What Were You Talking About ?

  Serena
Nothing You Need To Know About.

  Dan
Oh, So You Have Secrets Now ? I See. Well, Listen, Um, If You Want To Get Out Of Here, Vanessa Can Only Fit Two On Her Vespa, But I Can Walk.

  Serena
Oh, Well, You Know I Love Me A Vespa, But, Um, I Think I Gotta Stay Here And Be With Blair. You're Not The Only One With A Best Friend.

  Dan
Yeah.

[IN A ROOM AT THE KATI'S BROTHER PLACE]

  Blair
I'm Not In The Mood, Chuck. This Is Pretty Much The Worst Birthday Ever.

  Chuck
Maybe It Can Be Salvaged.

  Blair
Is That Our s*x Tape ?... It's The Erickson Beamon Necklace. No, I Couldn't.

  Chuck
Yes, You Can. Something This Beautiful Deserves To Be Seen On Someone Worthy Of Its Beauty. I Really Am Sorry.
Serena see Blair and Chuck in the room.

She Lost 15 Pounds, Got An Eye Lift.
It'S Been Good For Her.
My Mom Kind Of Left Us A Couple Months Ago.
My Dad And My Sister Don'T Really See That.
I Don'T Know What'S Happened With My Wife Or My Marriage, And You Showing Up Here Randomly Doesn'T Make Figuring That Out Any Easier.
Am I The Only One Who Thinks This Is Extremely Weird? Forget About It.
If Dad Can Let It Go, So Can You.
I Can'T Believe You Didn'T Tell Me Your Mom Came Home.
Your Wife Despises Me.
I Wouldn'T Say That.
Well, She Did.
You Should Deal With Your Father.
He Needs You.
I Don'T.
We Broke Up, Okay? He Was Gonna Get Back Together With Me, But Only So My Mom Would Help His Dad.

Season 01 Episode 09 As Per Gossip Girl'S Thanksgiving Tradition, I'M Trading My Laptop For Stove Top, And For The Next 16 Hours, The Only Thing I'M Dishing Is Seconds.
When The Cat'S Away, The Mice Will Play.
Have Fun, Little Rodents.
I Mean, Who Gets Wasted On Thanksgiving? The Holidays Are Lonely For People.
I Wanted To Keep 'Em Company.
Whoo! Thanksgiving.
Last Year.
Your Mom Is Freaking Out, So My Mom Is Freaking Out.
What, Which Means You Freak Out? Blair, Just Cut The Cord.
Go Nuts.
Come On.
Let'S Do Shots.
Come On! I Told Lily That You Were Buying A Pie.
Oh, Pie.
Where Is Your Purse? - Uh, My Purse - Oh, Great.
All Right.
You Stay Here, Okay? I'M Gonna Go Look.
Don'T Drink Or Hit On Anything.
Pie'S Been Secured.
Thanksgiving No Longer Needs To Be Canceled, All Right? Um Hey, Mom, You Know, I Need To Go.
I'M Sorry.
Bye.
Oh, Man.
Hey! What Are You Doing? Hey, Right Of Way, Pal.
Screw You, Buddy! Hey, Uh, Excu-Excuse Me.
D- Do You Need, Like, A Crossing Guard Or A Cab Maybe? Oh, Pie.
It'S More Like Roadkill Now, But, Uh, Better It Than You, Right? Um I'M-I'M Dan Humphrey.
Hi.
Hi.
Uh, I Don'T Know.
We Met Last Year.
You M- You Might Not Remember.
Yeah, I-You Probably Don'T, But Look, You Should Be More Careful.
You Need To Keep Your Hands Off Of Her.
Blair! Trying To Take Advantage Of Her On The Holidays.
Come On.
Let'S Go, Serena.
Bye, Dave.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye, Serena.
Hey.
And Hello To You.
Big National Holiday.
You Excited? Kind Of Am.
Might Be The First Thanksgiving In A While That I Actually Remember.
Yeah, I Bet.
Huh? Nothing.
Uh, You- Uh, You At Blair'S? - Almost.
Her Dad'S Gonna Be Home For The First Time Since He Left, So She'S Really Excited.
Oh, Well, Family Reunions Are All Around Then.
Uh, We, Too, Have A Full Humphrey Household.
Hopefully, It'Ll Stick.
Well, It Seems Like Your Mom Is Really Trying.
Better Thanksgiving Than Never.
Call Me Between Every Course? Okay.
Mwah.
Bye.
Mom, Is It Really Okay To Cook With This Much Heavy Cream? Our Arteries Give Us A Free Pass On Turkey Day.
It'S A Shame Our Family Doesn' Have A Few Hundred More Members.
Do You Think I Bought Too Much? Only By Several Tons.
But It'S Our First Holiday Back.
I Wanted To Make Sure It Was Special.
I Think They Call That Guilt.
Yeah, I Guess They Do.
But If It Means More Midnight Turkey Sandwiches For All Of Us, Then So Be It.
Yeah, See, Dan? Uh, We On This Side Of The Kitchen Choose To Be Positive.
Yeah, Dan.
What'S It Gonna Be? You With Us Or Against Us? Uh Fine.
But Only If I Can Take The Cranberry Sauce Out Of The Can.
That Is My Specialty.
I Have To Find This Recipe Before My Dad Gets Here.
Harold Waldorf'S Famous Pumpkin Pie.
Well, It May Have Been Bobby Flay'S, But It Didn'T Stop My Dad From Taking Credit For It.
It'S Gonna Be Perfect! Look At You.
Quite The Chipper Sous-Chef.
Well, I'M In A Good Mood.
It Happens.
Sometimes 'Cause I Increase My Lexapro, Sometimes Because My Dad'S In Town.
And Sometimes, Mostly Because Things Are Good With A Boy.
You And Nate Get Back Together? You Mean Since Gossip Girl Published Pictures Of Him And Some Skank? So That'S A No.
What'S Chuck Doing Today? Why Are You Asking Me? Well, You Guys Are Friends.
And, Blair, Look, You Know You Can Tell Me Anything.
I'D Be The Last Person To Judge Anyone.
With Good Reason.
Blair, I Saw You With Chuck.
I Don'T Know What I Was Thinking.
I Mean, Sleeping With Him Once, Maybe You Could Understand, But Twice? Wait.
You Slept With Him? - Shh! - Ugh.
Blair! What Happened To No Judging? I'M Not, But I Thought You Wanted To Wait.
I Thought You Wanted To Make Things Special.
Oh, So Nate Gets The Free Pass, And I'M The Slut? Tell Me You Didn' Sleep With Chuck For Revenge.
Well, It Wasn' Because I Like His Natural Musk, And Besides, Nothing Hurts More Than Sleeping With The Best Friend, Right, S.
Way To Prove A Point.
Well, I Learned From The Master.
If You'Re Sleeping With Chuck, I'D Say The Student'S Become The Master.
Are You Jealous You Didn'T Get To Sleep With Him First? There Had To Be Somebody Left On The Upper East Side.
Blair, Darling, Are You Going To Help Me At All? Serena, Do You Know When Your Mother'S Arriving? She'S Not.
We'Re Not Doing Thanksgiving Here Anymore.
Oh.
Why? Because I Uninvited Them.
Happy Holidays, Eleanor.
Mom, I Know It'Sy Fault That We'Re Here, But Let'S Not Get Crazy.
Well, I Don'T Know What You'Re Complaining About.
I'M Just Trying To Provide My Family With A Home-Cooked Meal.
You Don'T Know How To Cook.
Well, Don'T Blame Me.
Talk To Your Sister.
She'S The One That Got Us Exiled From The Waldorfs.
Oh, I'M Sorry.
And Even If You Did Cook, We Don'T Have An Oven.
Preaching To The Converted, Eric.
Look, We'Ll Just Pick Up A Few Things And Try To Make Do.
Like Peking Duck On Thanksgiving.
Not A Bad Idea.
No, Mom.
All The Other Shops Are Closed.
There'S Nothing Wrong With Having Chinese Food On Thanksgiving.
What? Jews Having Been Doing It On Christmas Since Forever.
Look, A Pumpkin.
Isn'T This This Is Festive, Yes? We'Re Gonna Eat A Pumpkin? Mom.
Oh.
So You Couldn' Make It Past The Salad, Huh? I Opened The Cranberries.
My Work Is Done.
How'S Blair'S? Uh, I Wouldn'T Know.
She Gave Me The Boot.
Wh-She Kicked You Out Of Her House? What Happened Now? Uh, Don'T Ask, But The Good News Is, My Mom Is Gonna Slice Us Up A Pumpkin.
Oh, And There'S Duck.
No, No, No.
You Can'T Eat Duck And Raw Pumpkin On Thanksgiving.
Uh, You Know What? I'M The Guardian Of Vanessa'S Sister'S Van For The Weekend, And We Here At The Humphrey Manor Have An Oddly Large Kitchen Table.
What Are You Suggesting? These Smell Great.
Yes, So We Can Starve In A Fragrant Hotel Room.
We'Re Not Starving.
Look, I Got Us Into This Mess, So I'M Gonna Get Us Out Of It.
Elaborate, Serena.
Thanksgiving At The Humphreys.
Dan Invited Me, And Eric'S Friends With His Sister, And His Dad'S Really Cool.
Awesome.
I'M Leaving The Pumpkin.
What Do You Say, Mom? Found It! Sous-Chef, You'Re Needed.
Ready And Awaiting Orders.
I See We Have Extra Help.
Yes, Well, Serena'S Spending Thanksgiving With Us This Year.
Ah, The More The Merrier.
Happy To Have You, My Dear.
Whoo! Yes! The Canaps Were A Huge Success.
I Saved One For You, Blair.
I'M Not Really Hungry.
Well, What Does That Mean, You'Re Not Really Hungry? Well, I Had, Like, 15 Of Them This Morning When Daddy First Made Them.
Serena.
Serena! Do You Think That'S Wise? Darling, She'S Fine.
She Has Been For Two Months.
What Did The Doctor Say? Don'T Drive Us Crazy, Okay? - So, Please.
Ah, Fine.
We Are Going To Need To Set Another Place At The Table.
Laurel Brought One Of The Models I'M Working With.
Do I Know Her? What'S Her Name? His Name Is Roman.
Ah.
Roman.
Not This One, Harold.
We Have To Work Together.
Hey, You! - Happy Thanksgiving.
You, Too.
Good To See You.
Want One? Ah, Sure.
Good Boy.
Nate The Great.
So What'D I Miss? - Mm, Nothing.
You'Re About To Witness The Return Of Sober Serena.
Oh, Nate! - Oh, No.
Or Maybe Not.
Sweetie, Would You Take Her Upstairs? Put Her In The Bath Before Your Mother Gets Wind Of This Whole Situation? What, And Leave You All Alone? Thanksgiving Is Our Thing.
Nate, Will You Please Take Care Of Her? Please? Oh, I Will.
Come On.
Daddy, Can I Help With The Pumpkin Pie? Of Course.
Thank You.
Crush Them.
Thank You Very Much.
Crush Them.
Caterers? What'S Going On Here? Everyone Is Getting Ready For Our Lovely Dinner, And You Should Be, Too.
Everyone Except Daddy.
Where Is He? I Thought You Knew.
Knew What? Your Father Isn'T Coming.
He Didn'T Tell You? He Decided To Stay In Paris.
He'S Got Either Too Much Work, Or Roman Is Too Much Work.
Who Knows? I- I Don'T Understand.
If He Wasn'T Coming, Why Wouldn' He Just Call Me And Tell Me Himself? Darling, You Should Know By Now That Your Father Is Not A Fan Of The Difficult Conversation.
Now Why Don'T You Run Along And Change Into Something A Little More Enchanting? That'S Good.
Are You Sure You Don' Want Us To Stay With You? Yeah, We Don'T Want To Leave You, Mom, If You Don'T Feel Well.
Oh, No.
You Kids Have Fun.
I Don'T Have An Appetite Anyway.
Oh, Hold On A Second.
That Must Be Dan.
Hey! - Room Service.
Oh.
Oh, No, No, No, No, Sir.
You Have The Wrong Room.
Oh, No, You'Re Early.
I Lied.
Mom.
All I Care About Is That You Two Are Together.
I Don'T Want To Be An Imposition.
No.
Man With Van, At Your Service.
Hey.
Hey.
Uh, Bold Choice Of Attire, Mrs.
Van Der Woodsen, Unless It'S What They'Re Wearing On The Runway These Days.
No, My Mom Sicked Out Because She Didn'T Want To Be Imposing.
You Know What? I Am Fine Just Curling Up And Reading A Good Book.
But You'Re Supposed To Be With Your Family On Thanksgiving.
Yeah, And Nicholas Sparks Is Hardly Family.
I'M Not Taking No For An Answer.
In Fact, I'M Not Even Asking.
You Are Coming With Us.
I'M Adult-Napping You.
Fine, Just Stop Talking, And I'Ll Get Ready.
Make It Snappy.
I'M Double-Parked.
Thanks.
Hey, Rufus Humphrey.
Leave A Message, And I'Ll Get Back To You.
Rufus, It'S Lily.
Um, Your Very Persistent Son Insisted That I Join You For Dinner.
I Want To Remind You That My Kids Do Not Know That We Are Friendly, And I Would Like To Keep It That Way.
That Said I Look Forward To Seeing You.
How Could He Just Blow Me Off? Thanksgiving Is Our Ritual You Know He Didn'T Even Call.
How Hard It Is To Pick Up The Phone? Ms Blair, Maybe You Pick Up Phone, Call Your Papa.
Maybe He Tell You The Real Story.
Real Story? With Pearls This Is Good, Mum.
Thank God * Is Still Open.
I Have To Improvise Since We Been Dis-Invited From The Waldorfs At The Last Minute.
Just Like I Was Asked To Step Down From The Committee For The Snowflake Ball, And How I Wasn'T Asked Back To The Lincoln Center Foundation.
I Thought At Least, Your Father'S Lawyer Might Join Us For Dessert.
Mom, Stop.
You Were All For Acting Like Nothing Was Wrong Until It Landed On You.
Nate.
I Forgot To Call The Bail Bondsman.
Maybe He Has Nowhere To Go.
Mom, No One Is More Mad Than I Am, But This Is Not The Right Way.
Nathaniel, I Don'T Need You To Fight This Fight For Me.
Where Do You Think You'Re Going? Anywhere But Here.
Thank You.
What'S Taking Dan And Serena So Long? Hey, We'Re Here.
There You Are.
You'Re Lucky You Made It While The Turkey'S Still Hot.
Mom, This Is Serena, And This Is Her Brother Eric.
It Is So Nice To Meet You Both.
It'S Nice To Meet You, Too.
Nice To Meet You.
Hi.
And This Is Their Mother, Lily.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Just In Time, Thanksgiving.
Last Year.
But I Thought You Were Gonna Bring Pie.
Thanksgiving.
Last Year.
I Did, But It Kinda Got Run Over By A Taxi, Uh, As I Was Trying To Help This Girl Stay Out Of Traffic.
Ah, Well, Who Needs Dessert When We Have A Real-Life Hero In Our Midst? Your Brother Just Saved A Girl.
I Thought You Needed To Be Near A Girl For That To Happen.
Not Just Any Girl.
The Girl.
Oh, The Blonde You Stalk At School? Just The One.
A Thing For Blondes.
You Are Your Father'S Son.
Not Just Any Blonde.
Apparently, I Like The Ones Who Get Drunk On Thanksgiving And Almost Die.
Well, Your Dad Liked 'Em Dangerous And Troubled, Too, So You Were Dangerous? Who Said I Was Talking About Me? Well, I Didn'T Realize There Was Anyone Else.
Well, It Is So Nice To Meet You.
Alison.
Right, It'S Nice To Meet You, Too.
Lily, Was It? - Yes.
Well, I'M Just Gonna Take These Coats And Put Them In, Um, Dan'S Room.
Uh, You Know What? It'S Okay.
I'Ve Got Them.
Oh.
Oh, Thank You.
Okay, Eric And Jenny, Napkin Duty.
Serena And Dan, I Want Every Water Glass Filled, And Every Candle You Can Find Lit.
I Am Sorry.
I Did Not Know That You Were- - Back? Well, I Am.
And Why Would You Know? Well, Dan Never Mentioned It When He Invited Me.
I Called.
I Didn'T Hear The Phone.
You Know What? It'S Fine.
It'S Fine.
Let'S Just Have A Great Time.
This Holiday'S About Sharing.
Right.
And If You Don'T Mind, Um, Could We Not Share Too Much? I Haven'T Exactly Told My Kids About My Past.
Well Our Past.
Hey, Turkey'S Almost Room Temp, Guys.
Come On Down.
You Grab The Mashed.
I Got That.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Blair You Haven'T Touched Your Food.
Come On, Darling.
What Has Gotten Into You? Well, I Was Going To Wait Till After Dinner, But I Guess Now Is As Good A Time As Any.
Did You Call Daddy And Say That I Didn'T Want To See Him This Thanksgiving? Of Course Not.
What A Ridiculous Accusation.
So You Didn'T Tell Him That I Was So Angry At Him For Leaving, That I Didn'T Even Want To Talk To Him Today? You Had No Right To Uninvite Him.
When Are You Gonna Get It Through Your Head? - He Left Us.
He Didn'T Leave Us.
He Left You.
That'S Enough.
That'S Enough.
If You Want To Take This Up With Me, We Can Discuss It Later, After Our Guests Have Left.
Right Now You Either Eat Or You Leave The Table.
I Told You, I'M Not Hungry.
Or Maybe Dessert Will Change Your Mind.
Where Is Daddy'S Pie? I Don'T See His Pumpkin Pie.
Well, There Were So Many Delicious Choices Coming From The Caterer, We Just Sent That One Down To The Doorman.
What Is Thanksgiving After All, Hmm? Now Choose One Of Those Amazing Desserts.
So, Uh, Mrs.
Van Der Woodsen, Um, What Were Thanksgivings Like When You Were Growing Up? Serena Said You Were Raised In California? Oh, I Grew Up On A Little Ranch In Montecito.
I Didn'T Know There Were Little Ranches.
There Aren'T.
I Don'T Mean To Be Rude ,i Think I Should Get This.
Yeah, Sure.
Hey, We'Re Right In The Middle Of Di- Yeah.
O- Of Course.
I'M On My Way.
What'S Up? I'M Sorry, But I Have To Go.
Is Everything All Right? No, But, Um, It Will Be, I Hope.
I'M Sorry.
I Can'T Really Say More, But It'S Nothing About Us.
Okay.
I Was Having A Lot Of Fun, Though.
All Right.
Bye.
I'M Sorry, Mom.
I Have To Go.
Oh, Of Course.
You'Re Such A Good Friend.
Look, Um, I Hope You Don'T Mind, But My Daughter Has To Go.
Do You Need To Go With Her? No, No, No, Mom.
Stay.
Have Fun, Please.
Thanks, Guys.
It Was Nice To Meet You.
Is She Gonna Be Okay? Yeah, Uh, Yeah.
I Don'T Think It Has Anything To Do With Her, But, Um, You Were Talking About Your Ranch.
Did You Have Any Horses? Yes, I Had A Few.
Um, I Had My Own, Rosewood.
My Dad Has A Song Called "Rosewood.
" Oh, But No, Not That Rosewood.
I Completely Forgot About That Song.
Yeah, It'S About My Mom.
You Know, 'Cause She Had This Perfume That She Always Wore.
And It Was Rose And - Sandalwood.
Sandalwood.
It Was Like Her Own Personal Scent.
I'M A Fool.
You'Re Not A Fool.
Um, Raise Your Hand If You'Re Over 30 And Acting Really Weird Right Now.
I'M Sorry, Alison.
I Never Told Rufus About That Horse.
So I'M Sure It'S Just A Coincidence.
Wait A Minute Here.
Why Are You Talking Like You Know Each Other? Do You Two Know Each Other? Uh, We Kinda Did Know Each Other, A Long, Long Time Ago.
What? Know Each Other How? Oh, My God.
This Is Unbelievable.
You Know What? I Need Some Air.
Don'T Follow Me.
You Have A Lot Of Explaining To Do.
Mom, Wait.
May We Please Be Excused? Yeah, Sure.
Watch It.
Come On.
Come On.
Come On.
I Don'T Want A Bath.
Thanksgiving.
Last Year.
Oh, Too Bad.
Thanksgiving.
Last Year.
Blair'S Direct Orders.
Thanksgiving.
Last Year.
Blair'S Not The Boss Of Me.
Sit.
Oh, Are You New Here? 'Cause Blair'S The Boss Of All Of Us.
Oh, Seriously, Serena, You Smell Like The Floor Of A Brewery.
I Do Not.
Yes, You Do.
Oh, My God.
Yes, I Do.
Yeah.
Brewery Floor With A Hint Of Secondhand Smoke? And A Pint Of Old Spice.
Whoa.
I Totally Need A Bath.
Yeah, Deal With It.
Please.
Blair'S A Bossy Genius.
Oh, Yes, She Is.
So What About You? What About Me? I Don'T Smell Like An Ashtray.
But You Look Like An Ass Tray.
Hey, Serena.
Stop, Stop, Stop.
Stop, Serena.
Serena, Stop.
What'S Wrong With You? God.
Oh.
Ow.
God.
Aah!Go Away! Oh, What, What, What, What, What? - You Started It, Dude.
You Started It.
Oh! - What? - Stop It! What Are You Guys Doing? Uh Um Aah! My Hair! I Got You Both! I'M King Of The World.
I'M King Of The World! Hey, It'S Me.
I Didn'T Mean For It To Happen.
I Didn'T See Your Dad Downstairs.
My Mother Just Decides Everything, You Know? Everything In The World Is Just Totally Up To Her.
I Know.
Hey, Why Don'T We Get Out Of Here? I'M Not Going Back To That Party.
No, I Mean, Outta Here, Outta Here.
Out Of This Apartment, To A Place A Little More Sane.
Any Place Would Qualify.
So You Actually Threatened Lily Van Der Woodsen With Physical Violence? Mom, You Are A Badass.
Yeah, Well, What Can I Say? I Was Younger Then And Wearing Steel-Toed Boots.
No, No.
No, We Never Actually Came To Blows.
I Focused On Transforming My Anger Into Art.
I Made Some Collages.
I Wrote A Trilogy Of 1-Act Plays About Her, Named The Character Milly, To Try To Be, You Know, Subtle.
It'S Clever.
So What Was So Bad About Her? And I Mean Aside From The Superior Fluttering Eyelids And Punishing Sarcasm.
Well, Uh, She Was Your Dad'S First Great Love, As She Liked To Remind Me Every Chance She Got.
It'S Kind Of Hard To Compete With That.
You'Ve Uh, Been In Here For A Half-Hour.
Yeah, Well, Not Nearly Enough Time To Fathom How You Allowed Me To Walk Into This Situation.
Allowed You? Th- You Were The Last Person I Expected To Come Through My Front Door Today.
Yeah, Well, At The Very Least, You Knew That Serena Would Come Home And Tell Me All About The Wonderful Thanksgiving She Had With Dan, His Father, Oh, And His Mother.
Is This Really How You Think I Deserve To Find Out? I Don'T Know What I Do Or Do Not Owe You.
I Mean, We Haven'T Actually Defined What We Are To Each Other.
Well, Maybe This Is The Perfect Opportunity To Do It.
But, Lily These Past Few Weeks Have Have Been What? You Can'T Even Say It, Can You? I Can, But I Shouldn'T.
Look, For Better, For Worse, You'Re One Of My Oldest Friends.
Oldest Friends? That'S Certainly Not How It Felt When You Kissed Me At Eleanor'S Party.
What? Alison, Honey Dan, Will You Go And Uh, Check On Jenny And Eric.
Yeah.
Mom, Where'S Dad? How Dare You Do That.
Leave In The Middle Of Thanksgiving Dinner? I Need To Talk To Dad.
Dad? Dad? Oh, My God.
Dad.
Mom, Call 9-1-1.
Hurry! Dad, Please, Wake Up.
Dad! Dorita.
Thanksgiving.
Easy.
Thanksgiving.
Last Year.
Take A Seat, Honey.
Oh, Goodness.
Oh, How Do I Smell Now? Uh, You Smell Fantastic, But You Might Not Wanna Keep Asking People That.
Serena, You Look Wonderful.
That Shirt Was Made For You.
Actually, It Was Made For You.
Well, I Knew There Was A Reason I Liked It.
Yours, Too, I See.
And Mine.
No, No, No, No.
Oh, No, No, No.
Would You Help Me With The Potatoes? Yes.
Don'T Tell Me It'S A Big Deal.
I'M Well Aware Of The Stakes.
Hey.
Who'S Dad Talking To? What Now? The Office.
Something About That Deal With The Dutch Company.
So It Looks Like I'Ll Have To Slip Out For A Few Minutes.
Dad, It'S A Holiday.
Not In Amsterdam.
Well, We Are In America.
Tell Them It Will Wait Till Tomorrow.
Sweetheart, I Don'T Want To Go.
I Have To.
I Brought This Deal In, But If Meltzer Closes It Without Me, I Don'T Get The Commission.
Forget The Commission.
I'Ll Write You A Check Myself.
Sit.
We'Re Just About To Eat.
I Think I Just Lost My Appetite.
Your Father And His Headaches.
Give The Man Some Gravy.
Probably Took The Vicodin And Forgot.
Had Some Whiskey, And The Next Thing You Know- Mom, Seriously, Did You Hear Anything The Doctor Said? With What He Took, He Could Have Cured 30 Headaches.
Mom, He'S Got A Problem, And Ignoring It Almost Killed Him.
Oh, No.
This Is Not My Fault.
I'M Not Blaming Anybody.
You Can Blame Whoever You Want, Just Not Me.
All I'M Guilty Of Is Trying To Make His Life Easier.
Easier? You'Ve Made His Life Impossible.
What Do You Mean? He'S Had Everything He Ever Wanted Just Handed To Him.
My Father Set Him Up With His Own Firm.
He Gave Us The House That We Live In, The Hamptons, The Boat.
He'S Never Had To Earn A Dime, And How Do You Think That'S Working Out For Him, Mom, Huh? Wake Up! All He Had To Do Was Sit Behind A Desk, Put On A Suit And Not Get Arrested, And He Couldn'T Manage To Do That.
You Want Me To Give Him More Responsibility In The Family? Look, I Don'T Know What The Answer Is, But We Can'T Keep Going On Like This, Or Else We'Ll Lose Him.
Excuse Me.
Sorry To Interrupt, But Mr.
Archibald Is Awake.
He Was Asking For You.
Thank You.
You'Re Welcome.
I'Ll Go See How He'S Doing.
No.
I Will.
I'M Not Saying You'Re Overreacting Per Se, Just Having A Reaction That Is Above And Beyond What Is Appropriate.
I Have Been Killing Myself Trying To Make Upfor What Happened In Hudson.
Which Is Not An Overreaction, I Might Add.
And Then I Find Out That The Two Of You Are Making Out At Theme Parties? Oh, It Was Hardly Making Out, And There Is An Explanation.
Hey, Guys.
I'M Back, And I Brought Blair.
Hey.
Wow.
Weird Vibe.
Okay.
Where'S Dan? There'S No Chance We'Re Related, Right? Oh, Look At Eric'S Roots.
What Do You Mean? What'S Wrong With My Roots? They'Re Kind Of Rufus-Like.
Hey.
Serena And Blair.
Blair? Yeah, It'S Me.
Explanation To Follow, But First, What'S Going On With Our Parents? Oh, Uh, Our Dad Dated Your Mom.
Yeah, We'Re Not Related, Though.
What? Ignore My Roots.
Wait.
Wait.
What? You Know What'S Really Weird? There'S A Garage Door In The Middle Of Your Room.
Oh.
Is That Cedric? Wow.
This Day Just Got A Lot Worse.
Hold On.
How Serious Were They-Our Parents? Uh, I Think It'S Safe To Say That They Have Had s*x.
Oh.
No, No, No.
No, I'M Gonna Faint.
To Repeat, We Are Not Related.
She Was A Groupie, And He Was Almost Famous.
Suddenly, My Family Seems So Sane.
This Is Too Much To Handle On An Empty Stomach.
Well, We'Re Not Going Back Out There, So Well, Can We Leave Here Then, Please? Escape.
I Don'T Know.
Maybe Eat? Well, That'S Why They Call It A Fire Escape.
I Think We'Re Splitting Hairs Here, Rufus.
An Emotional Affair Is Just As Bad As A-As A Physical One.
Oh, Please, Nobody'S Buying That.
Emotional Affairs Are Necessary To Keep A Marriage Alive.
And How Many Times Have You Been Divorced? Alison, This Is Not About Lily.
This Is About You And Me.
Exactly, And If We'Re Gonna Have Any Chance, Then She Can'T Be Here.
What, For Thanksgiving? Or Ever? Oh, You Can'T Be Serious.
I Am.
Look, I Have Made Mistakes, And I Know That, But If She'S In Your Life, You'Re Never Gonna Get Over Her.
Alison.
This Is It, Rufus, Okay? If You Wanna Make This Work, Then You Have To Make A Choice.
Mom, Is Such A Hypocrite, And All These Years, She'S Been Riding Me About My Behavior.
And Here She'S Just Mad At You For Being Her.
And All This Time, My Dad Has Been Giving Me This Advice Based On This Girl He Dated.
This Girl-"A Lot Like Serena.
It'S Her Mom.
When You Think About It, It Makes Total Sense That Your Mom Was A Groupie.
I Mean, Only A Woman That Had Completely Satisfied Her Sexual Appetite In Her Youth Would Ever Marry Your Stepdads.
Blair, Can We Not Talk About Mom'S Appetite? - Yeah.
Or Who- Or Who Satisfied It.
It'S Just So Gross.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hey, Mom.
Is Everything Okay? Yeah.
Do You-Do You Wanna Go Home? We Could Call A Car.
Oh, No, Not Yet.
Um, I Need Fries.
Excuse Me.
Could I Get Some French Fries? And Just Keep 'Em Coming.
Sure.
Coming Right Up.
Uh, We Should- Jenny And I Should Probably Head Back To The Loft.
I'M Gonna Go, Too.
Leave You Guys Alone.
S.
Thank You For Today.
The Sandwich Was Delicious.
I'M Calling Dr.
Sherman Tomorrow.
Bye.
Bye.
Is That Really Necessary, Mom? From What I Hear, You Have Been In Places Far Dirtier Than This.
Well Please.
Try Spending Nine Hours With Jane'S Addiction On The Ohio Turnpike.
Then We'Ll Talk About Dirty.
Okay.
See You Later, Waldorf.
So, Uh, So Today Was Not Boring.
No.
I Never Should Have Asked Mom To Come Home, But I Didn'T See This Coming.
Who Could'Ve? Don'T Worry About It.
It'S So Weird To Think That Our Parents Had Lives Before Us, You Know? I Know, Or That They Had Lives Before Each Other, Huh? Lily Seemed Pretty Upset.
I Wonder What Happened While We Were Gone.
Uh, I-I Don'T Know, But It Looks Like We'Re About To Find Out.
Hey! Who'S In The Mood For A Little Humphrey Family Scrimmage? What'Ll It Be? Kids Against The Parents? Boys Against The Girls? Oh, Definitely Girls Against The Boys Because Last Year, I Got Burned By Dan'S Weak Forward Pass.
Hey, Hey, I Was Nursing A Rotator Cuff Injury From Aught-5.
Come On, Mom.
Let'S Go Work Out Our Plays.
Yep.
So, Uh, Dad, Not That I'M- Not That I'M Mad, Exactly, But Not Telling Me About Serena'S Mom Was Extremely Uncool.
I Should'Ve Said Something, I Know.
And I'M Sorry.
Given The Ick Factor Alone, I Would Say That You Set My Progress Back By At Least Several Months.
Oh, Come On.
You'Re A Humphrey Man.
No Daughter Of Lily'S Could Ever Resist.
How'D You Leave It Back There With Her? Well, I Wouldn'T Be Expecting Lil Over For Dinner Anytime Soon.
Your Mom And I Need To Focus On The Future, Not The Past.
That'S A Lot Easier For All Of Us Without Her Around.
Well Well, Let'S Play With The Old Pigskin Then.
Mom.
Here You Are.
And Here You Are.
You Had Me Worried Sick.
Blair, Uh I Know I-I Shouldn'T Have Lied To You About Your Father.
That Never Stopped You Before.
True.
But The Real Truth Divorce Papers From Your Father, And I'M Supposed To Sign Them.
I Haven'T Yet.
Mom He'S Living In Europe With A Man.
You Can'T Be All That Surprised That He Wants A Divorce.
I'M Not, But What I- What I Am Surprised About Is How It Makes Me Feel.
He Was My Husband, After All.
My Harold For Almost 20 Years.
I Couldn'T Face Him During The Holidays.
It Was Always Our Happiest Time.
Why Didn'T You Just Tell Me That? And Let You Choose Between The Two Of Us? I Wonder Who Would'Ve Won That Battle.
Yeah, I Would Have Been Entirely Alone.
Well, Uh, I Was Anyway.
It'S Still Thanksgiving.
Yeah.
What Do You Want To Do? Hey.
Oh, You'Re Still Here.
I Guess I Must Have Fallen Back Asleep.
Yeah, You Were, Uh, You Were Pretty Out Of It When I First Came In.
Where'S Your Mom? She'S Getting Coffee.
How'S Your Mom? She'S Gonna Be All Right.
We All Are.
So Vicodin And Whiskey, Huh? I Guess I Forgot I Took That Medicine When I Took That Drink.
Dad, We'Re Not Doing This Anymore.
Okay? We'Re Just Not.
I Know It Wasn'T An Accident.
Of Course It Was.
And When I Found You, I Thought You Were Dead.
I'M Sorry.
I Just Didn'T I Couldn'T- Yes, You Can.
Dad, You Have To, Please.
I Know It Might Not Always Feel That Way, But We Need You.
Dad, We Need You.
Here You Go, Nate.
Ah, Thank You, Mr.
Waldorf.
My Dad Will Appreciate This.
It'S A Pleasure.
Keep Out The Gravy.
He'S Got High Cholesterol.
Anne, It'S Thanksgiving.
Mom, Seriously.
Give The Man Some Gravy.
It'S Okay.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Yeah, You, Too, Man.
All Right.
See You Soon.
Good Night, Sweetheart.
Good Night.
Hello.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Hey.
Hi.
Happy Thanksgiving, Blair.
Hi.
I Am Looking For My Daughter.
Where Is My Little Girl? Hi.
Too Much Turkey? Bye, Blair.
Happy Thanksgiving.
This Time, I Went For The Ginger Tea.
Good.
Hello.
Where Were You? Exquisite.
Just Say It.
Give Me My Shoe.
Hey, Dan, Will You Pass The Mashed? It'S Over What? Oh, Yeah, Here.
I'M Sorry.
Come On, Son.
You'Re Asleep At The Wheel.
The Humphrey Family Thanksgiving Dinner'S A Well-Oiled Machine.
Were You Still Thinking About Your Dream Girl? What? No.
No, No.
I'M Thinking About, Um, Your Stuffing, Mom, - Which Looks Delicious.
Yeah.
Your Stuffing.
Uh-Huh.
Yeah.
Well, Keep Dreaming.
You Know, Maybe One Day She'Ll Actually Know Your Name.
Yeah, Maybe, And Then I'Ll Have Something To Be Thankful For.
Oh, Shut Up.
Really.
What'S That All About?
(Gossip Girl) Gossip Girl Here-Your One And Only Source Into The Scandalous Lives Of Manhattan's Elite.
You're The Guy Who Gave Us Our First Joint, Snuck Us Into Our First Club.
I'm In This Weekly Game- High Stakes, Big Mey.
.
You Set Me Up.
No One Forced His Hand.
Your Boy Lost Fair And Square.
I Know Who Blair And Those Girls Are, But I Know Who I Am, And I'm Not Gonna Forget That Just 'Cause I Hang Out With Them.
You're Dismissed, Jenny,be good.
(Rufus) I'm Sorry I Kissed You.
Your Mother Must Have Been? Yeah, She Was.
Hi, Rufus.
If She's In Your Life, You're Never Gonna Get Over Her.
You Should Deal With Your Father.
He Needs You.
I Don't.
We Broke Up, Okay? I Like You-Only You.
That's Good, Because I Feel The Same About You.
-Do You Like Me? -(Chuck) Define "Like.
" Tell Me You Didn Sleep With Chuck For Revenge.
Well, It Wasn't because i like his natural musk.
And Who Am I? That's A Secret I'll Never Tell.
You Know You Love Me.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Hey, Upper East Siders, It's That Time Of Year Again, When The Mere Act Of Descending A Staircase Means You're A Woman.
That's Right-Debutante Season.
I'm Actually Glad I'm Going With Prince Theodore Instead Of Nate.
The Further We Get From The Breakup, The More Self-Involved I See He Was.
Always So Brooding, So Tortured.
Ugh.
A Girl Wants Romeo, Not Hamlet.
Romeo Died.
Yeah, But He Died For Something Exciting, And I Want My Debutante Ball To Be Something To Die For.
Hey, So, Uh, Has Blair Mentioned Who's Escorting Her? Why? Are You Having Remorse s*x Fantasies About Your Ex? What? No.
Don't Eff With An Effer.
I Know That Look.
No, Man, It's Just Every Time I See Her Lately, Something's Different.
You Know, She's Lighter.
She's Happier.
(Sighs) She's Just- Less-Less Blair.
She Does Have A Certain Glow About Her, Doesn't She? I Don't Understand Why You Don't Get This, Okay? A Debutante Ball Is All A Girl Could Ask For.
It's Gorgeous And Formal And Totally Legendary.
Don't Forget Out Of Touch And Totally Classist.
And If That's How You Feel, Then Why Are You Even Going? I'm Not Going And Neither Is Serena, Actually.
I'm Just Going To Meet Her Grandmother To Make A Good Impression, And, Uh, Take Off Before I Put My Foot In My Mouth, Like I Usually Do.
All I Get With Nate Is Some Ros? In The Back Of A Town Car, But With The Prince, I Get A Security Detail And A High-Speed Chase To The Pierre After It's Over.
Ooh! I Can See You On The Cover Of "Hello!" Already.
Yeah, Well,? They've Chosen Me For "A Night Out With," And I'm Gonna Give Them The Most Perfect Night Out Of The Year.
With My Dad In Rehab, It's Like The Pressure's Finally Off Me.
You Know, I Can See Blair Clearly, And It's (Sighs) I Don't Know, Man.
I Think I Might Miss Her.
(Scoffs) You Don't Miss Her, Man.
Is Your Mom Mad That You're Not Being Presented? Well, She Doesn't Really? Since I Found Out She Used To Be My Boyfriend's Father's Biggest Fan.
Yeah.
Ew! It Sounds So Gross When You Say It Out Loud.
Silly Me.
Here I Actually Thought You Wanted To Go.
Uh, I'm Here With You,? Yeah, Only 'Cause Your Grandmother's Meeting You Here.
Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah.
Oh! You're Here! I'm So Glad.
Hey! Oh! You're Here! I'm So Glad.
Hey! You're Just Gonna Love Her.
(Dan) I'm Sure I Will.
Well, If You Don't Listen To Me, You're Gonna Hear It From Her, And I Promise, You Don't Want That To Happen.
The Brands I Listed Are The Key To Her Happiness, And That Includes Tanqueray.
Dan, Jenny, It's So Good To See You.
Dan) Hi.
Hi.
Oh, Hey, Jenny, What Are You Even Doing Here? Oh, She Loves These Things, Apparently.
Well, I Wish Serena Did.
It Would Make My Life A Whole Lot Easier.
My Grandma Was The Chairwoman For This Event For 15 Years, And Now The Committee's Asked My Mom To Join.
And My Daughter Could Not Wait To Go For Ten Years, And Then Suddenly, She's Not Even Coming.
Jenny? Jenny? Why Don't You Volunteer? Uh, Well, Blair's Lead Deb, And We're Sort Of On The Outs.
You Know, I'm Sure If She Wanted My Help, She Would've Asked.
Well, I'm Asking.
I Mean, Of Course, We'd Have To Get Your Parents' Permission First, But, Um, We Could Use More Help.
I'm Sure It'll Be Fine.
Um, See You Saturday.
Oh, Actually, It's Sunday.
Uh Can I Call You? Okay.
Ah! There Is My Magnificent Granddaughter.
(Gasps) Grandma.
Oh! (Laughing) Oh, Hello, Mother.
Is There A Bar In This Place? (Gasps) No! I Should've Known I Had To Bring The Party Myself.
So This Must Be Daniel.
Dan, Actually.
Dan Humphrey.
Yeah.
Hi.
My Granddaughter Told Me That You Were Delighted When She Decededuh, Not To Make Her Debut This Weekend? Yeah, Go Ahead.
Tell Her What You Think.
Grandma Loves Honesty.
It's Okay.
Well, Cotillions Just Seem Antiquated To Me.
You Know, Remnant Of A Different Age.
Well, Do Go On.
People Spend All This Money To Have Their Daughters Basically Dance In Front Of Others For Attention.
Uh, When, If You Ask Serena, I Bet She'd Do That For You Right Now, Free Of Charge.
The Cotillion? That Women Should Always Have In Their Arsenal.
I Think Serena's Graces Are Pretty Spectacular As They Are.
Oh, Besides, Grandma, You Haven't Used Your Graces In A While, Rith Oh, You.
(Laughs) Oh, Isn't She Great? She's She's Great.
She's Something.
Dan Humphrey, Was It? Yes, Mother.
You Looked Pretty Hot On Princess Theodore's Arm Today.
Oh, Is That What I Am To You? Just An Accessory? (Chuckles) Next To Him, Yes.
On Me, You'd Be So Much More.
Yes, Well, I Can't Be On You, Remember? Because You Don't Want Nate To Find Out, And I Don't Want Anyone To, But You'd Have To Learn How To Behave Yourself First.
(Dorota) Miss Blair, Mr.
Nate For You.
What Are You Doing Here, Nate? Well, I, Um Look, You Know, After Rehearsal, I Just, Uh, I Couldn't Stop Thinking About You.
I Mean, The Ball's Something We've Talked About Doing Together Since We Were, Like, 10 Years Old, And I've Given You Every Reason To Hate Me.
True.
Keep Going.
And The Prince- He's, Uh, You Know, He's A Great Dancer And All, But Is There Any Chance You'd Go With Me Instead, For Old Times' Sake? Nate, After What You Pulled On My Birthday, The Only Thing We Should Be Doing Together Is Moving On.
Yeah, I Know.
(Chuckles) Look, I Haven't Worn This Sweater In, Like, Forever, And I, Uh, I Just Pulled It Out Today, And I Found This.
It's My Pin.
I Sewed It There So You'd Always Have My Heart On Your Sleeve.
(Chuckles) I Know.
Yeah, I Figured You Might Need It Back Or Something, If No, It Was A Gift.
The Prince Will Understand.
Maybe We Should Go To The Ball Together As Friends.
Absolutely.
But Only As Friends.
Just Friends.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Sweetheart.
I Sense A Favor About To Be Asked.
It's Just Oh.
Well, It Turns Out I Got A Volunteer Position At A Charity.
That's Great.
Mm-Hmm.
When Is It? Sunday Night, And I Know It's Mom's Opening, And I Know It's Really Important, But I Can Do Both.
As A Family, We Support Each Other.
And When One Of Us Has Something Important, We All Show Up For It.
Maybe You Can Volunteer Next Year.
Dad.
Volunteer For What? Nothing, It Doesn't Matter 'Cause Dad Said I Can't Go.
Hey, I, Uh, Went Thrift Store Shopping, And I Found Great Stuff.
I Got You Some Black Vintage Pumps.
They're Gonna Go Perfectly With The Dress You're Gonna Wear For The Opening.
(Scoffs) Mom, The Kids I Go To School With Shop At Saks And Bendel's.
I Can't Be Walking Around In Someone's Old Shoes.
I Know.
It's Gross.
Oh, That Reminds Me.
I Still Haven't Shown You Pictures From My Summer Abroad.
Oh, Yes.
(Squeals) Be Right Back.
(Chuckles) Well, I Know You Must Not Be Happy, Mother.
I Remember How Unhappy You Were When I Didn't Go, And I Imagine You Came All This Way To Change Serena's Mind, But She Is Intractable On This.
That's Not The Reason I Came.
Everything Okay? Lily, My Darling, The, Uh The Doctors Think They Found Something.
Something? What Something? Something In My Lungs.
Oh, No.
Mom.
Well, They're- They're Running Tests, But They Said That, Uh, It Might Not Be Good.
Look, I-I Didn't Want To Worry You.
I- I Don't Want To Be A Burden To You.
I Oh, No, It's No Burden At All.
All I Want To Do Is To See My Granddaughter Make Her Debut The Way I Did, The Way My Mother Did Before Me.
Oh, Mother, Anything For You.
What's Going On? Um, Serena, You're Going To The Debutante Ball.
Serena Van Der Woodsen, Looks Like Your Invitation Just Arrived With Strings Attached.
Come Out, Come Out, Wherever You Are.
Everything All Right, Mr.
Archibald? Oh, Yes, Everything's Fine.
It's Just My My Date- She's Never Late, And, Uh, She Likes To Have Finaapprpral.
Sorry! Sorry, Sorry, Sorry.
My Cappuccino Was Decaf, And I Couldn't Find My Phone.
It Took Forever To Get A Cab.
But You Live Up The Street.
I Wasn't Home.
Well, Everything's Taken Care Of.
I'll Pick You Up At 5:00 In The Car.
I Got That Laurent-Perrier You Like.
(Cell Phone Chirps) I Also Thought We'd Stop By The Modern Afterwards For Dessert, 'Cause That's Your Favorite.
Blair.
Oh, Um, We Don't Have To Go Anywhere Afterwards.
It's Fine.
Sorry.
Who's Texting You So Much? Serena.
Uh, I Gotta Go Back To My House.
My Mom Was Supposed To Throw This For Serena's Grandmother, And She Had To Jet To Paris At The Last Minute, So It's All On Me.
Okay, Hey, Uh, W-I'll Stop By And Help You Out.
It's All Right.
? Who Are You, And What Did You Do With Blair Waldorf? Not Bad, Archibald.
I Almost Forgot How Handsome You Are.
Spotted- Nate Archibald Learning You Don't Know A Good Thing Till It's Gone And Found Someone Else.
So Your Mom Really Didn't Mind Your Coming To, Um, Our Ball With Me? No, Not At All.
(Lily) And Your Father Is Okay With You Volunteering As Well? Um, Excuse Me.
Jenny.
Alison.
Ah.
Didn't Expect To See You Here.
(Chuckles) That's Me, Unexpected.
Um, Mom, Can I Talk To You For A Minute? Uh, No, Sweetie, We'll Have? You Know What? It Is So Nice Of You To Let Jenny Come To Our Little Event.
You Know, Cotillions Really Are Instructive.
They Teach Young Girls Good Social Graces Well, Then I'm Sure She'll Learn A Lot.
I'm Gonna Go.
Um, I'll Come With You.
No Need.
I'll See You Later.
Thank You So Much For Being So Understanding.
Oh, Come On.
I Would Do Anything For An Ill Grandparent, And Besides, My Mom Has Her Art Opening, So We're Both Doing Things For Our Families.
Well, My Thing Isn't Without Conditions, Believe Me.
I Had A Long Talk With My Mom, And I Said If I'm Gonna Do This, Then I'm Gonna Be Myself In Every Possible Way.
Well, Then Can You Promise Me Being Yourself As They Auction You Off, That You Won't Go For Anything Less Than A Million Dollars? Okay.
Did You Get That Out Of Your System? Yeah, I Think I'm Good.
Grandma.
Serena, Darling, This Is Carter Baizen, Your Escort For Tomorrow Night.
Do You Two Already Know Each Other? Actually, We Used? Just A Couple Years Apart.
(Cece) Oh.
Hi.
I'm Carter.
This Is Daniel Humphrey.
Dan, Actually.
Serena's Friend.
(Serena) No, My-My Boyfriend.
Oh, Nice To Meet You, Man.
Nice To Meet You.
I'm Sorry.
You're Not- You're Not Escorting Her Or No, Well, Actually, I'm- Unavailable.
Familial Obligation.
Yeah.
There You Are.
Are You Ready For Tea? I Don't Like My Ice To Get Lonely, Dear.
(Ice Cubes Rattling) (Woman) Of Course, Ma'am.
Carter, It Is Such A Pleasure To Have You Back With Us.
True Gentlemen Are A Rare Breed.
So It Is True That You're Back.
Back? Um, Where-Where Were You? (Kati) Oh, Where Wasn't He? He Disowned His Parents And Took Off Around The World.
Everyone? Gossip Girl Even Had A Dedicated Carter Baizen Map On "Spotted.
" Whoa.
A Map, Huh? In All Honesty, I Did Go A Little Out Of Bounds.
I'm Just Grateful My Parents Are Giving Me A Second Chance.
Carter Saw The Error Of His Wayward Ways, And He Rose Ke A Phoenix From The Ashes, Serena.
Yes, I See That, Grandma.
I Mean, They Weren't All Errors, But Well, Your Mother Did Tell Me That You Got Into A Bit Of A- Ahem-A Scrape In Dubai.
Oh, I Love Dubai.
Did You Stay At The Burj Al Arab? No, I Stayed On Palm Island.
I Think Dubai Is Overrated.
You Know What Isn't, Though? The, Uh, Prince's Crown Bombardier.
And I Also Went Pheasant Hunting With The Sheikh While I Was There.
I Kept The Tags.
I'll Return Everything Tomorrow.
Look I Know That My Coming Back Has Been Rocky But I Can't Keep Being Afraid That If I Act More Like Your Mother And Less Like Your Friend, That I'm Gonna Lose You.
If You Were Still In Hudson, I'd Be Able To Go.
Well, I Am Not There.
I Am Here, And I Don't Really Care If That Makeyou Happy Or Unhappy.
I'm Still Your Mother.
You Can Come To My Show Tomorrow, And Then You Are Grounded For A Week.
What?! Come On, Mom.
That's So Unfair! I Just Don't Get It.
I Organized Everything The Way She Likes It.
I Mean, I Even Made Sure My Bow Tie Matched Her Dress.
Like The Book Says, She Just Not That Into You.
Man, I Have To Find Out?It's Killing Me.
You Guys Are Still Pretty Close, Aren't You? Uh, Yeah.
Could You Find Out Who She's Seeing? Me? Yes.
Come On, Man.
Whbetter? Who Better, Indeed.
Do You Like It Here, Mr.
Humphrey? Well, It's A Little Bit Like A Museum, A Little Cold, Although The Water Pressure Is Unparalleled.
That's Not What I Meant, But Of Course, You Would Make A Joke, That Goes To My Point.
Excuse Me? Did I Miss Something Here? Oh, Yes.
The Way You Feel? It Never Goes Away.
It Just Gets Worse.
I'm Sorry.
I Don't Quite- You'll Always Use Your Dessert Fork For Your EntrE.
You'll Always Feel Underdressed, No Matter What You Wear, And At Dinner Parties, It Will Be As If There's A Language That Sounds Like English, And You Think You Speak It, But They Don't Hear You, And You Don't Understand Them.
As Time Passes, You'll Feel That People Never See You When They Look At You Or Her Charity Case, Until The Day Comes When You Realize That Girls Like Serena Don't End Up With Dan Humphrey.
They End Up With The Carters Of The World, And, Um, People Like You- They Turn Into Cocktail Party Anecdotes Of Their Foolish Youth.
So Why Don't You, Uh, Give It Up And Spare Yourself The Pain, Hmm? I'm Sure Serena Will Understand.
This Just In-We Hear There's A Cold War Brewing Between Lonely Boy And A Certain Blue Blood.
We Never Thought We'd Say This Ourselves There You Are.
What's Going On? I'll Tell You What's Going On.
I Just Became Your Escort To The Ball.
But Our Money's On Brooklyn For The Win.
Thanks So Much For Your Time, Miss Waldorf.
I Guess I'll See You And The Prince Later Tonight.
Uh, Actually, I'm Not Going I'm Going With Nate Archibald.
Ah.
Given Our History, It Was Only Right.
He Is The Perfect Gentleman, The Perfect Date.
Chuck Bass.
Hi.
John Mayberry.
"New York Times.
" I'd Just Like To Say How Proud I Am Of Miss Waldorf And Her Commitment To Mr.
Archibald, Even Though He Ruined Her Thank You.
That Was Great, Right? Take Care.
All Right.
Have A Good One.
What Was That? I Should Ask You The Same Question.
"Perfect Gentleman"? "Perfect Date"? That Broken Record Was A Hit Last Year.
Get With The Times.
He Bores Y.
.
You Almost Made A Fool Of Me In Which Proves My Very Point- You Can't Be Trusted.
Nate Is A Gentleman.
He Would Never Cause A Scene.
Never Get Your Blood Going Either.
Speaking Of Going, That's What You Should Do.
Carter Baizen Is On His Way Here Right Now.
What? What The Hell Are You Doing With Carter Baizen? He Left His Jacket And I'd Rather You Be Gone When He Got Here.
There's Been Enough Scenes For Today.
So I S It's True What They Say About The Apple And The Tree.
Hello, Celia.
I'd Say It's Nice To See You, But I Know How You Hate Dishonesty.
It Appears That Your Son Is Taking My Granddaughter To The Ball Tonight.
He Is? I'd Rather See That Not Happen.
There's No Point In Being Presented If It's Improperly, And Your Daniel Is Not A Proper Companion For A Girl Like Serena.
He's A, Um, Temporary Distraction.
I Need Her To Focus On Heruture.
Hers Or Yours? I Am Willing To Purchase All The Paintings In This Gallery In Exchange For You Convincing Your Son Not To Accompany Serena.
Before You Answer, Remember, A Grown Man With Children Is In A Very Different Position Than A Young Man.
The Money Could Be Useful Now.
Not To Mention, How Much This Sale Would Mean To Your Wife's Career As An Artist.
Your Money Was No Good For Me Then, And It's Still No Good With Me Now.
And You Can Rest Assured That Like Me, My Son Can't Be Bought.
And I Can Assure You, Just Like Her Mother, My Granddaughter Can Be.
What Do You Mean? All Those Years Ago, I Told Lily To Choose Between You And Her Inheritance.
I'd Tell You The End Of That Story, But I Think You Know It By Heart.
You're A Little Overdressed For An Art Show, Don't You Think? Dad, Listen.
Um, I've Been Meaning To Tell You.
I'm Sorry.
Don't Worry About Your Mom.
I'll Take Care Of It.
You Don't Mind? (Sighs) I Thought I'd Be Grounded When You Found Out, Just Like Jenny Was.
I Gotta Admit, It Would Be Worth It.
I Don't Mind At All.
Yeah.
Tux Looks Great.
Shoes Look Great.
You Look So Great.
You're Gonna Make Me Proud.
Show That Celia Rhodes What Us Humphrey Men Are Made Of.
What's Going On Here, Dad? You're-You're Doing That Thing Again Where You're Acting Really Weird For No Reason.
It's Kind Of Freaking Me Out.
Oh, Uh, Serena's Grandmother Just Came To See Me.
Um, We Need To Talk.
Have You Seen Serena's Presentation Statement? Wants To Take A Year Off Of School, Teach English In South Asia? This Simply Won't Suffice.
Well, What Do You Want Me To Do About It? Well, If Serena's Doing This Besides, It Took Me Years To Restore Our Family Name After Your Exploits.
Trust Me, You Don't Want To Do The Same.
Hello? Hey, Volunteer.
Where Are You? You Were Supposed To Be Here A Half An Hour Ago.
Oh, Um, Didn't Your Mom Tell You I'm Not Coming Anymore? What? I Don't Understand.
I Thought That This Was, Like, Your Dream.
Besides, Don't You Want To See Your Brother In A Tux? Wait.
What? You Know, Your Brother Dan- The Guy Who Thinks Dancing Is Making Fists And Pumping 'Em Into The Air? Dan's Going To The Ball? Yeah, It-It Was Just A Last Minute Thing.
I'm Sure He Just Forgot To Tell You.
Um, I'm On My Way.
Hey! W- Wow.
You Look Incredible.
Thank You.
You're Early.
Well, Uh, Yeah, We Need To Talk.
What's Up? Is Your Grandmother Here? Where Is She? Oh, Yeah, She's In The Other Why? I Gotta Be Honest About Something Here.
Um, I Don't Think Your Grandmother Is Who You Think She Is.
What Are You Talking About? I Know She's Got The Whole Free Spirit Act Perfected Act? But I Don't Think She Has Your Best Interests At Heart.
Where Are You Going With This, Dan? She Came By Well, She Probably Just Wanted To See Your Mom's Art.
No, She Was Trying So I Wouldn't Go With You Tonight.
No, She Wouldn't Serena, That's What I'm Trying To Tell You.
That Woman Is The Most Manipulative Person I've Ever Met.
She Makes Your-Your Mother Look Like Gandhi.
That's My Grandmother You're Talking About.
I Love Her.
I Know.
I Know, And I'm So Sorry, But Maybe You Love Her So Much That You Can't See What She's Doing.
(Sighs) I Said It.
There.
Mae We S Suldn't Be Doing This.
Maybe We Shouldn't.
Um I'll Just Talk To You Later.
Let's Get Carter On The Phone.
Yeah.
(Nate) Carter Baizen's Dating Blair? He's Got Everyone Fooled.
Blair Thinks He's Reformed.
He's Obviously Just Toying With Her To Get At You.
Yeah, Well, It's Working.
We Just Need To Wait Until We Can Get Him In A Public Place, Where Everyone Who Thinks He's Changed Can See The Truth, And We Can Get Him Back For Everything He's Done To You And Everything He's Doing To Blair.
Yeah, When's That Gonna Happen, Huh? Sir.
I Have A Feeling It May Be Sooner Than You Think.
And One More, Ladies.
If You Don't Pull It Together, I'm Gonna Go Naomi Campbell On You.
(Sighs) Maybe Jenny Can Help You.
No, I'm Fine.
Thank You.
Serena, Uh, Miss Erlich Needs To Know How To Pronounce That Word In Your Presentation Statement.
I Assume It's A Family Name.
Hey.
Beautiful.
What's Wrong? I Didn't Write This.
My Mother Did.
"Serena Hopes To Continue To Live On The Upper East Side, "Devote Her Life To Volunteering For The Nature Conservancy, And Junior League And Have Two Wonderful Children.
" Let Me See That.
(Blair) Make It Stop.
You Sound Like Me.
Serena, Where'dadan? (Serena) He's Not Coming.
Here You Go.
Thanks.
What Is He Doing Here? (Chuck) Carter's Clever.
He's Using Serena As A Cover.
It's Not The Time Yet.
Nate, Look, I Was Hoping To See You.
I Wanted To Apologize, Put The Past In The Past.
You Don't Get To Say What Goes On Here.
I'm On To You.
What Are You Talking About? Hello And Welcome To The Annual Dispensary Cotillion And Debutante Ball.
Katia Farkas, Daughter Of Jonathan And Rose Farkas, Escorted By Richard North, Hopes To Major In Neuroscience And Will Continue Her Family's Legacy As Supporters Of The New York Public Library And Lincoln Center.
Blair Cornelia Waldorf, Daughter Of Harold And Eleanor Waldorf, Escorted By Nathaniel Archibald, Plans To Be A Member Of Yale's Class Of 2013.
She Will Continue To Summer In Southampton And Volunteer Her Time To Children's Charities.
And Now I'd Like To Present Serena Celia Van Der Woodsen, Daughter Of Committee Member Lilian Van Der Woodsen, Granddaughter Of Chairwoman Emeritus, Celia Catherine Rhodes, Escorted By Carter Baizen.
Miss Van Der Woodsen Hopes To Bed As Many Billionaires As She Can Before Settling Down To (Guests Murmuring) (Woman) Oh, My God.
Sorry.
Miss Isabel Coates, Uh, Presented By Raymond North, Daughter Of Arthur And Iris Coates.
(Woman) Here You Go.
Thanks.
You're Back.
What Happened? Uh, Cece Won.
She Has A Habit Of Doing That, But Maybe It's For The Best.
You're Here With Your Family.
(Man) * You Don't Know What's Right Anymore * Hey.
Where's Jenny? Have You Seen Her? Actually, Uh, No.
She's Probably Still Upset With Me For Grounding Her And Is Trying To Teach Me A Lesson.
I Don't Know.
Maybe Let Her Be Ten Minutes Late Before You Get Mad? Mom, This Looks Great.
All Of This Is Beautiful.
Thank You.
Come On.
Tour.
Okay.
Let's Go.
(The Pierces) * Got A Secret, Can You Keep It? * * Swear This One You'll Save * * Better Lock It In Your Pocket * * Taking This One To The Grave * * If I Show You, Then I Know You Won't Tell * What's Going On? * 'Cause Two Can Keep A Secret * Hmm? Nothing.
* Got A Secret, Can You Keep It? * * Swear This One You'll Save * We're Friends Now, Right? You Can Tell Me.
* Taking This One To The Grave * * If I Show You, Then I Know You Won't Tell What I Said * * 'Cause Two Can Keep A Secret If One Of Them Is Dead * * Got A Secret, Can You Keep It? * * Swear This One You'll Save * And Now For Someone With Only One Left Foot.
* Taking This One To The Grave * He Just Told Her What He's Going To Do To Her Later.
* You Won't Tell What I Said * They Might Not Know Who You Are, But I Sure As Hell Never Forgot.
Nate, What Are You Doing? (Nate) She's My Girlfriend! Oh, My God.
(Carter) Get Off Me! Ugh! They Ripped My Dress.
Take Him Outside.
Let's Get Out Of Here.
Come On.
Come On.
You Don't Understand.
It Was Custom-Made.
Blair, It's Okay.
My Mom Is Gonna Be Angry.
Jenny! Jenny, Hey, Hey, We Need You.
Please? I Have To Go.
I Have My Mom's Thing.
(Blair) Jenny, Fix My Dress, And All Is Forgiven.
Oh, You Make A Fool Of The Presenter, Then You Start A Brawl.
I Mean, What's Next, Serena? "Girls Gone Wild"? Serena Van Der Woodsen Wants To Work For The Junior League And Have Two Children? It's A Society Ball, Serena.
You Have To Represent Yourself Well.
How Is It Representing Myself Well If It's All Lies? What Happened To You Between Our Talk And Now? I Did This Because I Knew How Important It Was For You And Grandma, And You Said That If I Did It, I Could Be Myself.
You Don't Really Want That, Do You? No, It's Not Entirely True.
All You Care About When People Look At Me Is What They Think Of You.
How Am I Supposed To Accept Myself If My Own Mother Doesn't Accept Me? Oh, Honey, No.
No, You Don't, But Let Me Tell You Something.
If I Ever Do Have Those Two Children, I Would Never Do This To Them.
I Would Accept Them For Who They Are, Including Who They Date, No Matter What, And I'd Make Sure They Damn Well Knew It.
Hello? Really? Okay.
Ooh.
I'm So Sorry.
I Know This Is Not What You Signed Up For.
It's Okay.
It Doesn't Hurt Nearly As Bad As Waking Up That Morning In Santorini And Finding You'd Jumped On A Boat.
Yeah, Well, Um, That Night Wasn't Exactly What I Signed Up For Either.
The Whole Thing Caught Me A Bit By Surprise.
No, I, Um, I Get It, Which Is Why I Was Surprised When Your Grandmother Called Me Last Week.
Wait.
Last Week? I Wasn't Even Ing To Cotillion Last Week.
Yeah, But Cece Said She Thought You'd Change Your Mind.
What Are You Doing Here? Shouldn't You Be Anywhere But Here, Yes.
Huh.
So Please Listen To Me And Don't Interrupt, Because What I Have To Say Is Hard For Me.
Okay.
When I Was Your Age, I Would Have Been Lucky To Find A Guy Like You, And I Kind Of Did, But When It Came Down To It, I Thought My Mother Knew Who I Was Much Better Than I Knew Myself.
I'm Not Sure Exactly Who My Daughter Was, But I Know Who She's Become Since She Met You.
She Returns Home Every Night At A Reasonable Hour.
She Doesn't Drink.
She Doesn't Do Drugs.
I Don't Know If You're Responsible For That, But I Don't Think It's A Coincidence.
You Belong With My Daughter, And I Think Everyone Should Know That.
Will You Come With Me? Yes, Mrs.
Van Der Woodsen.
I Would Love To.
Good.
And It's Lily.
Have You Seen Nate? Nate Was Asked To Leave, But Here I Am.
I Know That Look.
That's Your Look When Your Plan Falls Into Place.
You're Enjoying This.
You Knew Carter Was Going To My House.
You Tipped Off Gossip Girl.
You Ruined My Cotillion On Purpose.
You Did All This For Your Own Enjoyment And Didn't Care What It Would Do To Me, Which Is Exactly Why You And I Could Never Work.
Wait.
Slow Down There, Waldorf.
You Make Me Sick.
This Thing Between Us- It's Over For Good.
Look, Blair, Wait.
I Didn't Mean To- Don't Talk To Me.
Blair! That Was Quite A Mess You Made, But I Was Able To Clean It Up.
The Chairs Agreed To Reissue Your Presentation Statement In The Committee's Winter Newsletter.
I Stood Up For You.
What Are You Talking About? With Dan-I Defended You.
Mm, We'll Talk About That Later.
No, We Don't Need To Talk At All, Grana.
A.
I Just Want To Know One Thing.
Are You Even Ill? No.
(Chuckles) But I Could Be.
All Those Cigarettes And Cocktails.
Why Did You Do This? Oh, Serena.
There Is So Much You Don't Understand.
A Woman Has To Earn The Right To Create Her Own Rules.
Things Aren't The Way They Were When You Were Young, Grandma.
You May Be Right About That.
Hey.
Have You Seen Blair Waldorf? Up There.
It Was So Hot How You Punched Carter Out.
I'd Never Seen You Do Anything Like That Before.
Spotted- Chuck Bass Losing Something No One Knew He Had To Begin With- His Heart.
Mom, I'm Sorry.
I Thought I Could Make It In Time.
Yeah, I Know.
I Accept Your Apology, But It Doesn't Really Make It Okay.
Sweetie.
Honey, As You Get Older, Every Choice That You Make Defines Who You're Gonna Turn Into, So Rather Than Apologizi To Me, You Need To Look At Yourself And Ask If You Like The Person You're Becoming.
We're Not Supposed To Talk, Remember? Oh, I Had To.
I- Your Mother Came To See Me, And She Mentioned Something About Why You Left Me All Those Years Ago.
Oh.
Yes, Well, She Made Me An Offer I Couldn't Refuse, And I Wasn't Strong Enough Then.
Why Didn't You Tell Me? Oh, Come On.
You Never Would Have Understood.
But If I Had Known You Hadn't Actually Left Me For-For Him, I- I I Mean, Maybe- Listen, Don't.
Don't.
Don't Say It.
(Chuckles) Don't Even Think It.
I Can't Help Myself.
I Never Should Have Let You Let Me Go.
It's Often Said That No Matter The Truth, People See What They Want To See.
Some People Might Take A Step Back And Find Out They Were Looking At The Same Big Picture All Along.
Some People Might See That Their Lies Have Almost Caught Up To Them.
* I Said It's Too Late To Apologize * * It's Too Late * * Yeah, Yeah, Yeah * * I'd Take Another Chance, Take A Fall * * Take A Shot For You * * Mm, I Need You Like A Heart Needs A Beat * * But It's Nothing New * * Yeah, Yeah * * I Loved You With A Fire Red * * Now It's Turning Blue And You Say Sorry * * Like The Angel Heaven Let Me Think Was You * Some People May See What Was There All Along.
* It's Too Late To Apologize * And Then There Are Those Other People- The Ones Who Run As Far As They Can So They Don't Have To Look At Themselves.
Where To, Mr.
Bass? The Airport.
And As For Me? I Can See Clearly Now.

How's your mom doing?

  Blair
My dad left her for another man.

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPRHEYS]

  Dan
Something about mom and her neighbor.

  Rufus
Yeah, it's complicated.

[Jenny walks in]

  Dan
Mom's having an affair. It's easy for me to say it.

[INT THE HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS]

  Alison
It happened one time and it's over.

  Rufus
And why did our daughter have to go to Hudson and drag you back here?

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Rufus kisses Lily, Bart sees them]

  Rufus
I'm sorry I kissed you but I did it because I thought he should know how it feels to loose you.

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL]

  Bart
So, when can we go public?

  Lily
My kids have to know first.

[EXT NEW YORK]

  Dan
My friend Vanessa, she moved away to Vermont last year... now she's back.

[INT BLAIR'S BIRTHDAY PARTY - Serena is talking to Vanessa]

You guys just have everything in common and, uhm, I'm just getting to know him.

END OF TEASER

[EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - Bazaar - Jenny sings in a choir]
Choir
Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue, I'll wait up for you dear... Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight...

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Hey, Upper East Siders. It's christmas in New York and along with the season comes the Constance Billard and St. Jude's Bazaar where the only thing bizarre are the donated items for sale.

[Dan and Serena are walking through the bazaar]

  Dan
What about an antice butter churn?

  Serena
Oh my gosh, that would go so well with my loom.

[Serena picks up a fur hat and puts it on Dan's head]

  Serena
I know what I'm getting you for christmas now.

  Dan
Oh, for when I move to Siberia?

  Serena
No...

  Dan
Come on, New York doesn't even get cold anymore and it never snows. You know my chest hurts more than open fire when it feels like Florida.

  Serena
Ok, global-warming-grinch.

  Dan
I'm just saying, christmas should be white and snowy... or even set off Manhattan's sludge.

[Vanessa walks towards them]

  Vanessa
There you are!

  Dan
Hey, Vanessa, what are you doing here?

  Serena
Hey.

  Vanessa
Merry christmas!

[Vanessa hands Dan a rolled up issue of 'The New Yorker']

  Dan
This is a copy of 'The New Yorker'. Thank you. But you know I already have a subsription.

  Vanessa
There's something else in there... a letter. What does it say Serena?

[Vanessa takes the magazine back and lets Serena pull out a letter which she reads out loud]

  Serena
Dear Mr. Humphrey, we are pleased to advise you we would like to publish you short-story in our 'Summer Fiction' issue featuring '20 under 20'!

  Vanessa
It's a contest for young unknown writers and I might have submitted you.

[Dan takes the letter]

  Dan
Oh my god, I'm gonna be published! I mean 'The New Yorker'... this can't be... this can't be real, is this... is this real?

  Serena
This is so great! I haven't even read one of your stories.

  Vanessa
Don't worry he doesn't show them to anyone. I swipped this one out of his drawer in the pretence of borrowing a stapler.

  Dan
Click. You have to return that stapler by the way.

[Serena takes the letter back]

  Serena
Let's see, your story is called '10-8-05'. What's that date?

  Dan
Vanessa, thank you, I don't know how you did this but this is the best present ever.
Choir
... So hurry down the chimney tonight... hurry... tonight, Santa baby.

[Rufus and Alison get out of a cab and enter the bazaar]

  Rufus
I can't believe we just took a cab for $32.

  Alison
Oh, I can't believe you were gonna wait an hour for another subway.

  Rufus
They said another train was on its way.

[Alison makes her way through the crowed and passes Lily and Bart]

  Alison
Excuse me... pardon me.

  Lily
Rufus, Alison, hello.

  Alison
Hey!
Oh, Rufus, uh, you remember... my friend Bartholomew Bass.

  Bart
Hi, from, uh, Eleanor's.

[Rufus and Bart shake hands]
Yeah, hello.

  Alison
Eleanor's?

  Rufus
Oh, this is my wife Alison.

  Alison
Hi.

[Alison and Bart shake hands]

  Bart
How do you do.

  Lily
Well, it's lovely to see you both. Excuse us, please.

[Lily and Bart walk away]

  Alison
I guess Lily has targeted her next billionaire.

  Rufus
Actually, I think she had him in her sights for a while.

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - HALLWAY]

  Lily
Well, that was awkward.

  Bart
It wouldn't be if you let people know what we are doing together.

  Lily
I'm just starting to trust you again.

  Bart
And the reason you didn't trust me last time was because of a misunderstanding.

  Lily
Yes, and to avoid another one, please understand that if it doesn't work out between us again I'm gonna feel twice as humiliated.

  Bart
Not telling people about us ensures that we don't work out. Look, when I committed myself to you I meant it. You know I am in love with you. What are you waiting for?

[Blair walks towards them, she is holding two big candy canes]

  Lily
Blair! Oh, happy holidays!

  Blair
Happy holidays, Miss van der woodsen.

[Lily and Blair kiss each other on the cheeks]

  Blair
Mister Bass, I didn't think you were still in town... I figured you were...

  Bart
... with Charles. No, sadly I'm stuck here on business while he suns himself at my hotel in Monaco. I have my staff keeping an eye on him and I'll join him for New Year's.

  Blair
Oh, right, I... I uhm... was wondering why he's been so quiet... and Monaco answers my question. Lovely to see you two. Bye.

[Blair walks off, she sends a text message to Chuck: 'Monaco huh? Anything I need to know']

[Serena walks up behind her]

  Serena
Blair! Tere you are.

  Blair
I can't talk right now, Serena. I'm late and I have...

[Serena points at the candy canes]

  Serena
... a huge sweet tooth?

  Blair
They're for my dad and me, we get them every year. And he landed from Paris 27 minutes ago.

[Serena walks towards the exit and drags Blair with her]

  Serena
Oh, then vite, vite, I parle while you marche. Come on, I said vite!

[They exit the bazaar and Blair hails for a cab but it drives right by]

  Blair
Hey! Nice holiday spirit, Scrooge

  Serena
Oh gosh, it's gonna be a real Waldorf christmas?

  Blair
A real Waldorf chistmas eve. Eleanor drew the line at christmas day. That's only for me, her and Doherta.

  Serena
Well, you still have a couple of days with your dad.

  Blair
No, it will be more than just a couple of days. I'm gonna convince him to stay in New York.

  Serena
What about Paris and Roman?

  Blair
Roman is a phase. My father belongs here with me. He only left New York to ride out the scandal.

  Serena
Oh.

[Serena and Blair hail for a cab]

  Blair
Time to come home, don't you think? Didn't you want to ask me something?

  Serena
Yes, a gift idea for Dan... now that Vanessa got him the most thoughtful DaNate
like present ever.

  Blair
Why don't you just buy him a new outfit for Cedric and call it a day?

  Serena
Thank you for being totally not helpful at all?

[Blair shrugs and gets into the cab]

  Serena
See you tomorrow night.

  Blair
Bye.

[The cab drives off]

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Blair runs towards her father, Harold]

  Harold
Blair-bear!

[They hug]

  Harold
Oh, look at you. More beautiful than ever. Sweetheart, you remember Roman.

[Roman, Harold's boyfriend, enters]

  Roman
Blair, you are still perfection.

[Roman hugs Blair who is less then enthusiastic about it]

  Roman
Delicate, yet full with flavour... like a macaron.

[Roman hands her a box of macaron, Eleanor walks in]

  Eleanor
Imagine my surprise when the elevator door opened and out popped both of them.

  Harold
Well, I didn't think you'd mind.

[Harold points at Roman and Blair]

  Harold
It's the perfect opportunity for you two to get to know each other better.

  Blair
Absolutely. This is for you.

[Blair hands one of the candy canes to her father]

  Harold
Sweetheart, you remembered. It's our tradition.

[Blair hands the other one to Roman]

  Blair
This is for you.

  Roman
Merci, Blair.

  Blair
My pleasure.

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - Rufus is holding the letter from 'The New Yorker', Alison is decorating the christmas tree]

  Rufus
My son, the writer.

  Alison
Published writer.

  Jenny
You got your dreamgirl and you're storming 'The New Yorker'... maybe you should just die now.

  Dan
It's true... I may have peaked.

[Dan opens the mail]

  Dan
This one's from the Smiths: Season's Greetings. It's their original.

  Jenny
The name is Smith, you don't have to be original.

  Dan
This one is from, uh, Alex.

  Alison
What?

  Dan
Alison, meet me on the 24th...

  Alison
No, Dan...

  Dan
And that's not a christmas card.

[Rufus stares at Alison and then takes Alex's letter from Dan, he walks back to Alison and they start whispering]

  Rufus
Why is he writing to you? Sending cards to the house, asking you to see you?

  Alison
I don't know.

  Dan
You guys we're... we're still here. We can hear you.

  Alison
Rufus, it's over with Alex. Ok? I'm home now with my family.

  Rufus
Good.

[Rufus turns around and sighs loudly]

  Rufus
Let's all rewind and just pretend this never happened. This is not gonna ruin our christmas.

[EXT CENTRAL PARK - Harold and Roman are walking a few steps behind Eleanor and Blair, Harold and Blair are carrying ice skates]

  Blair
I can't believe you're ok with this.

  Eleanor
Who said I am ok with this. What am I supposed to do? Make a scene and then behave like some pathetic scorned wife? No!

  Blair
Roman doesn't even know how to ice-skate! Can't you escort him out of the park on your way to your meeting... and you drop him at a nail saloon?

  Eleanor
I can not bother myself trying to wrestle Roman away from you. I have to mentally prepare. I am meeting with the CEO of Victoria Secret, after all!

  Roman
Victoria Secret?

  Eleanor
Yes. I'm... I'm designing a line of retro-chic sleepwear and lingerie...

  Blair
I am looking forward to the samples. We're all very proud. In fact, mom, why don't you tell Roman all about it? I'm sure he will be fascinated.

[Eleanor and Roman walk off together, Blair stays behind with her father]

  Blair
So good to have you here.

  Harold
Well, it's good to be here. Now, where's the handsome Nate? Am I gonna see him tonight?

  Blair
Well, he is in Connceticut with his mom. He said he will try to catch a train to make it to the party tonight.

  Harold

  Ah, well, an Eleanor Waldorf soire
Another New York institution I miss.

  Blair
You know, you don't have to miss any of it.

  Harold
Well, I wish I could be in two places at once, my dear, but... impossible, sorry. You know that chteau near Lyonne that I told you about?

  Blair
Mhm.

  Harold
Well, Roman and I bought it.

  Blair
You bought that place?

  Harold
Yes.

  Blair
And with Roman?

  Harold
The house is flooded with light, the fireplaces are big enough you can walk into them, the gardens are incroyable.

[A man, Jack, and his niece walk up to Eleanor and Blair]

  Jack
Uh, pardon me. I'm taking my niece skating and I can't seem to locate the rink.

  Eleanor
But... it's right over there.

[Eleanor points behind him, Jack turns around]

  Jack
'Course, the crownd of children inmitten should have tipped me off. Thank you.

  Eleanor
You're welcome.

[Jack stares for a moment at Eleanor but then walks off with his niece]

  Roman
The handsome man was just flirting with you.

  Eleanor
That's absurd... he was not flirting with me.

[Roman grins and Eleanor hits him with her purse]

[EXT CENTRAL PARK - ICE RINK]

  Eleanor
Roman, it is going to be so dull for you to sit and watch them skate.

  Blair
Yes, why don't you to the petting zoo... feed the sheep?

  Roman
Or why don't I join you at the rink? It looks fun.

  Harold
Wonderful!

  Harold
Yes, superb!

  Harold
I get you skates.

[Harold and Roman walk off]

  Harold
See you there.

  Blair
Super!

[Eleanor walks off, Blair stares after her]

[INT COFFEE SHOP - Vanessa is waiting a table and then walks over to Dan who is looking through a bunch of old issues of 'The New Yorker']

  Vanessa
You're not autographing those and sell them on ebay, are you?

  Dan
No, oh no, I'm just checking out some of the previous publishees... and I'm in great company here. It's 'The New Yorker', V! How can I top this? I can't, really. Unless I the raid Oscars for one of your documentaries.

  Vanessa
You got in on your own merit. The only gift I gave you was a liquor stamp. And as for me, the annual Dan Humphrey christmas CD mix is more than enough.

  Dan
Alright, yeah.

[Vanessa walks off, Serena walks into the coffee shop with a bag]

  Dan
Hey! What's in the bag?
Perfection. Look, I know it's not christmas yet but open it, please. I can't wait, I'm too excited!

[Serena gets a box out of the bag and Dan starts to open it]

  Dan
Oh my...

[The box contains an expensive watch with a black leather band]

  Serena
I noticed the other day that you don't wear a watch and then it occurred to me it's because you don't have a watch and you're gonna need one to be punctual for all your meetings with editors and publishers... now that you're a fancy...

[Serena looks at the issues of 'The New Yorker']

  Serena
... and appartently self-important writer.

[Dan looks at the watch and frowns]

  Serena
You don't like it. You want the brown band.

  Dan
No, no, no! I love the band, I love the whole thing... it's just... it'S the most amazing watch I've ever seen... but I can't accept this.

  Serena
What? Oh yes you can! Look, it's more of a gift to me because I had so much fun picking it out for you. You have to.

  Dan
Serena, I buy a book for my dad every christmas. I think the most elaborate gift I've ever given was a pair of rubber boots from L.L.Bean.

  Serena
so then I overdid it?

  Dan
I think even your underdoing it would be overdoing it. Look, uhm, let's... let's set some rules, maybe some helpful guidelines.

  Serena
Fine. Deadline?

  Dan
Ehm, tomorrow morning. Price limit?

  Serena
50 bucks.

  Dan
Alright. May the best gift win.

[Dan kisses Serena and she walks off, taking the watch with her, Vanessa stops her on her way out]

  Vanessa
Hey, uhm...

  Serena
Hey.

  Vanessa
If it's any help I can tell you his favourite used bookshop.

  Serena
That's ok. I think I got it.

[Serena leaves the coffee shop]

[INT BAR - Rufus walks in and goes up to a guy sitting at the counter]

  Rufus
Are you Alex?
Alex
Who are you?

  Rufus
Rufus Hummphrey. Unless you want to be carried out of here you're gonna stay the hell away from my wife.
Alex
Calm down, man.

  Rufus
You send a letter to my wife... in my house where my children live? Whatever you had with her is over.
Alex
Why don't you sit down?

  Rufus
She told you to leave her alone.
Alex
I'm sorry... that's not what she told me a couple of days ago.

  Rufus
Excuse me, you... you spoke to her?

[EXT CENTRAL PARK - ICE RINK - Blair stands at the railing, she looks frustrated, Harold tries to help Roman who stumbles over the ice]

  Harold
You can do it!

  Roman
No!

  Harold
You can do it! Look at all those children... they are skating around effortlessly.

  Roman
Come on, they've got a much shorter way to fall!

  Harold
Blair! Will you help us here? We need you!

  Blair
Just a second! My laces came undone!

[Blair takes out her cell phone and looks at a new text message: From: Chuck, Only 1 question: How did you fake ur virginity for N?]

[Roman stumbles towards Blair]

  Harold
Ready? Now got to Blair. You can do it!

  Roman
Blair! Come give us a lesson!

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Spotted spinning at Wallman Rink: The Blair Capades. All the grace of Nancy Kerrigan but packing the punch of Tonya Harding.

[Blair opens her arms to catch Roman but when he reaches her she trips him up, Roman falls down and Harold hurries towards him]

  Harold
Bravo, Roman. Ca va?

[Harold and Blair help him up, Roman looks at Blair who smiles at him innocently]

  Harold
You're alright?

  Roman
I'm so clumsy. My foot got caught behind her skate.

  Blair
Oh, here let me help you.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - ELEVATOR]

  Blair
I can not believe that daddy decided to stay Roman instead of having tea at the Carlow with me! The ER doctor said he would make a full recovery. Everything is ruined.

  Eleanor
Why would you say that? You and I had a marvelous time.

  Blair
Ah, I'm sorry, mother, it's just not the same. I don't understand how that French fox stole my father and your husband and always seems to come of like a... an innocent lamb.

  Eleanor
Roman was not always so innocent, you know.

  Blair
Really? What's his story?

  Eleanor
Oh, when I first met him he was going out this model named Freddy. And Freddy was a horrible scoundrel.

  Blair
Roman would actually be into somebody like that?

  Eleanor
Into him? He was absolutely infatuated with him. Freddy had him under some kind of spell. I was the one who got him to break out of it and turn his life around. Don't mention Freddy to your father: It is a sore sentiment.

  Blair
Ok. What was Freddy's last name?

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPRHEYS - Rufus gets home, Alison is wrapping presents]

  Alison
Hey, where were you? I tried to call you but your phone was off.

  Rufus
I kept your date for you... with Alex. He is actually a pretty cool guy... other than the fact that he is in love with my wife. He told me about your phone call.

  Alison
He felt that I owed him and explanation and he was right.

  Rufus
And you didn't tell me that because...

  Alison
... because there was nothing to tell. I told Alex that I was back with my family and to stop calling.

  Rufus
Would you have come back... if Jenny wouldn't have shown up to bring you?

  Alison
If I hadn't... would Lily be here right now?

  Rufus
I guess by turning our backs on these other people we thought we could fix ourselves.

  Alison
Maybe other people aren't the problem. Maybe we changed.

  Rufus
And at what point do we admit that no matter how much we want it or how hard we try...

  Alison
... it's just now working.

[INT COFFEE SHOP - Dan is sitting with Jenny who is at her laptop]

  Dan
I know it's been maybe ten minutes since I last asked but you still sure you don't want to talk about it?

  Jenny
Dad said he wouldn't want to ruin christmas. That's what I'm trying to do.

  Dan
Hey, well, just in case you change your mind...

  Jenny
... you're here. I know. Ok, what about this?

[Jenny shows Dan a website: Gourmet Cheese of the Month $600]

  Jenny
Seems like something Serena doesn't have.

  Dan
A year of cheese for 600? Are these people kidding? I could buy a cow for that much money and make my own cheese.

  Jenny
You just said 'Make my own cheese'. That's disgusting!

  Dan
I'm never gonna find this gift for Serena.

  Jenny
Yeah, and your gift must be especially good this year to make up for the rest of her christmas.

  Dan
What do you mean?

  Jenny
She is living in a hotel. You know, how homy can it be? It's not exactly festive. Erik told me they don't even allow trees.
[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Blair is sittin on her bed in front of her laptop, she tries to call Chuck but only gets his voicemail

  Chuck
Leave a message and I may listen it.

  Blair
Chuck, you are not answering my calls... to torture me, I am sure, but please for the love of god do not tell anybody about us. Ok, please? Please.

[Serena walks in, Blair hangs up quickly]

  Serena
Hey, you told me to come right a way. Is everything alright?

  Blair
Yeah.

  Serena
Why aren't you with your dad?

  Blair
Eh, I need your login for your agency's site from your modeling days.

  Serena
My modeling days? I did one print-ad for GAP when I was twelve. What... are you holding an open call or something?

  Blair
I have one specific look in mind.

  Serena
Ah, ok, I don't know if I'm still in here but...

[Serena enters her login information]

  Serena
Well, look at that.

  Blair
Addresses and phone numbers... perfect. Now, I called you an hour ago, btw, you're late.

  Serena
Uhm, you're lucky I'm even here now. It's christmas eve and I still haven't found a gift for Dan. Now all the stores are closing and I'm totally screwed. Do you have any idea what you can buy for under 50 these days?

  Blair
I don't know, uhm, a single entré at a mid-priced restaurant? Three quarters of a DVD box set? Maybe a pair of Woolford stockings?

  Serena
Ah, stockings! Yes, great idea for Dan! Blair, please, this is serious.

  Blair
I don't know... why don't you buy him a gold Ligne 21 De Cartier, resides $4999. He won't now the difference.

[Blair makes a call]

  Serena
What are you doing anyway?

  Blair
I'm booking me a model.

[Blair looks at a website: look book model mangagement, Freddy Parens, 28, 6'1'', New York, Agent: Peltzer, Phone: 212.555.0101, Address: 303 East 88th St., New York NY 10128]

[INT COFFEE SHOP - Serena walks towards Vanessa]

  Serena
Hey. I come to you head in hand, tail between my legs and off my high horse. I spend the entire day searching for the perfect gift for Dan. Now, all the stores are closing and christmas day is looming and, uhm, I need your help.

  Vanessa
I could take this opportunity to gloat but I actually like you. So, let's get down to business. What do you have so far?

  Serena
Uhm, I found a first edition J.R. Hall book, original Italian poster of 'The 400 Blows' and a Mont Blanc Fountain Pen.

  Vanessa
All very thoughtful.

  Serena
And all exceed 50.

  Vanessa
Right. Well, Dan's not really that into things.

  Serena
Which makes shopping for him kind of hopeless. The only thing he wants for christmas is snow. It's not like I could give him that.

  Vanessa
You sure?

[Vanessa put on her jacket and they walk out]

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Eleanor's christmas party takes place, Models in pink outfits are walking through the crowd, giving away presents, Eleanor greets some guests]

  Eleanor
Welcome! Welcome! Hey, I don't know... we've done everything a little untraditional this year.

[She leads them to the christmas tree]

  Eleanor
I don't know if you've heard I'm designing a line of lingerie for Victoria Secret. I walked into the store and I fell in love with this tree.

[She points at an ornatment on the ree which is little boxes of lipstick]

  Eleanor
Isn't the lipstick clever, mmh? Have some egg nog!

[Lily answers her cell phone]

  Lily
Hello?

  Rufus
Hey, it's me.

  Lily
Hey.

[EXT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - Rufus is sitting on the fire escape]

  Rufus
So, uhm, running into each othe at the school fare... kinda awkard.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS]

  Lily
I suppose so. Especially after our last phone call. Rufus, we really shouldn't be speaking.

[EXT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS]

  Rufus
No, I know.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS]

  Lily
But if there's something you wanna say you should go ahead and say it.

[EXT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS]

  Rufus
Is there something you want me to say?

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS]

  Lily
Rufus, why are you calling?

[EXT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS]

  Rufus

  Oh, I... just wanted to say
Merry christmas. Hope you have a good holiday.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS]

  Lily
Yes, well, I'm... uhm, flying to Anguella with Bart tonight, so I'm expecting it to be... a great holiday... one for the ages, in fact. Good night, Rufus. Goodbye...

[Lily hangs up]

  Lily
... and good luck. What's the matter with me?

[Jack enters, carrying a present, Eleanor is talking to a party guest]

  Eleanor
... I don't think so.

[She sees Jack]

  Eleanor
Oh, excuse me.

[She walks over to him]

  Eleanor
What are you doing here?

  Jack
I was hoping to see you again. I thought a great good furtune that Roman track me down at the skating rink and... extended an invitation.

[He hands her the present]

  Eleanor
Oh, well... enjoy the party.

[She walks away and gives the present to the maid, she then confronts Roman who is walking on crutches]

  Eleanor
How dare you inviting strange men into my home!

  Roman
Jack came?

[Roman looks around and waves at Jack who raises his glass in response]

  Roman
Go talk to him. Bring vodka.

  Eleanor
Roman, you practically picked him up off the street.

  Roman
And then I googled him: His name is Jack Roth, he owns a prominent hedge fund with offices in London and Barcelona... and he finds you very attractive.

  Eleanor
Well, that's no... excuse. And... and I'm doing just fine without your romantic help.

  Roman
Are you?

  Eleanor
Mmh?

  Roman
Eleanor, we've been friends for a long time... since before Marc Jacobs went into rehab.

  Eleanor
Friends don't steal other friends' husbands.

[Eleanor walks away]

[Blair is talking on her cell phone]

  Blair
Is Nate there?... Oh, a few hours ago?... A Chuck Bass didn't called for him, did he?... Ah, nevermind... Did Nate say where he was going?... No, no, don't disturb Misses Archibald, uhm, I'm sure he's on his way here now. Alright, thank you.

[BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Serena and Erik are sitting on Blair's bed, cutting silhouettes out of paper, Vanessa is sitting on the comforter with a laptop in her lap, Blair walks in]

  Blair
Doherta is gonna kill you if you get glow on that comforter.

  Serena
Sorry, we've turned your room into an art studio, B. But the clock is ticking.

  Vanessa
I'm done.

[Vanessa shows them something on the laptop]

  Erik
Wow.

  Serena
Oh gosh. Wow, this... this is amazing. Thank you so much, Vanessa. This is gonna be incredible.

  Vanessa
Good, I'm glad I could help. I think he'll really love it.

  Blair
Vanessa, I think I'd like to help with this little project. Would you come and help me find another pair of scissors?

[Blair leads Vanessa into the bathroom, she closes the door behind her and picks up a pair of scissors]

  Blair
It's so nice what you are doing for your friend Dan. Helping his girlfriend make his christmas present. Serena is so greatful because... she likes to see the best in people. I like to see the truth.

  Vanessa
Yeah? And what's that?

  Blair
I think you like Dan a little too much. Just thought I should let you know someone's watching. Merry christmas.

[Vanessa walks out of the bathroom]

  Vanessa
I'm taking off. Call me when you're done.

  Serena
Ok, where are you going?

[Vanessa walks out of the room withou answering, Blair comes back from the bathroom too]

  Blair
I'm gonna go check on my daddy.

  Erik
I thought you were gonna help?

  Blair
I think my help is done here.

[Lily walks in]

  Lily
Oh, hello!

  Blair
Hi!

[Blair leaves]

  Lily
Goodbye.

[Lily turns to Serena and Erik]

  Lily
When you two are done hiding up here I'm taking you both out to dessert.

  Serena
Mom, I'm busy.

  Lily
But this is important for our family! It'll be just the three of us.

  Serena
Mom, any time you say it'll be just the three of us it means you're dating someone new. Whoever it is, I don't care. I won't see him anyway.

  Lily
Fine, fine. Then I'll just tell you who it is because you're gonna seeing him around from now on. It's Bart Bass.
Serena and Erik
Bart Bass?

  Serena
Mom, you can not date Bart Bass!

  Lily
You just said a moment ago you didn't care who it was!

  Serena
That was before I knew who it was.

  Erik
He only has one facial expression: He scares me.

  Serena
And he raised Chuck: That scares me.

  Lily
Oh, Serena, as usual you're being overly dramatic. I'm not marrying Bart. This is very casual. And regardless, I'm not asking your permission.

[Lily leaves, Serena and Erik look at each other]

[EXT NEW YORK - Dan and Jenny are carrying a christmas tree down the street]

  Jenny
You know, when I suggested this plan I didn't know that it would entail robbery.

  Dan
Hey, hey! I left a donation. So it was more of a rescue than a robbery. You know, those abandoned trees would just be kicking it after christmas. And this tree we have here will be loved and admired.

  Jenny
Well, you have a real talent for spinning, my brother. Ok...

[Jenny puts her end of the tree on the side-walk, Dan does too]

  Dan
I wish you had more talent for heavy lifting.

  Jenny
Well, what you are doing for Serena is really romantic. I wonder what mom and dad are getting each other for christmas.

[Dan stares at Jenny]

  Jenny
I thought that if I brought them under the same roof that things would go back the way they were. They haven't, have they?

  Dan
I think there's a real possibility that they might split up.

  Jenny
If I hadn't... brought her back though, we could've just kept pretending that she's just in Hudson doing her art.

[Dan hugs her]

  Dan
You did the right thing, Jen. Really, you did. 'Cause what happens now... at least we're not living a fantasy, you know.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Blair is lying on the couch texting, Eleanor takes one of the presents the models hand out and helps herself to another glass of champagne]

  Party Guest
Wonderful party, Eleanor.

[Eleanor walks over to Jack]

  Eleanor
So, you ice skate.

  Jack
Well, occasionally... with my niece. But she's much more talented than I am.

  Eleanor
Here.

[She hands him the present]

  Eleanor
I haven't skated since... ages... but I used to love it when I was a girl.

  Jack
You must be very beautiful out there on the ice.

[The elevator doors open and Freddy, Roman's ex-boyfriend, enters, he gets a glass of champagne, he bumps into one of the guests]

  Freddy
Excuse me.

[He greets some other guests in passing]

  Freddy
Merry christmas.

[Eleanor spots him]

  Eleanor
Excuse me.

[She walks over to him]

  Eleanor
Freddy, what on earth are you doing here?

  Freddy
Roman invited me.

  Eleanor
What? [Harold notices Freddy too, Roman limps towards him too]

  Roman
Freddy, what... what are you doing here?

  Eleanor
He said that you invited him.

  Roman
What?

[Blair watches the scene from the couch]

  Harold
Freddy! Roman, explain this.

  Roman
I can't.

  Freddy
It's so true. How does one explain the undescribable pull to see an old lover, to feel that jolt of electricity.

  Harold
You couldn't last two days in town without contacting him!

  Roman
I can't believe you trust appearances and not me!

[Roman limps away]

  Eleanor
Harold, dear, Roman did not invite Freddy. I think Blair did.

  Harold
Blair?

[Harold and Eleanor both look at Blair]

  Eleanor
Freddy, if you want to be the featured model in my spring catalogue you better tell us the truth.

  Freddy
She might have offered to buy me a cruise... and renew my gym membership.

  Eleanor
Well, you might as well take that cruise because you will be featured in my catalogue when hell freezes over. Now, please, get out.

  Freddy
Thanks for the champagne.

  Eleanor
Merry christmas.

[Freddy walks off, Harold and Eleanor turn back to Blair]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Looks like daddy's little girl isn't sugar and spice and everything nice after all.

[Eleanor leads Harold away from the other guests]

  Eleanor
I'd wish you would just slow down for a second and let her be.

  Harold
I just can't understand why Blair would do something so cruel! And to Roman... who was only completely kind to her.

  Eleanor
It isn't Roman Blair is lashing out at... it's you. She was hoping for spending time with you all alone... and then you show up at her doorstep... with your lover. Without a word of warning! How did you expect her to react?

  Harold
Well, I hoped that when we were together we would all... work out. I suppose that was pretty naive.

  Eleanor
Blair learned scheming from her mother and unrealistic dreaming from her father. She tries really hard to act all grown up but don't you be fooled... she's still a little girl... who needs her daddy.

[EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Dan and Jenny carry the christmas tree towards the hotel]

  Jenny
Ok, stop, stop, stop!

[They put the tree down, both are breathing heavily, Dan stretches his back]

  Jenny
Ok, what now?

  Dan
Now you go in there, you distract Dexter, the humourless concierge...

  Jenny
Right.

  Dan
... while I try to sneak this into an elevator.

  Jenny
Alright.

[Dan tries to lift the tree by himself]

  Jenny
who is gonna turn you into Hercules? You can't carry this thing by yourself.

  Dan
I... I did not say the plan was foolproof.

  Jenny
Yeah.

[Lily walks up to them]

  Dan
Eh, Miss van der Woodsen... eh, Lily! Hi!

  Lily
Dan, Jenny...

  Jenny
Hi!

  Lily
... tree!

  Dan
Yeah, ehm, they don't allow christmas trees inside... which is why we're out here...

  Jenny
... which is why Dan is about to ask you for a favour.

  Lily
Ah, does it involve distracting Dexter and sneaking into the elevator?

  Dan
Why, would that work?

  Lily
No, never. He has the eyes of a hawk and he takes his job very seriously.

  Dan
So I've noticed.

  Lily
But Bobby at the service entrance... I think he can be bought.

[Dan and Jenny smile]

  Lily
Come!

[INT THE HUMPHREY'S ART GALLERY - Serena and Vanessa are standing between some big boxes, Serena is texting]

  Serena
I just send him a text and Dan is on his way. Thank you so much.

  Vanessa
It's really no problem... and since there are no problems I should go.

[Vanessa grabs her jacket and purse]

  Serena
Oh, no, no, no, stay! Please!

  Vanessa
You don't need me. We talked about how to turn everything on.

  Serena
No, I know I can do it but I just want you to see Dan's face.

  Vanessa
I really got to get going.

  Serena
Ok, well, I'll tell him how much you did.

  Vanessa
Please, don't. It's your present... just... enjoy your night.

[Vanessa walks out but turns around for a moment, she looks back and sees Serena all excited, she then walks off]

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Blair tries to call Nate but she only reaches his voicemail]

  Nate
Hey, this is Nate. I can't come...

[Blair hangs up, her father knocks on the open door and enters]

  Harold
May I come in? Our flight leaves in a few hours and I wanted to say goodbye.

[He walks over to her bed and sits down next to her]

  Harold
Please forgive me, Blair. I should have told you I was bringing Roman. I know that having him here would be hard for you but I love you so much and I love Roman and I was hoping if we were all thrown together that... something... perfect would happen and that you would love him too.

  Blair
I was gonna convince you to move back to New York but... you bought a vineyard... in France... with Roman. What's next? The commitment ceremony?

[Harold nods his head slightly]

  Blair
Great! There is no room in your life for me anymore.

  Harold
Sweetheart, there is always room for you. No matter where I am, no matter who I'm with.

[He kisses her on the forehead]

  Harold
Now, here...

[He pulls out a wrapped CD from behind his back]

  Harold
... this is part of your christmas gift.

[Blair and Harold are looking at the photos on the CD on her laptop: a vineyard, a swimming pool, an old house]

  Blair
Your house in France. It's very nice, daddy. I'm sure you and Roman will totally enjoy it.

  Harold
And so will you... because this... is your room.

  Blair
It's beautiful.

[There's a picture of a bedroom: the room is flooded with light, a big bed with white sheets, a wooden desk and a chair are standing at the end of the bed and there is a picture of Audrey Hepurn hanging over the bed]

  Harold
We had it decorated just for you.

[There's a picture of Roman holding a cat]

  Blair
A cat!

  Harold
A cat... named Cat... like in your favourite movie. It was Roman's idea. So, merry christmas, sweetheart. I hope you're gonna spend the whole summer with us.

[Blair smiles]

[INT THE HUMPHREY'S ART GALLERY - A video is projected onto the walls: a forest covered in snow, it is snowing, there are ventilators which blow artificial snow into the gallery, Dan enters and sees Serena sitting on a mattress in the middle of the room]

  Serena
Merry christmas! Do you like it? Do you think it's cheesy?

  Dan
No, no, no, it's incredible. How did you do this?

  Serena
Well, I had help from my elves.

[Dan sits down next to Serena]

  Dan
Your present is waiting for you at home but, ehm, I did bring a little pre-present for you.

[Dan hands her a folded pack of papers, she unfolds them: 10-8-05, I was accidentially invited to a birthday party. I met a girl there. She spoke two sentences to me. And I never forgot her. Her name was Serena and she was the most beautiful girl I ever met. Excited and keen about the whole thing she could have got started again if it hadn't been for her enthusiasm and hard work. He was an enourmous help to her. She was detailed by the Commitee to live on a farm. He showed me a card which stated he was a communicant by the church. I replied. I should make inquieries as to whether the tears freed him. Her house was situated in the middle of the plantations on the slope or a mill with paired paddocks at the side and there were good...]

  Serena
Hey, this is your story.

  Dan
It's the original. It is right out of the spiral notebook.

  Serena
I'm kinda scared to read it. What happened on October 8th, 2005?

  Dan
Ehm, well, I was accidentially invited to a birthday perty... where I met a girl. She only spoke two sentences to me but I've never forgotten her.

  Serena
Wait, your story is about me?

[Dan nods slightly and then leans in to kiss her, Serena loosens one strap of her dress and then the other]

  Dan
Are we really gonna do this?

  Serena
Yeah.

[They kiss again and lie down, a look through the skylight shows the night sky, it is snowing outside]

[EXT NEW YORK - It's the next morning and it's still snowing]

[INT THE HUMPRHEY'S ART GALLERY - Dan and Serena are lying naked under the sheets]

  Dan
Hey, your crafts were impressive but... how did you manage the real snow?

  Serena
I'm well connected.

  Dan
This is without question the best christmas ever.

  Serena
Ever. Merry christmas.

  Dan
I hate to break the spell but, eh, we better get home before our families wake up.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDROFS - LIVING ROOM - Eleanor and Jack are coming down the stairs, Eleanor is wearing a nightgown and a satin bathrobe, Jack kisses her]

  Jack
Eleanor, you're a marvel.

  Eleanor
Oh god...

[He kisses her again]

  Eleanor
If I knew there were men like you wandering around Central Park lost.

[Harold and Roman enter with their bags in hand]

  Eleanor
Oh!

  Harold
Eleanor, good morning. And Jack, nice to see you.

  Jack
Good morning.

  Roman
Yes, wonderful.

  Harold
The flights were all cancelled because of the weather. I wanted to tell Blair in person. Do not worry, we... we have a room at The Pierre.

  Eleanor
No, it's nonsense. You'll... stay with us.

  Harold
Thank you.

[Eleanor walks Jack to the elevator]

  Eleanor
So, call me later?

  Jack
Oh, yes.

  Eleanor
I'll be spending christmas with my family.

  Jack
Bye.

[Jack enters the elevator and leaves, Blair comes down the stairs]

  Blair
What's going on?

  Harold
We're back for christmas.

  Blair
Well, Roman, you are in for a treat because a Waldorf christmas is like no other.

[Blair touches Roman's arm, Eleanor takes Harold's hand]

  Eleanor
Come on, you.

[Harold kisses her hand]

  Eleanor
Oh!

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - ROOM OF THE VAN DER WOODSENS - Serena enters and finds a christmas tree in the suite, it is decorated with a chain of lights and a big red ribbon on top]

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPRHEYS - Dan comes home, Rufus is making breakfast]

  Dan
Merry christmas, dad! You're up early.

  Rufus
And you are getting in awefully late.

  Dan
Oh, yeah. Well, I left you a message.

  Rufus
Saying the tree-shenanigans were taking all night... but I didn't think you meant literally all night. Oh, yeah, yeah, the tree... it was a big production. Luckily, Serena's mom was there to help with the plan.

  Rufus
Lily was there? I thought you mentioned she was out of the country.

  Dan
No, no, they're here. They're gonna see the Nutcracker tomorrow.

[Jenny and Alison enter]

  Jenny
Do I smell chocolate chip waffles?

  Rufus
With hot caramel sauce!

  Alison
You're father's christmas specialty.

  Jenny
Dan, pass the chocolate chips.

[Dan hands her the bowl]

  Dan
Good morning.

  Jenny
Good morning.

  Rufus
After breakfast and presents I need to go to the gallery... take care of some stuff.

  Jenny
On christmas morning?

  Rufus
Well, yeah, you know... work never sleeps.

  Alison
But, you know, the three of us can hang out together. It will be great: We will drink hot coco and watch a movie and then when your dad comes back we'll all go for a walk.

[EXT NEW YORK - It is still snowing]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Hear those silver bells? It is christmas time in the city. Some families actually do make the yule time gay... managing to leave their troubles far away.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Harold, Roman, Eleanor, Blair and Doherta are all sitting together unwrapping gifts, Blair is trying on a new coat]

  Blair
Oh, it's beautiful! Thank you, thank you!

  Roman
You look like a brunette Catherine Deneuve. Elle est manifique.

  Blair
It is so gorgeous!

[Harold takes a new sweater out of a parcel, Eleanor is drinking champagne and eating strawberries, Doherta is opening her parcel, it contains a blackberry]

  Blair
Merry christmas, Doherta. So we can text. Do you like it?

  Doherta
Thank you, Miss Blair.

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPRHEYS - Dan, Jenny and Alison are unwrapping presents]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Other families have a merry little christmas even when their troubles aren't so far away.

  Dan
So, what did dad have to do at the gallery exactly?

  Alison
Eh, paper work, I think.

  Jenny
You are going back to Hudson, aren't you?

  Alison
Yeah. But hey, we are going to be ok. Come here.

[Alison hugs Jenny]

  Dan
We know. It's alright.

[Dan joins in the hug]

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - ROOM OF THE VAN DER WOODSENS - Lily and Serena are sitting on the couch, Erik holds his present form Bart, it's a T-shirt which reads: Marlins]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Some presents might end up getting returned.

  Bart
I know how you like Florida.

  Erik
Yeah, wow, Eh, number one fan! You know, I'm sorry I didn't get anything for you, Mister Bass, but eh, I didn't know you would be coming for christmas.

  Bart
Ah, no worries, Erik. Please, call me Bart.

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
But some gifts are for keeps.

[Serena gets up and gives Erik his present]

  Serena
For you!

  Erik
Thank you.

  Bart
Erik, Serena, I just want you to know that I have deep feelings for your mother.

[Lily's cell phone starts ringing]

  Serena
Mom, your phone.

  Bart
Eh, Lily, you're not wanna interupt this moment.

[Lily rejects the call and Bart sits down next to her, he takes a small box out of his pocket]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Other presents come when you least expect them.

[EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Rufus is standing in front of the hotel, he isn't wearing a jacket and he shivers, he leaves Lily a message]

  Rufus
Hey, Lil. You know, everything is closed on christmas. Diners that claim to be open for 24/7... it's false advertising.

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - ROOM OF THE VAN DER WOODSENS - Bart is getting down on one knee and opens the box, it contains a diamond ring]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
And everyone knows the biggest present comes in the smallest box.

[EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Rufus is still on the phone]

  Rufus
So, eh, Alison is leaving. She is spending time alone with the kids. And I seemed to have walked all the way from Brooklyn to your doorstep... without a jacket... in the snow. So, what the hell... I miss you... and I've been missing you for a while.

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - ROOM OF THE VAN DER WOODSENS - Lily stares at the ring, Serena and Erik look at each other]

  Bart
Lily, would you do me the honor of being my wife?

[Lily's cell phone rings, she looks at it: 1 new message]

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Harold is taking a picture of Eleanor, Roman, Blair and Doherta]

  Roman
Fromage!
Eleanor, Blair and Doherta
Cheese!

  Harold
Perfect!

[Blair's cell phone rings, she looks at her new message: From: Chuck, Don't worry, B. Who would I tell]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Then there are those boxes you wish you had never opened.

[Blair looks at the second new message: It's a photo of Chuck hugging Nate on a beach]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Have a holly jolly christmas. XOXO Gossip Girl.

Gossip Girl here. You're one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS]

  Rufus
On what point do we admit that no matter how much we want it or how hard we try...

  Alison
... it's just not working.

  Jenny
You're going back to Hudson, aren't you?

  Alison
Yeah.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Eleanor's christmas party]

  Lily
Rufus, why are you calling?

[EXT THE PALACE HOTEL]

  Rufus
I miss you.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Serena is sitting on Blair's bed]

  Serena
Mom, you can not date Bart Bass!

  Lily
You just said a moment ago you didn't care who it was.

  Serena
He raised Chuck.

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - ROOM OF THE VAN DER WOODSENS - Bart is kneeling in front of Lily holding an open box with a ring inside]

  Bart
Would you do me the honour of being my wife?

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - BATHROOM - Blair is talking to Vanessa]

  Blair
I think you like Dan a little too much. Just thought I should let you know someone's watching.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Chuck and Blair are lying on the bed kissing]
[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Blair is sitting on her bed alone, she is leaving Chuck a voicErik
mail]

  Blair
Chuck, you are not answering my calls. Please, for the love of god, do not tell anybody about us.

[Blair looks at her new text messages: From: Chuck, Don't worry, B. Who would I Tell?, the second message contains a photo of Chuck and Nate in Monaco]
END OF TEASER

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - SWIMMING POOL]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
On the Upper East Side it's easy to think that the world is exactly as it appears: refined, elegant, imposing. But sometimes all it takes is a little key to open the door to the wild side.

[A key falls on the floor, somebody jumps into the swimming pool, there's music playing and a whole bunch of students are partying in the pool, they are drinking and dancing, Blair is in the pool, Nate dives towards her]

  Blair
Nate.

  Nate
Why've you been avoiding me?

  Blair
Avoiding you? What?

[Blair turns around and Nate hugs her]

  Nate
Ever since I came back from Monaco... you've been not returning my calls or my texts... I've barely seen you.

  Blair
Really? I don't recall.

  Nate
Well, do you recall that night after the debutante ball?

  Blair
Yes, I do.

[Nate kisses Blair on the cheek]

  Nate
Blair.

[Blair turns around]

  Blair
What are you doing?

  Nate
This.

[Nate kisses her and she kisses him back]

  Blair
Good catching up.

[Blair swims away, Chuck is sitting on the lifeguard chair and talks to a girl, Blair walks up to him]

  Blair
Enough with the blackmail! Aren't you bored already? I can't avoid Nate forever.

  Chuck
Excuse me.

[Chuck turns away from the other girl who walks away]

  Chuck
I didn't say forever... just until the sight of the two of you together doesn't turn my stomach.

  Blair
And when will that be?

  Chuck
Only time will tell, I'm afraid. So unless you want dear Nathaniel to know how you lost your virginity to me in the back of a moving vehicle I encourage patients and restraint.

  Blair
Isn't there someone else you can torture?

  Chuck
Probably but I choose you.

[Chuck puts on black sunglasses and walks away, Blair sighs, Serena enters the hall, she is wearing a black bathing suit, Chuck walks up to her]

  Chuck
Why don't I turn that, uh, onErik
piece into a no-piece.

  Serena
Find a floaty to talk to, Chuck.

  Chuck
You know, if my dad and your mom come back from South Africa tomorrow engaged... we would be brother and sister... and you know what they say: The family that plays together stays together.

  Serena

  Ah, incest
The universal taboo. One of the only ones you haven't violated.

  Chuck
I want gain a few more.

[Chuck leans forward, Serena leans towards him and hits his glass out of his hand, she walks away]

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - Dan is sitting at the table eating cereal and studying, Vanessa is filming him]

  Vanessa
Dan Humphrey, age 17, enjoying an exotic meal of cheerios on an exciting Saturday night in. Come on, be interessting! You don't want me to move back to Vermont, do you?

  Dan
No, but if your whole future depends on getting this grand for your documentary I... I really, really think you should find a new subject.

  Vanessa
Absolutely not. The outsider goes inside: A likeable everyman's persuit of his dreamgirl begins his into the bowls of hell. This is mystic stuff.

[Guitar music comes from the other room]

  Vanessa
Ok, not big on the soundtrack. Whatever movie he's scoring sounds depressing.

  Dan
I think it's a bio-pic. Try listening to that for three weeks straignt. Right before christmas my dad hadn't finished a song in... years. So, I'm not gonna advice him to stop.

  Vanessa
Well, I do.

[Vanessa walks towards Rufus' room, Dan' phone rings and she stops]

  Dan
Hey Serena.

  Vanessa
Yes, finally some action!

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - SWIMMING POOL]

  Serena
Hey, what are you up to? Besides missing me.

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS]

  Dan
Oh, eh, just wondering if you're missing me.

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - SWIMMING POOL]

  Serena
Oh, of course I am... at this party that would be a lot more fun if you were here.

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS]

  Dan
Party? I thought it was a quiet night with Blair... spending the last night at her place before your mom comes home.

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - SWIMMING POOL]

  Serena
Yeah, we were but then Katie and Is showed up and we all went out... and we ran into some people and then ended up here.

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS]

  Dan
Where... where is here?

  Serena
7 19 East 82nd street.

  Dan
Wait, Serena, that's... that's school, is it not?

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - SWIMMING POOL]

  Serena
Bring your bathing suit.

[Serena hangs up]

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPRHEYS]

  Dan
You're swimming... now you hung up.

  Vanessa
So, what will it be, Dan? Cheerio-intosher or an ilegal party at your prep-school pool with your high society girlfriend and her nasty coeds?

  Dan
Dad, Vanessa and I are... are going out!

  Rufus
Alright!

[Dan winks at Vanessa's camera]

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - SWIMMING POOL - Chuck blows a whistle and points at a girl who then takes her bikini top off, Blair and some others are drinking Martinis in the pool, Dan and Vanessa enter, Vanessa is still filming]

  Dan
Well, if you wanted to get the perfect shot of me feeling like an outsider... I'm ready for my close-up.

[Serena runs up to him and they hug]

  Serena
Dan!

  Dan
Hey!

  Serena
Vanessa, hey! Come on, guys!

[Two students are messing around for fun, one pushes the other who then crashes against a pole and falls into the pool, his unconsious body floats in the pool and there is blood in the water, Nate notices this and pulls him out]

  Nate
Help! someone call an ambulance. Call an ambulance!

[Others help Nate to get the unconscious student out of the pool]

  Dan
Someone call 911!

[Nate starts CPR, Serena calls 911]

  Serena
Hi, we... we need an ambulance... yeah... a kid... he hit is head and he fell in the pool, it's 19 East 82nd street!

[A lot of people stand around Nate performing CPR, some grab their clothes and leave, Chuck takes a key from the table, somebody left their cell phone behind]

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - Photos are shown on a TV: Blair, Katie and Isabel are drinking Martinis in the pool, two girls hugging and smiling, Nate and Chuck and photos of several other students partying]

  St. Jude's Headmaster
Thanks to the cell phone somebody left behind we've got plenty of evidence of who was at the party. Lucky for you, Andrew Collins is going to be fine. Unlucky for you, we need to hold somebody responsible. Miss Queller.

[A woman stands up and addresses the students assembled: Serena, Blair, Katie, Isabel, Nate, Chuck, Dan and several others]

  Miss Queller
Hello. I'm Miss Queller, the new headmistress at Constance. It's unfortunate that we meet under these circumstances... but I look forward to getting to know each and every one of you. I've already talked to your parents... at least those I could reach and look forward to reading your personal essays. 10000 words describing how you came to be on school property after hours, using alcohol and drugs, where a fellow student almost died. In other words: What the hell is wrong with you. I'll also be conducting on Erik and Nate interviews until I discover who broke into the pool and initiated the party... that person will be expelled. If that person is not identified then you all face expulsion.

[EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE]

  Blair
So we all know how this works.

  Chuck
No one talks, no one gets into trouble.

  Nate
Who did break in anyway?

  Chuck
I guess we don't have to worry about Nate cracking under pressure.

  Blair
So we all agree?

[Most students nod, Serena looks at Dan]

  Serena
Agreed.

  Dan
Look, Blair, I know you have your sight set on Yale but this 'Skull and Bones' stuff is a bit much, don't you think?

  Blair
Maybe... but it works... everytime.

[Blair, Nate, Chuck and the others leave, Serena and Dan stay behind]

  Dan
You know, when someone says 'everytime' it sounds like more than a few times.

  Serena
Everything is gonna to be fine.

  Dan
Were't you just in the same assemby as we?

  Serena
Do you really think she is gonna expell two-thirds of the junior class? Look, I got you into this, I'll get you out of it, ok?

[She kisses him]

  Serena
Trust me.

[Serena walks off, Dan looks unhappy]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
There's a weak link in every chain and it's just a matter of time before this one snaps.

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - HEADMISTRESS'S OFFICE]

  Blair
I'm innocent. Well, except for a crime of passion. I did something stupid with someone and even worse than doing that stupid thing I did the same stupid thing with someone else and pretended I had never done that stupid thing before. You look confused... shall I walk you through it?

  Miss Queller
Let's stay on point. I reviewed your record... it's prestine. If Constance has a shining star, it's Blair Waldorf. I would never have expected this from you.

  Blair
I know. I'm the perfect one...

  Miss Queller
Miss Waldorf, who broke into the pool?

  Blair
Like you said, my unfortunate participation in said party was entirely out of character. I don't know anything about it.

[EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - Nate is sitting at a table writing, Chuck walks up to him]

  Chuck
You're taking that paper seriously.

  Nate
This isn't the paper, it's... a heartfelt letter to Blair.

  Chuck
A heartfelt letter? Who spayed you, man? Blair doesn't even want you. She's been crystal about that since we got back.

  Nate
Didn't seem that way when she kissed me at the pool.

  Chuck
She kissed you?

  Nate
Well, I kissed her but... yup.

  Chuck
What was she like? Was she into it or was she more like...

  Nate
Of course she was into it, man, what do you think?

  Chuck
Yeah, I know but... you know Blair.

  Nate
Yes, I do. I think she just wants me to suffer a little more, you know... even the playing field. And it's worth it, believe me.

[EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - Dan leaves the school, his phone rings and he answers it with a little hesitation]

  Dan
Hey, dad, listen, I... eh, got your thousand and one messages I just haven't had a chance to get back at you.

[INT THE HUMPHREY'S ART GALLERY]

  Rufus
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

[EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE]

  Dan
Guess you've heard from the new headmistress.

[INT THE HUMPHREY'S ART GALLERY]

  Rufus
Look, I know how upset you were by everything and apperently some of the kids who were at the party didn't even tell their parents...

[EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE]

  Dan
You don't have to say anything else. I regret even leaving the house Saturday.

[INT THE HUMPRHEY'S ART GALLERY]

  Rufus
Yeah, but if you know something that could keep you out of trouble then you need to cooperate.

[EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE]

  Dan
I don't... really, dad, I don't.

[INT THE HUMPRHEY'S ART GALLERY]

  Rufus
Dan, don't think for a second these other kids aren't gonna be looking out for themselves. You need to do the same, alright?

[Rufus hangs up, Lily enters]

  Lily
I hope I'm not interupting anything? I just got a message that our kids got into some kind of trouble at school.

  Rufus
And you came all the way to Brooklyn to talk about it?

  Lily
No, no, no, not about that! Eh, Bart and I just landed at the airport back from our trip and he proposed and I'm going to say yes. I wanted to hear it from me first... not from my daughter or your son.

  Rufus
Right, the people who actually talk to me.

  Lily
Oh, if you're referring to the message you left me on christmas day... I didn't get it until we were already on the plane. It was very... endearing though.

  Rufus
But not enough to turn the G5 around.

  Lily
You missed me, that's great. I miss you too. What? You kissed me at Eleanor's party and then you say you can't see me anymore because your wife came home and then... you call and say you should have never let me go and then you're back with Alison again.

  Rufus
I didn't plan any of that.

  Lily
That is just it with you, Rufus... You don't ever plan anything.

  Rufus
Well, I'm sure that your current plan will be full of private jets and five star hotels.

  Lily
Take care, Rufus.

[Lily leaves]

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - ELEVATOR - Vanessa is looking at the footage she shot on her camera]

  Dan
You really need to show this to me now?

  Vanessa
Trust me when I say you wanna see this before you enter Blair Waldorf's evil lair.

  Dan
It's a homework group, Vanessa. We're just gonna be writing our papers, you know.

  Vanessa
Here. I wasn't sure what it was until I got home and saw it on the computer but...

[Dan looks at the screen and looks at footage Vanessa shot at the pool party: Chuck takes a key from a table]

  Dan
That's Chuck. What... what are you holding here?

  Vanessa
It's a key.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - The elevator doors open and Dan and Vanessa enter the living room, there's loud music playing, people are playing cards, drinking and talking]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)

  Spotted
Lonely boy learning that when the punishment fits the crime there's no reason you can't serve your sentence in style.

[Serena walks over to Dan]

  Serena
Yay, you're here!

  Dan
I thought we were gonna work on our papers?

[Blair walks by with a tray full of drinks]

  Blair
We are! One night at Balvokay, Courtney made out with a guy in the Cornell ethics program... they're getting tips now.

[Blair looks at Vanessa who's filming everything]

  Blair
I thought I told you, you can't film here!

[Vanessa walks around, still filming, Serena turns to Serena and they walk a few steps away]

  Blair
Come here. You are so naive. Michael Moore over there is obviously just using this film to get close to Dan.

  Serena
No, she needs that grand, B.

[Blair shakes her head and walks away, Serena goes back to Dan]

  Serena
So, did you bring your legal pen? You wait here, I find us a quiet place to work.

  Dan
Ok.

[Serena walks off, Chuck is lying on the couch looking at the key with chain, Dan and Blair see it]

  Blair
I can't believe you brought that here. It's evidence. Give it to me.

[She snaps it from him and walks upstairs, the elevator doors open and Nate enters, he is holding the letter he wrote, he sees Blair going to her room, Dan walks over to Chuck]

  Dan
Chuck, you need to tell the truth.

  Chuck
Whatever happened to 'don't speak until spoken to'?

  Dan
I just saw you with that key. I know you had it at the party.

  Chuck
Poor little Humphrey-Dumpty Look, let me clearify something for you. Regardless of who you're currently sleeping with, you and I come from different worlds. In my workd, if I'm suspended or expelled a wing is donated in the Bass name.

  Dan
That does sound like quite a world.

  Chuck
Well, it's not perfect, I admit. But one thing it does offer in spades is security. My family can take care of me. What do the Humphrey's have to offer? Used metro cards? Your dad's gesinge?

[Chuck stands up]

  Chuck
And in case you're wondering, you narc: I only took the key from the party to hide it so we can all get blamed... including you.

[BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Blair enters and throws the keychain into the wastepaper basket, she then puts the key into the drawer of her desk, Nate enters]

  Nate
Blair!

  Blair
Nate, what are you doing here?

  Nate
I wanted to talk to you. I brought you this: It's a love letter.

  Blair
Hostess can't hide in her room. It's unladylike.

[Blair walks out, Nate stays behind and throws the letter onto the desk, he looks into the drawer and finds the key]

[LIVING ROOM - Dan is leaving]

  Serena
Hey, were are you going? I made us a study room.

  Dan
You know, I just gonna write my paper at home. I... I think Chuck is right.

  Serena
Chuck? No, don't listen to him.

  Dan
No, the guy has a point actually. Maybe the reason none of you take this seriously is because for you it's not.

  Serena
No, it is... just trust me, ok?

[Vanessa walks over with her camera]

  Dan
Vanessa, please, some space. I'm sorry.

  Vanessa
Sorry.

[Vanessa walks away]

  Dan
Look, I'm all for loyalty, I'm all for sticking together. But we are not in the same boat here. I'm on a partial scholarship, my parents have no way of buying my way back into this school or any other. And I know this is not going to be a popular opinion with... with your band of brothers but if the person who brought that key refuses to step up then anybody who knows anything has the right to say something. Do... do you know who it is?

[Serena doesn't say anything, she just looks at him]

  Dan
You do, don't you. You're not gonna say anything?

  Serena
Dan, please. You don't understand...

  Dan
You're right, I... I don't understand.

[Blair walks down the stairs, Chuck grabs her]

  Blair
Hey, let go of me, Bass!
Drop your Archibald habit first.

  Blair
You know I already have.

  Chuck
Really? A kiss does sort of send the wrong signal. Let's not waste time denying.

  Blair
You know what? I'm tired of this. Go ahead and tell him.

  Chuck
Really? You want me to tell him how you slept with me then faked your virginity for him.

  Blair
I'll just tell him you're lying. And who do you think he will believe? You who bangs everything in his field of vision or me, his pure and honest girlfriend of many years.

  Chuck
Oh no, he will believe me.

  Blair
Why?

  Chuck
I have proof.

[Chuck points towards Vanessa who was filming the whole conversation]

  Chuck
Good eye, docu-girl. I take the tape now.

  Blair
You knew she was watching? This is my house, the tape belongs to me.

  Vanessa
Actually, this is my footage and thanks to both of you I think I got a new angle on my subject.

[Dan walks over]

  Dan
Hey, Vanessa, let's get out of here.

[Chuck grabs Vanessa who fights him off]

  Chuck
If you think I'll just let you walk out of here with that tape you're crazy!

  Dan
Hey! Last time I checked I still owe you a black eye so unless this is you coming to claim it... stay away from her.

[Dan and Vanessa enter the elevator and leave]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Now that s*x and lies have been caught on videotape, V's documentary just became the most anticipated new release of the year.

[THE PALACE HOTEL - ROOM OF THE VAN DER WOODSENS - Somebody knocks, Lily opens the door]

  Lily
Rufus, what are you doing here?

  Rufus
I'm not leaving you a message from the courtyard this time.

  Lily
Well, I can see that but five minutes ago my kids would have to...

  Rufus
Why did you really come to see me yesterday?

  Lily
I told you out of respect for...

  Rufus
Respect or regret? You wanted me to give you a reason not to spend the rest of your life with Bart Bass.

  Lily
Rufus...

  Rufus
I'm still in love with you.

  Lily
So what exactly are you offering, Rufus? Some retrospective of the way we were over a decade ago? We're not twenty and on the road.

  Rufus
Thank god we're not! Because your mother made this decision for you back then, remember?

  Lily
Yes.

  Rufus
Look, I don't know exactly what it would mean for us to be together... but can you look at me and tell me you're not the least bit curious. You're at the same crossroads you were years ago. Claim you life this time. Live it the way you want to live it.

[Rufus kisses Lily and then leaves]

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - HEADMISTRESS'S OFFICE]

  Nate
I did it. I broke into the school.

  Miss Queller
After all your family has been through this year. I'm surprised to hear you're behind something like this.

  Nate
I know, I know. And I apologize.

[Headmistress Queller looks at Nate's school record]

  Miss Queller
From what I can see you always seem to be toing the line of mediocracy, Nathaniel. You're grades are average at best... almost as if you are not committed to school or your future.

  Nate
Could we just move on to the punishment part of this meeting, please.

  Miss Queller
Certainly. But I'm curious, can you please describe how you broke into the school?

  Nate
Even better, I can show you. [Nate pulls the key out of his pocket and puts it on the desk]

  Miss Queller
And how did you get access to this key? You're not on the swim team, not a janitor, right?

  Nate
No.

  Miss Queller
Where is the keychain?

  Nate
Keychain?

  Miss Queller
Do you remember its colour, size, what its made of... anything at all?

[She puts a photo of the key on the desk, attached to the key there is a long red keychain]

  Miss Queller
Who are you trying to protect?
EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - Vanessa sets up her video camera, Blair walks towards her]

  Blair
May I have a word... off camera?

  Vanessa
Eh, sure. But I think I know what you are gonna say and I can save you the indignity of graffling by telling you right now: No way you're gonna get that tape.

  Blair
I wasn't going to graffle and the fact that you even went there makes it clear that you have no idea who you're dealing with.

  Vanessa
What are you gonna do to me, Blair? Blackmail me for eating yoghurt on the Met's steps? You have nothing I need.

  Blair
You put that footage into your film you won't be able to show it. I won't sign a release.

  Vanessa
I'm not looking for a distribution deal... just a local art's grand so I can pay my rent. Now if you excuse me... you're in my shot.

[Blair walks off, Chuck taps Vanessa on the shoulder and she turns around, he holds a bundle of dollar bills up]

  Vanessa
What's that? Your stripper money?

  Chuck
Ten thousand dollars for the tape.

  Vanessa
You think I'll take your money?

  Chuck
Yes, I do. I know girls like you. You act like money is not important... the truth is money is important to everyone.

  Vanessa
And I thought Blair was manipulative.

  Chuck
Blair is an amateur. She thinks you're just like her. To Blair, this means a couple pairs of Manolo's and a Chanel bag but I know that this much cash could make a real difference in your life.

[Vanessa pulls the tape out of the camera and exchanges it for the money]

  Vanessa
You're sick.

  Chuck
You're welcome.

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Who knew B and C were such patrons of the arts? Call it philanthropy or bribery... it looks like everyone has their price.

[INT RESTAURANT - Bart and Lily are sitting together]

  Bart
Something on your mind, Lily?

  Lily
Ah...

[Bart's phone rings and he answers it]

  Bart
Yeah... what do you say? Excuse me, it's Sheldon, he has those numbers I asked him for. Would you mind...

  Lily
No.

  Bart
Yeah, just make sure he gets it at the current rate. The dollar has been all over the place.

[Bart leaves the table, Lily looks around the restaurant and then calls Rufus]

[INT THE HUMPHREY'S ART GALLERY - Rufus picks up the phone]

  Rufus
Hello?

[INT RESTAURANT]

  Lily
I was thinking about what you said... let's do it. Let's see what we are, let's see what we could be.

[INT THE HUMPHREY'S ART GALLERY]

  Rufus
Who is this?

[INT RESTAURANT]

  Lily
Rufus...

[INT THE HUMPHREY'S ART GALLERY]

  Rufus
Lily, this is great! Do you know how great this is?

[INT RESTAURANT]

  Lily
Well, yes... I mean I do, I mean I think so...

[INT THE HUMPHREY'S ART GALLERY]

  Rufus
Let's go away tonight. Let's pack a bag... let's get away from everyone, everything... just figure it out.

[INT RESTAURANT]

  Lily
Where would we go?

  Rufus
Who cares!

  Lily
Uh, ok, sound like a plan. Ehm, 90 and 5th, six o'clock.

  Rufus
Ok.

  Lily
I'm scared, Rufus. In a good way.

  Rufus
Me too.

[Lily hangs up the phone and smiles]
INT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - The students are assembled]

  Miss Queller
Settle down please.

[Chuck leans over to Blair and starts whispering]

  Chuck
Proof... worth every penny.

  Miss Queller
Yesterday I talked about serious consequences for your dishonerable action and obviously you didn't believe me. But someone came forward today and claimed responsibility...

[Serena whispers to Blair]

  Serena
Do you know who?

  Miss Queller
... for a crime he did not commit. And although I appreciate his self-sacrifice, I don't aby dishonesty. And I think it's time you all know how serious I am. Nathaniel Archibald is suspended from St. Jude's. And yes, this will go on his transcript. Effective immediatelly. Mr. Archibald, you know where to find the exit.

[Nate gets up and leaves the room, the other students look after him, Dan looks especially worried]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)

  This just in
Nate Archibald - Dead man walking. We hear St. Jude's has a new policy: An eye for a lie.

  Miss Queller
Watch him go, students. Who wants to be next? Until one of you comes forward, we'll keep going until every last one of you has walked out that door.

[EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - Dan exits the school and walks towards Serena]

  Dan
I don't believe this.

  Serena
Dan, it's ok.

  Dan
Serena, I can't... I can't get expelled. I cannot get suspended. My whole future is riding on this. If you know who broke in, why don't you give him up?

  Serena
Because it was me.

[Dan and Serena sit down at a table in the courtyard]

  Dan
So, why didn't you tell me right away?

  Serena
Because I didn't want you to judge me.

  Dan
Aren't we already beyond that?

  Serena
and I didn't want you to know... because I didn't want you to be in the position you're now. Of having to choose between helping me and helping yourself.

  Dan
So, how did you even get in?

  Serena
I have a key.

  Dan
You have a key to the pool?

  Serena
What happend to being beyond this?

  Dan
Sorry.

  Serena
The end of freshman year I... kind of dated the swim team captain and he gave me a key so that we could... you know... meet up... and...

  Dan
Enough said. Saturday night, what happend then?

  Serena
Well, Blair and I ran out of places to go and she knew I still had a key and... before I knew it, it's like we are all there. And I thought it would be just us girls and then everybody got on their phone and more people started showing up and... I just never thought anybody was gonna get hurt.

  Dan
Yeah. Well, you can still tell Queller the truth. I think she will respect your honesty.

  Serena
Yeah, like she respected Nate's.

  Dan
No, Nate lied... and besides, you're Serena van der Woodsen.

  Serena
You didn't know me before I went away. I barely got back into Constance. If I got expelled I don't think any school in town would take me.

  Dan
I'm sure that's not true.

  Serena
I can't risk going back to bording school... being away from you and Erik. But I don't want you to loose your future.

  Dan
Wow. You really can be damned if you do and screwed if you don't.
Announcement
Dan Humphrey, Headmistress Queller is requesting to see you in her office after class.

[Blair meets Nate outside the school]

  Blair
Nate, are you ok?

  Nate
I'll be fine. My parents have so much other stuff going on right now... they'll get over it. Either way it was worth it.

  Blair
Worth it?

  Nate
Yeah, Blair, I know how much your future means to you. You worked so hard for Yale and everything...

  Blair
What are you talking about?

  Nate
You don't have to lie. I saw the key in your bedroom.

  Blair
That key isn't mine. I'm just hiding it for someone else. Wait... that's why you were suspended? You told the headmistress it was yours because you thought it was mine? That's the most romantic thing anyone has ever done for me.

  Nate
I love you.

[Nate leans in to kiss her but Blair moves away]

  Blair
Please, you and I just can't happen right now.

  Nate
Why not?

  Blair
I don't want to be with you.

  Nate
Good catching up.

[Nate walks away, Blair looks after him]

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - LILY'S ROOM - Lily is packing some clothes, Serena walks in and lets herself fall face down onto the bed]

  Lily
You're home early. Please don't tell me you're expelled.

  Serena
I'm not.

  Lily
Your position at that school is already too precarious... one false move and you know what? I can't do anything to help you.

  Serena
I know, I know. I just want to hide under the covers and make it all go away... [Serena notices that her mother is packing]

  Serena
... and apperently you do too. You and Bart just got back, why are you packing again?

  Lily
Well, I was just gonna go for a... you know... a little spa trip for the weekend.

  Serena
Because you're so stressed out from your vacation?

[Lily's phone rings, Serena picks it up: 'Rufus calling', she hands it to her mother, Lily declines the call and puts the phone away]

  Serena
Aren't you gonna answer that?

  Lily
No, I don't think so.

  Serena
Mom, is Dan's dad the reason you haven't answered Bart's proposal?
[Lily doesn't answer, Serena gets out of bed and faces her mother] Serena
You can't. Please mom, not this one.

  Lily
Look, I will not base my personal life on your preferences.

  Serena
Dan is my boyfriend... and I know we're too young to talk about forever but right now that's what it feels like.

  Lily
I know it does, sweety, but...

  Serena
But what? Tell me that Rufus is that important to you. Tell me that whatever the two of you have is the most important thing in your life. Beause that's what Dan is to me, mom... the most important. I'd be rather be Chuck's stepsister than Dan's. Please don't do this to me.

  Lily
Dan means that much to you.

  Serena
Yeah, he does. In fact, I have to go.

  Lily
Wait, wait, where?

  Serena
School. There's something I have to do. And I hope there is something you have to do too.

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Vanessa enters]

  Blair
What are you doing here?

  Vanessa
I brought this for you.

[Vanessa shows her the tape]

  Blair
What's the catch?

  Vanessa
I know this might come as a shock but not everyone operates from an agenda. In fact, some people do things simply because they're the decent things to do. Smash it, burn it, whatever. There are no copies.

[She hands the tape to Blair]

  Blair
What about the one you gave to Chuck?

  Vanessa
It's blank which I'm sure he will be thrilled to discover. And about what's on that tape... having you observed you in your natural habitat these past few days... Nate seems like on of the good guys and you seem to really care about him.

[INT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE - HEADMISTRESS QUELLER'S OFFICE]

  Miss Queller
Mr. Humphrey you have a partial scholarship at St. Jude's. You are number two in your class, have a stellar recommendation for Dartmouth from J.L. Hall. It looks as if your dreams are well within your grasp.

  Dan
Thank you, I guess they are.

  Miss Queller
But it seems you're in with a new crowd this year, dating Serena van der Woodsen.

  Dan
Is that in my file?

  Miss Queller
Who had the key to the school?

  Dan
I don't know. Miss Queller
Let me remind you one last time that you are in a different position than the others... you need this school.

[There's a knock on the door, Serena enters]

  Serena
Headmistress Queller, I have something to tell you.

[Serena sits down next to Dan]

  Miss Queller
I must say your file reads more like a rep sheet: You cut more sophomore classes than you attended, cheated on tests, talked back to teachers.

  Serena
I understand that this is a serious matter. That's why it's important to me that you know, you being new here, that the person you just described is not who I am anymore.

  Miss Queller
Oh no? Who are you now?

  Serena
Well, my grades are up, my attendance is nearly perfect and I've stayed out of trouble.

  Miss Queller
Until now.

  Serena
Please understand, I never intended for anything bad to happen. And it may have taken some time but I am here now, accepting responsebility for my actions. Whatever you think is fair.

  Miss Queller
Yes, let's discuss the... consequences.

[INT COFFEE SHOP - Blair enters]

  Blair
I'll be brief.

  Vanessa
I'll be not interested.

  Blair
Is that how you speak to the person who just paid your rent for a year.

  Vanessa
What did you just say?

  Blair
Congratulations, Vanessa, you just won 365 more days in your Ikea furnished closet.

  Blair
You went to my building? You talked to my landlord?

  Blair
No, I don't speak Ukranian but I do speak envelope of cash. And he understood me perfectly.

  Vanessa
I can't believe you.

  Blair
Blair Waldorf is not indepted to anyone. No matter how much I appreciate what you did.

  Vanessa
You're welcome, I guess.

  Blair
Good! Now this transaction is finished and I'm free to return to disliking you.

  Vanessa
I wouldn't have it any other way.

  Blair
Oh, and one more thing... if you didn't pay your rent with it, what did you do with Chuck's money.

  Vanessa
I may have created a medical grand for teens with genital herpes... in his name.

[EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD AND ST. JUDE]

  Serena
I can't believe she didn't expell me.

  Dan
Yeah, I know, it's shocking.

  Serena
I... 25 hours of community outreach... that's not bad at all. I probably would have done it anyway since I am on the commitee.

  Dan
That had occurred to me, yeah.

  Serena
Wait, what are you saying?

  Dan
No, I'm not saying anything, believe me.

  Serena
So, you don't buy what she said about me being the poster child for the new honour code. Look, I know for a fact my mom didn't plea in my case or donate anythink, ok?

  Dan
I didn't say a thing.

  Serena
Are you really turning this into an upstairSerena
downstairs thing?

  Dan
No, no, you are. I'm being completely silent. I'm just happy you're not being expelled or leaving town anytime soon. Are you hungry? We shoud...

  Serena
Always... but you still believe there's a double standard. That people like me get special treatment...
Chauffeur
Miss van der Woodsen? You're mother send me to pick you up.

  Serena
Oh, great. That was... thoughtfull.

  Dan
I think you get no special treatment at all. Your life is completely uncharmed and average.

  Serena
It's ok, I walk.

[Serena walks off]

  Dan
No, come on, I was kidding, I was kidding.

[Dan turns to the chauffeur]

  Dan
You're going to Brooklyn?

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - ROOM OF THE VAN DER WOODSENS - Bart, Chuck, Lily, Serena and Erik stand together, champagne in hand]

  Bart
It's a rare occasion to celebrate the merging of two families and I couldn't be happier to be here tonight to celebrate Lily's acceptance of my proposal.

[FLASHBACK - EXT STREETS OF NEW YORK - Lily walks up to Rufus]

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - They toast]

  Bart
So, to my lovely bride and our growing family.

[FLASHBACK - EXT STREETS OF NEW YORK]

  Rufus
You packed light.

  Lily
Please try to understand.

  Rufus
I think I do. I'm just sorry.

  Lily
So am I.

[Rufus walks to his car, Lily watches him drive away]

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL]

  Erik
Mom looks about as happy as grandma at last call.

  Serena
I know. Seems Bart's personality or lack thereof is contagious. I don't even know how she breathes with her blouse button that high.

[Chuck walks over and hugs Serena]

  Chuck
How glad are you to see our families merge, sis?

  Serena
So glad that if you ever call me that again it will be the last thing you ever say, Chuck.

  Chuck
I love it. Our first brother-sister squabble. I hope you're going to make yourself available for more missed childhood memories... bathing together for example.

[Serena turns her back to Chuck who takes the opportunity to look at her buttom]

[INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - BLAIR'S ROOM]

  Blair
You're probably wondering why I asked you here.

  Nate
After our last conversation, yeah.

  Blair
Do you think it's possible for two people who've been through as much as we have to really... forgive and forget?

  Nate
If we really want to I think we can.

  Blair
A lot of mistakes have been made.

  Nate
If you're ready to forgive me then nothing can tear us apart, I promise.

  Blair
What you said before... I love you too. Always have, always will.

[She kisses him]

[INT THE PALACE HOTEL - ROOM OF THE VAN DER WOODSENS - Bart joins Serena on the couch]

  Bart
So, your new stepbrother told me about your problem at school. Frankly, I wasn't surprised given your propensity for recklessness and adventure.

  Serena
I'm sorry?

  Bart
Don't tell your mother but I made a call.

  Serena
You did what?

  Bart
It was harder than usual. That new headmistress of yours is a real piece of work. I had to go over her head. Sorry I couldn't get the charges completely dropped but at least I got you minimal sentence.

[Serena moves a little futher away from Bart]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
One thing about being on the inside: Once you get there you don't always get to choose where you stand... or sit.

[Chuck sits down to the other side of Serena]

  Chuck
I was just looking out for my family. The new van der Woodsen/Bass liberary should be completed for Erik's graduation.

  Bart
I can see that Lily and I are gonna have our hands full with the two of you.

  Serena
Excuse me, I need some air.

[Serena gets up and leaves apruptly the suite]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
Sometimes you need to step outside, clear your head and remind yourself of who you are.

[INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - Rufus is putting some sheet music and photos into a box, Serena enters]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
And where you want to be.

  Serena
Hey.

  Rufus
Aren't you supposed to be at your mom's engagement thing?

  Serena
Yeah, I had to get out of there. It was getting a little hard to breathe, you know.

  Rufus
Those parties can be that way.

  Serena
So, are you packing up your music?

  Rufus
No, I just... need to find something new to right about. And I will.

[DAN'S ROOM - Dan is studying on his bed, Serena enters]

  Dan
Hey, you're a little overdressed for the study date I didn't know we had.

  Serena
You were right about everything.

  Dan
Wanna talk about it?

  Serena
Can I just sit with you here for a while?

  Dan
Yeah.

[Serena picks up a book]

  Serena
Chalcer?

  Dan
Yeah, I got a test on Friday.

  Serena
Mine's Thursday.

[They get comfortable on the bed and start studying]

  Gossip Girl (Voice Over)
And sometimes you have to venture outside your world in order to find yourself. As for me, I'm happy right where I am... I only want to be with you. XOXO Gossip Girl.

      END OF EPISODE



Gossip girl here.
Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.

" What's the difference between gossip and scandal? So glad you asked, ues forever.
Anyone can commit a minor indiscretion And generate a day's worth of buzz, But in order for gossip to birth a true scandal, It requires the right person to be in the wrong place.
Take one "it" girl on a pedestal.
Which one do you recommend? Add a crowd eager to see her fall And give them the means to knock her down.
I can't believe this.
oh, my god.
Dan! What? what? what? you okay? no.
I'fine.
euh, I was just testing my screaming To see its screaming efficiency.

Jenny, would you excuse us? Is there something you want to tell me? Am I that obvious? yes, actually.
That hair color is all wrong for you.
That's funny.
This isn't.
Please say something.
A-anything would be better than this "i am so disappointed in you" silence.
Since the time you could walk, Your mother and i-- we knew you were special.
You were very art, very talented, And we promised each other we would do whatever it took To give you a bright future, And that did not include you becoming a teenage father.
Dad, this wasn't seriously, not a part of the plan, But whatever serena decides to do, I-i-i want to be there for her.
I-i have to be there for her.
I love her.
Dan I do.
I do, whether she's pregnant, whether she's not pregnant I-i love her.
First things first.
I think you need to talk to her.
Maybe it's not even true.

Hey, mom.
Yes, I'm pregnant, and it's yours.

Um, thank you, though.

yeah, yeah, Well, hey, that's good news-- the no baby part.
It's really good news, like my-dad's-probably-gonna- Throw-a-party-good news.

Her new line was fabulous.
Hi! Jenny, hi.
you're late.
Yeah, I know.
I had to drop some books off at the library.
sorry.
Would you do me a favor? anything.
Move down a couple steps.
You know, this whole hazing thing is getting a bit old, Don't you think, b.
? first of all, the hazing stops when I say it stops.
And for future reference, only my friends call me "b.

close call, huh? Are we really gonna play that old game, b.
? I have no idea what you're talking about.
Whenever something happens that's not a part of your plan, You pretend like it doesn't exist.
You act like you're in this movie about your perfect life, Then I have to remind you, The only one watching that movie is you.
You admitted that your period was late.
yes, I've been very stressed.
And you're acting like a total bitch Because you're not hormonal? maybe I am a total bitch.
Just take the test, b.
Stop it.
Just take the test.
You need to know if you and chuck are gonna have a baby.
And for a scandal to really blow up, All it needs is an unexpected turn.
Would you do me a really big favor? What is it, sweetie? I need you to come with me to visit my dad in rehab.
Please.
Really? Yeah, it's just-- It gets really awaward when I have to go alone now, And I don't know what to say anymore.
He loves you.
you always know how to make him laugh.
Nathaniel archibald, You have never asked me for anything, And here you are, officially leaning on me.
This time we're gonna be so much better together.
We already are.
Well, at least now you know.
know what? that I've wasted half the year Trying to be friends with someone That's never going to like me? uh, yeah.
that's exactly it.
Hey.
guys.
so Dad.
You're not gonna be a grandfather.
That's cool.
That's really cool.
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes! Yes.
And I thought I was relieved.
it's not all good news, though.
I-i told her I love her, and she thinks I only said that Because I thought she was pregnant.
well, son, Gives you a minute to step back and enjoy being 17.
You two were moving a bit too fast anyway.
I'm late for the gallery, but we can talk more later.
Wow.
I've never seen you give up so easily.
Can you not start with me? can you not be so easy to start with? Why are you taking his advice? he's old and alone.
what? Tell serena again without the pregnancy scare, In a quiet, no distractions kind of way.
But then again, what do I know about romance, Friends or anything else? no, no, no, no, no.
Actually, jen, that's-- that's a very good idea.
Oh, right.
What would you do without me? Promise me I will find out one day.
Hey, b.
What are you doing here? in the neighborhood.
Can we talk later? despite your best efforts to ruin it, I'm actually having a good day, and I don't want anything To spoil it.
guess who asked me to visit the captain with him? Yes.
it's like he finally needs me and isn't afraid to-- look, b.
, To burst your happy bubble, but I'm not giving up.
well, I'm sorry, I haven't been on the pill since I was 15.
okay, I am giving up.
Before you start planning your perfect night with nate, Don't you think you should-- I'm not pregnant, serena.
What's wrong? was it something I cooked? No.
no, no, no.
I'm sorry.
It's honestly the best spaghetti I've ever tasted.
Thank you, even if I did have to drag it out of you myself.
Hey, guys.
Hey, jenny.
Go back to your room, jenny.
I'm just getting juice.
Excuse me.
Hey, jen.
could you do me a favor And drink your juice at vanessa's, maybe? I'm going back to my room, closing the door, Putting on my headphones and ignoring you and your date.
excellent.
Where were we? Um Well, let--let's try this.
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind? Then it can be on our minds, And our minds can worry about what's on your mind, together.
I have no idea what you just said.
I don't know what I said either, but, um, What I'm saying now is talk to me.
I never thought I was pregnant.
The test was for blair.
oh, wait, wait.
I'm confused.
She just got back together with nate.
So oh.
then who? Chuck.
Chuck? And blair? Blair and chuck? Then why isn't he the one buying the test? because Because he's an ass.
who doesn't know.
Why not? I mean, there's no love lost between me and chuck bass, But I gotta believe he--he deserves to know.
He--he does have this weird influence over her.
Maybe he could talk her into taking the test.
I just-- I'm so worried about her.
Come here.
This may be the most amazing purchase you'll ever make In your entire lovely existence.
your day almost over? Not quite.
I've got a few canvases to wrap And a little more paperwork.
I'm trying to get you to ask me out for after-work drinks.
Oh, oh.
uh, okay.
I'm sorry I didn't realize, I guess you're not done for the day after all, But when you are, call me.
Hi, rufus.
remember me? Bex, right? art dealer.
Yeah, you bought a very special piece For lily van der woodsen.
I'm looking for some things for a couple other clients.
Any new discoveries since the last time I was here? a few.
There's a beautiful mixed media piece on this wall over here.
As I recall, you had a wife in hudson.
That still true? Uh, she's still there.
I'm still here.
Made things a little difficult.
Still trying? I'm trying to move on.
Hmm.
tomorrow night too soon to start? I suppose not.
Sounds good.
Okay.
Hi, chuck.
Please, call me "brother.
" I need to talk to you.
About getting knocked up? I must say I was a little disappointed you weren't more careful.
Chuck, I really need to trust you.
I'm hoping that deep down inside, You're actually a decent person And won't make me regret this.
You're here for blair, aren't you? Look, I'm not going to tell nate about us.
I tortured her, got bored and moved on.
There's no moving on just yet.
The pregnancy test wasn't for me.
it was for blair.
What? she won't take it.
So given that if she's pregnant, you're the-- no, we used a condom.
Well, obviously, it broke.
what is obvious Is that your best friend has kept you in the dark.
What are you talking about? like I said, I handle my business.
apparently, nate doesn't.
They slept together just after we did.
It's him you should be asking for help.
Hey, dad.
I need to talk to to you about something.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
it's a little early in the morning For the teens-gone-wild contingency plan, isn't it? It's not about your relationship with serena.
oh.
oh, then what? I need to know how you and jenny would feel If I went out tonight for a drink with a woman.
Well, I guess I feel like you shouldn't wear that shirt, Or there will not be a second date.
Really? r-really.
Thanks.
Now I guess I just have to worry about jenny then.
Good morning.
hi.
Good morning, sunshine.
Dad, where'd you get that shirt? What's wrong with this shirt? nothing, As long as you don't plan to wear it out of the house.
It's worse.
he plans on wearing it on a date.
For drinks, if that's okay.
whatever.
it's awful.
Guess you have your answer.
answer to what? Nothing.
nothing.
Morning.
Good morning, miss serena.
Anybody notice the weather today? what? Take a look outside, b.
my first response Would be that the sky is a clear blue easy.
Dorota, you may be excused now.
I can't believe you didn't tell me about you and nate.
What did he say? noing.
chuck did, when I went to see him Because I thought maybe he could talk some sense into you.
You had no right to do that.
I was trying to help you, b.
Let another rumor about me run rampant.
The whole school heard, even dan.
What's going on? Ask blair.
her version of the story's always better.
Fine.
You all right? Never been better.
Well, serena has.
what's wrong? I don't know.
I can't be held responsible for her mood swings.
Were you arguing About the possibility That your condition may have returned? No.
and it hasn't.
I heard you The other day, In your bathroom, with the water running.
I'm very stressed.
And with you and serena down my throat, I can hardly think straight, never mind keep food down.
Maybe you do just need to take a little bak, , h? Visit your father? lyon is beautiful this time of year.
maybe this summer.
Summer sounds great.
finish your breakfast.
I'm not pregnant.
I command myself not to be pregnant.
Hello? hey, s.
it's b.
Two things.
First I'm sorry About dan, about the "gossip girl" blast And about not telling you about nate.
okay.
You were just so hard on me about chuck.
I didn't want to be judged for sleeping with them both.
I understand.
apology accepted.
That was fast.
if I were you, I would've made me work for it a little bit harder.
Well, I think you've suffered enough.
and second thing-- Wait.
that's already, like, three things.
I took the test.
Aah! oh, my gosh! are you kidding me? Aah! Oh, I am so happy.
I would have had no idea what to wear to a paternity hearing.
clean slate? Oh, clean slate.
oh, I'm so happy.
See you at school.
Oh, don't stop on my account.
oh, I have to.
Secondhand smoke is bad for the, uh I'm not pregnant, so good-bye, Mistake so far in my past I can hardly remember.
You cannot be serious.
you can't be touching me.
Look, if you were gonna tell nate, You would have done so in monaco, But you don't want him to hate you, and you know he would.
Game over.
game's not over until I say it is.
Then have fun playing with yourself.
Got 'em.
Are--are--are you cold? I'm okay.
It's pretty cold.
here, let me get you this blanket.
This will be better to keep you warm.
Um, you--you want some ginger ale? Here.
I brought this for us.
We can have a nice little drink.
Um, it might be a little cold, actually.
I--you okay? you're doing that, um thing.
Yeah, i-i know.
I'm sorry.
i It's just i-i don't know.
In--in the short time we've known each other, You--you've become really important to me.
I've been struggling to find a way to tell you, Struggling now.
Oh, my lit paper.
no, no, no, no, no.
Oh! no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, my gosh.
here you go.
I love you.
thank you.
No problem.
all right, take care.
That was a close call.
I'm sorry.
that would've completely ruined our picnic.
Yeah.
Okay, what, um, what was it you were saying? Oh, just I think I should proofread this for you.
can i? Sure.
yeah, but can we eat first? 'cause I'm starving.
Yeah.
let's eat.
Can you believe this? Jenny, come look at this.
Looks like the virgin queen Isn't as pure as she pretended to be.
Who's your daddy, b.
? baby daddy, that is.
Two guys in one week? talk about doing the nasty, Or should I just say being nasty? Oh, my god.
you know she's right about this.
Oh, god, there she is.
what a total hypocrite.
Who does she think she is? Pot calling the kettle black much? Oh, I can see a bump! what a bitch.
Oh, my god, she is such a whore.
She cheated on nate?! does nate know? Oh, god! Have you seen nate? No.
I saw it.
Yeah, blair's gonna freak out.
I mean, this is a total lie.
Yeah.
Of course it is.
Jenny, look, I know you're friends with blair, And you'd never want to do anything to betray her, But if you know something well, blair was never really my friend.
So So Yeah, there's something you should know.
I don't know if you would want to her Whoa, man! Did you sleep with her, huh? You son of a bitch.
I could kill you.
What'd you do? did you get what you wanted, Like you do with all those other girls? yes, nathaniel.
I took what blair Kept throwing at you and you kept throwing back.
Oh, so somehow you screwing blair for sport is my fault? It wasn't for sport.
she needed someone, and I was there.
Oh, so you cared about her? You guys were broken up.
what, for how long? a week? an hour? Look, I am sorry, all right? I know how long you and I have been best friends, okay? No, it's not okay, chuck.
From now on, you stay away from me.
nate.
Did you hear what I said? You stay the hell away from me, chuck! Show's over.
What are you doing here? your mom let me in.
I didn't ask how you got in.
I asked why you came.
To talk.
about us.
There's no "us," blair.
Yes, there is.
we finally really have a chance to start over.
You know, all this time, I felt so b for everything I've done, And when you said you wanted to leave the past in the past, I didn't know we were talking about your past.
I made a decision I was in no condition to make.
Yes.
then you'll understand perfectly when I say I want nothing else to do with you, blair.
You and chuck deserve each other.
you know chuck would say anything, But jenny wouldn't.
jenny? And don't go blaming any of this on her, blair.
I would have found out eventually.
I said I'm done.
It's over.
now would you please leave? Fine.
stay as long as you like.
I'll leave.
Bryn.
hi.
Good to see you again.
Rufus, at the risk of being forward, I'm here on a dare from my friends to ask you out.
Then I guess I have to say, uh Yes? yes, you do.
Well, tonight, I have plans, but maybe some other night Am I interrupting? Hi.
Uh, bryn, bex.
bex, bryn.
Actually, I'm bex.
she must be bryn.
I always get a little tongue-tied with my b's.
Looks like you're still tied up.
Maybe we should reschedule drinks.
no, that-- that won't be necessary.
Actually, I think it will.
good to meet you, bryn.
you, too.
bye.
Guess you're available after all.
Hey, b.
what's up? I can't believe you told jenny about me and chuck.
What? i-i didn't.
Because of her, everybody knows the intimate details Of my private life, and now nate's not speaking to me.
but i-i told you, I didn't tell jenny.
I don't know how she found out.
did you tell dan? What? You did.
you told your low-rent boyfriend, And he told his social-climbing sister Who wears my hand-me-downs, and she blabbed to nate.
I can't believe you're attacking dan and jenny.
Did you or did you not tell him? I did, But only because you weren't dealing with it, And I wanted advice on how to help you.
I can't believe you don't get it.
The rules are different For the serena van der woodsens of the world.
People expect you to party and be wild, Sleep with whoever you want, run away, come back.
wait, You shot your reputation to hell a long time ago.
It doesn't matter what you do, but I'm a waldorf.
well, Obviously don't need me and my low-rent taste, You and the waldorf name can weather the storm alone.
With pleasure.
Hey, jenny.
Hi.
Are you joining us? um What are you doing here? I was just leaving.
No, stay.
Blair, given you can barely manage your own messy affairs, Surely you're not in a position to tell anyone Where they can and can't eat.
do you realize who you're talking to? You mean a self-righteous bitch who always sat On her own high horse judging everyone else? pregnant little hypocrite.
Not that it's any of your business, But I'm not pregnant.
Nate must be thrilled.
chuck, too.
What are you talking about? The whole school saw them throwing down Over your cheap ass.
The boyfriend and the best friend? pretty classy.
Consider yourself dethroned, Queen b.
Nn jey.
consider yourself dethroned, It is highly unlikely That I will ever forgive you for going to nate, But if you walk away from me now, I will also ruin you.
How are you gonna do that? Good to see you again.
Okay.
bye.
take care.
enjoy.
Hi.
it's bex.
you know what to do.
Hi.
it's rufus, Calling again to apologize about last night again.
I really didn't mean to insult you or disrespect you Or whatever it is I did.
I'm new at this, and well I'm new at this.
You told jenny about blair and chuck? No.
no, of course not.
Well, you're the only one I told.
And I didn't tell anybody.
How can I know that? Because I gave you my word.
Because I love you.
What? I love you, And not just because I thought you were pregnant And not in the way you love Some random guy who picks up your lit paper Or some girl who likes your hair.
Okay.
"okay"? That response is not okay.
I'm such an ass.
let me guess.
dan? He told me loved me, And all I did was stand there like a stupid mute.
I mean, why wouldn't I want to hear those words Come out of his mouth? but it's like it made me trust him less, Which is crazy, and even if he is lying about telling jenny, Even though I told him not to tell anyone, I should have come up with a better response to "i love you.
But why would you think he was lying? because I'm the only one who knew, And he's the only one I told.
On your conversations when you thought I wasn't? ooh.
none, I hope.
You hope wrong.
I'm a little brother.
It's what I do, and you don't have to be a genius To figure out the trust thing.
I mean, every time Mom brought home someone who said, "i love you," They would end up married.
and then divorced.
Didn't leave us with a strong sense of trust, huh? But that's mom's issue, not ours, And dan's not one of those guys.
Okay, this conversation has to end, Because you're getting dangerously close To being smarter than I am, No, thank you.
all right.
I came to congratulate you in person.
You ruined my relationship with nate, Serena, all of my friends.
Even little jenny thinks she's too good for me, So bravo.
Just like you wanted.
I have no one to turn to but you.
Actually, you don't even have me.
Enough.
I'll try to be more succinct.
You held a certain fascination When you were beautiful, Delicate And untouched.
But now you're like One of the arabians my father used to own-- Rode hard and put away wet.
I don't want you anymore, And I can't see why anyone else would.
You okay? I'd be a lot better if I could spend a semester Going to school in france.
A semester? Well, i-i already talked to harold about a visit, And he was-- he was thrilled.
So can I go? Now? Mom, please try.
Blair, I am very concerned.
So book a flight.
We'll get you out tomorrow.
Thank you.
Who's up for a barneys drive-by? Me.
ooh.
followed by hot sake at decibel.
Huh.
I don't think so.
yeah.
she made out with the bartender last time.
Now he thinks she loves him.
what about you, little j.
? Oh, I can't.
I have to return these books to the library.
Elise will take them for you, Won't you, e.
? Yeah, sure.
It's okay.
I can do it.
The question isn't if you can do it, jenny, It's if you should have to.
I'm going there anyway.
Okay.
Let me know if you need anything else.
You coming? Props to blair.
she trained you well.
Hi.
Hi.
Don't act so surprised to see me.
How could I not stop by After all those pitiful messages you left? oh, for the record, I'm really sorry for what happened the other night.
so am i.
Look, bex, I was married for almost 20 years, And before that, I was a somewhat successful musician, And I wouldn't really call what I was doing dating.
what was it then? A succession of women-- Groupies, mostly-- whose chose me.
I really don't have any experience With real honest-to-goodness dating.
Despite your worst efforts, I am completely charmed by you, rufus humphrey.
Thanks, I think.
Okay.
Here's where we are.
Dating 101, lesson 1.
In two days, you're gonna call me And thank me for forgiving you of your dating faux pas.
You'll ask me out to dinner-- someplace elegant But intimate, and we are going to have a fabulous time.
You got all that? absolutely.
Good.
talk to you in two days.
two days.
Okay.
Hello? I never was good at following rules.
Hey.
what are you doing here? I need to know why you love me.
Because I do.
I really want to trust you when you say those words, dan, So maybe if I knew why, I'd stop being so scared of hearing them And afraid to say them.
Okay.
Well, if you want to talk about why-- It has to do with my mom and her many marriages.
There.
that's why.
Because I actually like it when you interrupt me, Which is often, by the way.
I love you because you make no apologies About being exactly who you are-- Beautiful, smart, Sexy as hell-- Now you're embarrassing me.
That's another reason.
You're completely unaware of your affect on me.
You're also completely unaware That you laugh like a 4 year old.
Just like that.
And I love you because you can be with someone like me And still be best friends with someone like blair.
Yeah, well, I tried to be.
I know you do, and that's not easy, But you never give up on her.
That is how amazing you are.
Well, you're amazing, too, For being able to say all of those things, You just are.
And I love you But I have to go.
What? what--what is it this time? One of the many reasons you love me.
Blair.
What? You want a lift to j.
f.
k.
? Your mom said you were going to france tonight.
She has a big mouth.
b.
, I'm your best friend.
She was shocked I didn't know.
Well, now you do.
What I know is how you felt when I left without telling you.
Is there a reason you're here? Stay.
Don't let some stupid scandal make you run away Like it did me, like it does everyone in our world.
Everything's horrible.
My whole life is falling apart.
So rebuild it.
You're a waldorf, remember? People don't tell you who you are.
you tell them.
Stay and fight.
I'll fight with you.
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm so So what? Start over.
It can be done.
I should know.
We'll get through this together.
Promise? Promise.
Stop, guys.
I'm going home.
One good scandal deserves another.
Wonder who's going down next? Everybody, if b.
has anything to say about it.
You know you love me, X.

ACT ONE

["Do The Panic" by Phantom Planet plays over S, B, Chuck and Lonelyboy studying worriedly.]

  Gossip Girl
"There are three things we do alone: We are born, we die, and if we're a high school junior headed for college, we take the SAT. And while the test is said to measure our best traits, preparing for it Inevitably brings out the worst..."

[Lonelyboy, at home.]

  Gossip Girl
"Humility becomes self-doubt..."

[B yelling the answers while Dorota shows her stationary-quality flashcards.]

  Gossip Girl
"Striving becomes obsession..."

[S gulps coffee in a pile of books on her bed.]

  Gossip Girl
"Some are driven to self-medication..."

[Hazel, Isabel and Penelope gather seriously around a table.]

  Gossip Girl
"While others cling to the security of being part of a group."

[They hit a chess timer and start practice tests.]

[Chuck pays off a guy in the courtyard for something.]

  Gossip Girl
"And anyone who's used to bending the rules will find themselves breaking them."

[Lonelyboy's studying in his bedroom; Rufus enters suddenly.]

  Dan
Augh! Dad, don't ever do that again.

  Rufus
Just doing what I was told. Time's up. I was instructed that whenever time was up, I should share that information.

  Dan
Yes, but the manner in which you went about it, it was like you were deliberately trying to humiliate me.

  Rufus
...How bad?

  Dan
Uh, half. I finished exactly half in the allowed time.

  Rufus
Well, you're a smart kid.

  Dan
I'm a choker, I choke.

  Rufus
Just in your head.

  Dan
T-ball. First grade, remember this? Bases loaded, and I struck out.

  Rufus
You were six.

  Dan
The ball was on a tee, not moving.

  Rufus
You'll come through.

  Dan
You're basing that on what, exactly?

  Rufus
Blind faith?

[Jenny heads for the front door.]

  Jenny
Bye!

  Rufus
Wait.

  Jenny
Dad, I'm gonna be late.

  Rufus
I'm coming with you.

  Jenny
What? You're walking me to school?

  Rufus
Need the exercise.

  Jenny
I made one mistake. It doesn't mean I need A human ankle monitor.

  Rufus
You used to beg me to walk you to school. You'd cry if I didn't walk you to class.

  Jenny
That wasn't me. That was Dan.

  Dan
It's true, but I was six. And it an emotional time for me. It was post-t-ball.

  Rufus
Jenny, what you did was wrong and really out of character. Grounding you is not just about punishment, we need to spend some time together. Reconnect.

  Jenny
Yeah, I want that too, just... Not in public, and in front of my friends.

  Rufus
All right. Tonight, dinner.

  Jenny
Okay, and I have group rehearsal. I'm the alto.

  Rufus
And I'm really proud, but we are connecting this evening over lasagna.

  Dan
Hey, Jen, you wanna wait up for a second? We could take the...

[She slams the door behind her.]

  Dan, sharing a look with Rufus
Well, alright. I'll ... see you at school.

[B and S study on practice test handhelds, in the courtyard.]

  Blair, finishing
2200. Fair.

  Serena
It's 90th percentile!

  Blair
Which means Nelly Yuki probably got 2300.

  Serena
You don't even talk to her, why do you care how she does?

  Blair
Nelly Yuki has her sights set on Yale, too. What are the odds of them accepting two girls from Constance? And have you seen Nelly Yuki's extracurriculars? I need to kick her well-rounded ass.

  Serena
And they say you've lost your edge.

  Blair
Nelly Yuki must be destroyed.

  Serena
...Why do you keep saying her name?

  Blair
Because it's "Nelly Yuki!"

[S laughs lovingly.]

  Blair
Ew, gross. Incoming Chuck. (Gathering her stuff.) You ready?

  Serena
No, I gotta wait for Dan. He's pretty stressed. He doesn't do well with tests, so...

  Blair
Performance anxiety?

  Serena
Bye, Blair.

[B shoots Chuck a nasty look as she's leaving; he joins S.]

  Chuck
She really needs to tone down the social niceties. It's embarrassing.

  Serena
Eventually, the two of you are gonna have to work out your issues.

  Chuck
What issues? I'm issue-free. And based on my exhaustive research... So are you.

  Serena, anxious
Georgina?

  Chuck
According to my very reliable sources, Georgina Sparks is nowhere near our fair isle. She's in Switzerland, dating the prince of Belfort.

  Serena
There's a prince of Belfort? And she's dating him? Oh, thank God!

  Chuck
Now you can enjoy the gifts she mailed you with peace of mind... And maybe Chuck in the room?

  Serena, shoving him
Oh, shoot, except we're siblings!

  Chuck
Georgie always brought out the devil in you. Part of me is a little disappointed she's not here.

  Serena
Mm, I wonder which part.

  Chuck
It's been a while since I saw the old Serena.

  Serena
Well, thanks to her, the new one has to break 2000 on her SATs, so, if you could just go smarm elsewhere...

  Chuck
The offer still stands. I know a lovely little redhead that's just dying to be you for the day...

  Serena
Oh, I'll leave the cheating to you, Chuck. I plan on taking the SATs myself.

[Chuck leaves; S is relieved at his news.]

[Little J, Isabel, Hazel and Penelope walk down a Constance hallway.]

  Penelope
You have no idea how lucky you are.

  Hazel
Seriously, Jenny. I would do anything to be a freshman again.

  Penelope
Junior year sucks. Nate doesn't call, I'm not ready for the SATs...

  Isabel
Maybe I should join Kati on the Kibbutz in Israel, quit now.

  Jenny
You guys, it's just a test. Look, cram session tonight. My dad's making lasagna, my brother's got tons of flash cards, and I'm totally available to help.

  Blair, appearing
...That won't be necessary, Little J. You girls are all taken care of, Courtesy of Blair Waldorf SAT Prep & Spa.

  Hazel
Are you serious?

  Blair
If you're gonna sweat the test, better not clog your pores. This evening at my penthouse, you'll find personal tutors, hot stone massages, mani-pedis and an amazing acupuncturist who specializes in mental acuity.

  Jenny
Guess that beats my dad's lasagna.

  Blair
I'll flickr over some photos for you, it's upperclassmen only. I'm sure you understand.

  Jenny, sadly
Totally.

[After a moment, they turn and join B.]

  Hazel
Wait up, B.

  Isabel
I'm so glad I didn't book that flight to Tel Aviv.

  Gossip Girl
"Spotted in the halls of Constance: Little J. Realizing that age really does come before beauty."

[Lonelyboy meets N on the steps of the school; he's carrying a soccer ball.]

  Nate
SATs?

  Dan
Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, soccer? Why not ... give the old ball a kick, season's just around the corner... In October. No, no, you know what? I have to stop doing that. I'll just focus on myself, and my test, and my prep. What other people do, or don't do, is about them. Absolutely.

  Nate
Not a good tester, huh?

[He heads off; Serena approaches from behind and covers Dan's eyes, kissing him.]

  Dan
Oh, Chuck, I had no idea you felt that way about me.

  Serena
Good to know you're at least still ... kind of funny.

  Dan
Hey, I'm so sorry. I've been completely off the radar the past few days. New home, new family. It's okay.

  Serena
Yeah, it's, um, pretty overwhelming.

  Dan
Yeah, I've been a little overwhelmed myself lately.

  Serena, kissing him
Well, you wanna hang out? Study?

  Dan
Oh, I wanna take whatever SAT prep course you're signed up for.

  Serena
Well, it's not too late.

  Dan
Okay. I'm in, then. I'll see you.

[As Lonelyboy leaves, G appears behind S.]

  Georgina
You always did know how to leave them wanting more.

  Serena
Oh my God. Georgina.


      ACT TWO

[S and G, Still outside Constance.]

  Serena
...What are you doing here?

  Georgina
I told you I was coming! Didn't you get my gifts?

  Serena
Uh, you're supposed to be in Switzerland dating a prince.

  Georgina
Luckily daddy didn't need the G5. Haven't you missed me?

  Serena
...How could I not?

  Georgina
Okay. You don't want to throw me a homecoming party, I get it, but let's have a cocktail, Catch up. (S is troubled.) S, you're really gonna hurt my feelings... (Scarier.) And you know how I get when my feelings are hurt. (S gives in.) Great. I'll see you tonight. It's so weird seeing you, it's almost like I never left!

[G leaves; S stares, shaken.]

  Gossip Girl
"Spotted in the courtyard: Serena looking like she's seen a ghost. The ghost of parties past."

[Little J buys a hotdog from a street vendor; Elise runs up.]

  Elise
Jenny, why did you want to meet here?

  Jenny
Well, I've been thinking. What's the one thing that no one in our group has? I mean, not even Blair?

  Elise
Compassion?

  Jenny
No, a boyfriend. You know, if I'm gonna make it to queen, I need a king.

[They watch some prep school boys.]

  Elise
Queen Elizabeth never had a boyfriend.

  Jenny
But she only had the Spanish to conquer, and I have Blair Waldorf. Let's talk qualifications. He has to be cute (One boy stoops to check himself out in a parked car's rearview mirror) ... but not full of himself. He has to be from the right kind of family (two guys hit on a girl on the sidewalk) ... Ugh, but not disgusting.

[Elise laughs. A boy walking several dogs is shoved into Little J, and she drops her hotdog, which one of the dogs begins to chew on.]

  Asher
Whoa! Oh, oh, aw... I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

  Jenny
Yeah, uh, my lunch isn't, though.

  Asher
Oh, Linus. Let me give you... (He goes through his pockets.) My last dollar?

  Jenny
Oh, I couldn't. You shouldn't be walking the streets with no money.

  Asher
Let's just settle for an IOU then.

  Jenny
It's just a hotdog.

  Asher
That's just my excuse to give this to you. Here's my number.

  Jenny
Thank you! I mean... It's fine, I mean, I'm really not even that hungry.

  Asher
Well, if you change your mind...

[Little J tosses the number once he's gone.]

  Elise
What are you doing? He's gorgeous.

  Jenny
He's a dog walker. I need a king, not a jester. Come on. Let's go lurk outside Dalton.

["Campus," by Vampire Weekend; N enters Vanessa's coffeeshop and recognizes her.]

  Nate
Hey...?

  Vanessa
Vanessa. You're Nate, right? You play a very small but crucial role in my video project.

  Nate
Oh, that's right. I remember you following Dan around with your video camera.

  Dan, arriving with coffee
Hey, Nate. What are you doing here? I mean, I know the coffee's good...

  Nate, dropping several prep books on the table
Since I've taken every SAT prep and review class in the five boroughs, I figured why not pay it forward?

  Dan
So... So you don't need these?

  Nate
You know, I've actually already taken it. My parents don't want me going to USC, so I had to make sure my scores were good enough to get in without their help. Which thanks to these books, they were, so I'm done.

  Vanessa
While we all love hearing about the struggles of the idle rich, Dan's got a fine tutor right here. I ace every practice test I take. So we don't need your hand-me-downs.

  Dan
Um, you know what? This is actually pretty good. This looks good. Thank you.

  Vanessa
Is there a reason you insist on looking so desperate and needy?

  Dan, to Nate
She's been like that since we were kids. Venomous without provocation.

  Vanessa
It's better than being a charity case!

  Dan
She's rude, too.

  Nate, smiling
I see that, yeah... Well, I gotta get going, But I hope these are useful.

  Dan
Oh, yeah, yeah, very. Thank you. (Off a look from Vanessa.) What? Look. They're... Hey, every little bit helps.

[Vanessa pouts, notices a handwritten essay in one of the books, and starts reading it.]

["Crimewave," by Health, Crystal Castles Remix; S and G are having Cosmopolitans in a dark bar.]

  Serena
Is this really the best place for us to talk?

  Georgina
You of all people know nothing gets me talking like a Cosmo.

[Two guys raise their drinks to them from across the room.]

  Serena
You know, a lot has changed since we used to hang out, Georgie.

  Georgina
I know. I get it.

  Serena
No, you don't get it, or you wouldn't have sent me all those so-called "gifts" in the first place.

  Georgina
Oh come on, sweetie. Those were funny. Get over yourself, I was just trying to make you laugh! How about this. How about for one night, we hang out like old times, but unlike old times, I won't get out of control. Unless you want me to, I mean, I can totally get out of ... (S chuckles.) No, okay. I won't get out of control, and I totally respect that, please ... stop me any time you feel like answering. Any... Time. (S laughs.) Come on.

  Serena
One drink, but only one.

  Georgina
Cheers.

[Penelope, Isabel and Hazel enter the empty Waldorf penthouse, disappointed.]

  Penelope
...Where are all the tutors?

  Hazel
And the masseuses?

  Isabel
And the smoothies?

  Blair
All that I have promised you is waiting. And while it gives me great pleasure to think of us crossing that SAT finish line together, before the race can begin you need to be made aware of one little thing.

[B pulls up Nelly Yuki's MySpace.]

  Blair
Nelly Yuki, top in our class, Summer schooled at the Sorbonne.

  Penelope
Lots of people do summer at Sorbonne. Including me.

  Blair
True. Penelope, you may be a National Merit Scholar, but Nelly Yuki is a Merit Scholar, a Peabody Scholar and an Intel Science Talent Search Finalist. Isabel, you're a concert pianist, but Itzhak Perlman himself gave Nelly her very first violin. Hazel... You're just along for the ride, okay? But if any of us wants to live out our college dreams, we have to find Nelly Yuki's weakness and exploit it. So what's it gonna be, aromatherapy or annihilation?

  Penelope, after they all share a look
...What's the plan?

["Nice Sweet Sexy" by Difx, ft. Imperio & Cru. S and G have had more than just one drink, and are laughing hysterically.]

  Georgina
... It was like the worst thing ever! And then! And then, do you remember, do you remember when we ran out of money? And then I had to flash the bartender because we ran out of money ... Wait, wait! Oh my God, remember when we were Savannah and Svetlana?

  Serena
Oh, Savannah. Savannah! I totally forgot about Savannah and Svetlana.

  Georgina, in a Valley Girl accent
Wait, no. I think we were Tiffany and Angel that night.

  Serena
Oh, you could talk me into anything.

  Man, approaching
Hey, ladies, can I, uh, get you guys another round?

  Georgina
Ooh!

  Serena
No, thank you.

  Georgina, Russian accent
Oohh. My American girlfriend, so uptight! They think the drink lead to the s*x.

[Serena and the two guys laugh.]

  Serena, southern accent
No, no, no, I wasn't being rude, I just didn't want to take anything if I couldn't offer anything in return.

  Man
We'd be happy with just one dance...

  Serena
Awww, I'm afraid I have two left feet.

  Georgina
Ah! This is what is the practice for! Come on, lady!

  Both
Opa!

[G's phone rings; she tries to answer it away from S.]

  Serena
Who is that?

  Georgina
Um, no one. Uh, thank you for calling back.

  Serena, taking the phone
Nadine the Beauty Queen, how can I help you?

  Dealer, on the phone
I don't have time for this, do you want one or two g's?

  Georgina
Can you just give it...

  Serena
-- Some dealer you know?

  Georgina
I didn't realize I brought my grandmother...

  Serena, standing
I have to go.

  Man, grabbing her arm
Hey...

[S storms off, and G is sad until the guys pull her to the dancefloor. S calls Chuck.]

  Serena
I'm so stupid, so, so, so, so stupid.

  Chuck
You don't sound stupid, you sound drunk. What have you been into?

  Serena
Georgina. Good news is, she doesn't want anything except to party. Bad news is, I partied.

  Chuck
Care to paint a picture? Does this party require clothes?

  Serena
I'm supposed to be at Dan's studying. I called to tell him I'd be late, but not this late. I...I just have to call him and say...

  Chuck
That instead of studying with him, you're out with your old pal Georgina.

  Serena
No. I don't want him to know she exists. My Mom, Blair, even you can't stand her, Dan of all people cannot know Georgie. Can you help me?

  Chuck
Say you need me.

  Serena
Chuck!

  Chuck
Hearing you scream my name is more than enough. I'll take care of it, and pick you up in ten.

[Dan's phone rings: it's a Palace number.]

  Dan
Hey, I've been wondering where you were.

  Chuck
...You mean all of your life?

  Dan
Uh, don't take this the wrong way, Serena, but you sound just like this jackass we know.

  Chuck
Serena has food poisoning. She's too sick to come to your playdate.

  Dan
Put her on the phone.

  Chuck
The bathroom doesn't get reception.

  Dan
Somehow I don't believe you.

  Chuck
And I'd like to say I'm a little glad about that, But my poor, sick sister has asked for my assistance In the matter, so I'll leave it at this. She's not coming, don't try calling. Humphrey, always a pleasure.


      ACT THREE

[Dan approaches Chuck, talking on his phone in the St. Jude's courtyard; there is thunder.]

  Chuck
Okay, um... I'm gonna have to call you back.

  Dan
Hey.

  Chuck
Beautiful day you're ruining, isn't it?

  Dan
Do me a favor please, and leave Serena alone.

  Chuck
It was Serena I was doing the favor for.

  Dan
All I know is before spring break, everything was great. It was good. Now, break's over, she's not quite herself. And I'm trying to think, what has changed in her life? Oh, the Bass family moved into it.

  Serena, arriving with a kiss
Hi!

  Dan
Hey. Hey, how you feeling?

  Serena
Good. My migraine's gone.

[Chuck twitches at S, but it's too late.]

  Dan
Migraine? I thought you had food poisoning.

  Serena
Yeah, that ... came after.

  Dan
What exactly happened last night?

  Chuck
I already told him...

  Dan, pointing at Chuck without looking away
I'm asking you.

  Serena
Well, I got food poisoning, and then Chuck helped me out.

  Dan
Okay, where exactly did you eat that you got this killer food poisoning migraine?

  Serena
Can we drop the interrogation?

  Dan
As soon as you tell me where my girlfriend is.

  Serena
I'm right here with you.

  Dan, as the bell rings
Look, I gotta go to class. I can't... I can't do this.

  Serena
This is exactly why I didn't want her to come back. She's been back a day already and look what's happening.

  Chuck
If it's really that bad, why don't you just tell him about her?

  Serena
I ... can't. I'll see you later, okay?

[Military drums play while B's Army approaches Nelly Yuki.]

  Nelly Yuki
Look, I'm not stupid. I know you're not really interested in how my family owns half of TriBeCa.

  Hazel
Of course we're interested! You're the newest member of our little club.

  Penelope
Which is only for the smartest girls of the junior class.

  Nelly Yuki
Our junior class only has thirty girls, we're already an elite club. Can I go now?

  Hazel, off a mean look from B
You know what would be hot? You, us, at G Spa.

  Nelly Yuki
I don't drink.

  Penelope
Saks Fifth?

  Nelly Yuki
Hate shopping.

  Hazel
Yogurt on the steps?

  Nelly Yuki
Lactose-intolerant. Look, I really don't want any friends. All I want is to be alone and not to listen to Flo Rida ever again.

  Penelope, off another B look
What happened? A little backstage hit it and quit it?

  Nelly Yuki
What? No, my boyfriend broke up with me at a Flo Rida Concert. One minute we were waving our hands in the air like we just didn't care, and the next...

[Nelly Yuki takes off; B nods to her Army and starts downloading "Elevator."]

[Elise and Jenny walking with their umbrellas in the rain.]

  Elise
Since the Dalton guys were a bust, how about collegiate? The boys' lacrosse team is working out just around... Jenny, look.

  Jenny, spotting the dog walker
What did I tell you about that dog walker? There are no kings on Craigslist.

  Elise, watching him hand off the dogs
But I don't think he's the walker. I think he's the owner.

  Jenny, as he waves her over
I ...spy ...my ...king.

[Elise stares as she goes to chat with him.]

[B spots Nelly Yuki studying in the hall and plays "Elevator," Flo Rida ft. Timbaland, on her phone while she walks by.]

  Nelly Yuki
Oh God, not that song.

  Blair
Nelly Yuki, what's wrong?

  Nelly Yuki
It's like it's happening all over again. That song just reminds me of my boyfriend. ...My ex-boyfriend, I should say.

  Blair
Oh! ... No! Did he dump you? That's horrible. What... What was his name? Brad? Bill?

  Nelly Yuki
Todd. Jansen.

  Blair, kneeling
There's nothing like the fresh, sharp pain of a breakup. Believe me, I've had my fair share of heartache... But this is about you. Tonight you're gonna come over to my house, and just cry till you get it all out of your system.

  Nelly Yuki
I can't, I have to be focused tomorrow.

  Blair
You can't focus when something's on your mind, now can you? Come, come, come. (She closes Nelly Yuki's book.) Tell me all about it.

[She smiles sweetly and Nelly Yuki finally smiles back.]

[Brooklyn Greek diner; Vanessa checks her watch.]

  Vanessa
I guess I'll just take the check, please.

  Nate, sitting
Hey, hold that, will ya?

  Vanessa
Daylight Savings moved to March, maybe no one told you.

  Nate
I know I'm late.

  Waitress
Coffee, Nate?

  Nate
Yeah. Thanks, Cora.

  Vanessa
You two know each other?

  Nate
I've been here before.

  Vanessa
Are you telling me you come all the way to Brooklyn For Greek food?

  Nate
Well, when I'm Brooklyn I like to come here. Yes.

  Vanessa
...Because you're in Brooklyn all the time...

  Nate
Well ... my father's in rehab a couple blocks away, and um -- which, by the way, is why I'm late, I was... Visiting hours...

  Vanessa
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

  Nate
No. I mean, it's not like it's some big secret, it was on the front page of every newspaper in the city.

  Vanessa
I guess it was, yeah.

  Nate
Sometimes after I'm done seeing him, I'm not ready to go back and see my Mom just yet, so I come here and I sit and just, uh...

  Vanessa
Think about how hard it is to know whose side you're supposed to be on, Mom versus Dad, kid in the middle? Confession: I read one of your practice essays. You left it in a book that you gave Dan, and that's why I called you. To apologize.

  Nate
...Why?

  Vanessa
Because I judged the cover, but now that I've read the book, I figured you were owed some apologetic souvlaki at the very least.

[They smile and laugh.]

[S is walking down the street when her phone rings.]

  Serena
Hey, Georgie. It was good to see you last night. When did you say you were going back to Belgium?

  Georgina
Um, Switzerland, actually. And I'm supposed to leave tomorrow, but I'm not going until I get a chance to make it up to you first.

  Serena, lying
Oh, nothing to make up, I had fun!

  Georgina
No, you didn't. I mean, until after you left I don't think I really heard what you were saying. I-I didn't get it. You've really changed.

  Serena
Yeah, I have.

  Georgina
I don't mean to sound corny, but... It's a real inspiration to me.

  Serena
Really?

  Georgina
I mean look, I've always thought that I am who I'm going to be for the rest of my life, and even those times when I maybe don't like myself, well... You can't decide to be somebody else.

  Serena
No, you can...

  Georgina, with a huge glass of vodka
Yeah listen, let's have dinner. I-I mean, I want to hear about your life, and if you can change, maybe there's hope for me, too.

  Serena
No, I... I have to study. I have SATs in the morning.

  Georgina
It'll just be an hour. We can time it, I promise. The hardest drug on the table will be Perrier.

  Gossip Girl
"Spotted: Serena Van Der Woodsen, being given a real life multiple choice question. A: go home and study, B: get a good night's sleep, C: call your boyfriend, or D..."

  Serena
An hour.

  Gossip Girl
"...None of the above."

  Georgina
Good!

  Gossip Girl
"Hope that wasn't the wrong answer, S. This test doesn't grade on a curve."


      ACT FOUR

[Lonelyboy, studying on the Humphrey couch, annoys Little J, studying at the kitchen island.]

  Dan
All right, "capacious." Looks like ... "spacious." What does it mean? "Roomy." Oh yeah. "Captious." Looks like... That looks like "capacious." Oh, I can't concentrate.

  Jenny
Sound of your own voice distracting you?

  Dan
No. It's, uh, Serena, actually. We had an argument.

  Rufus
I'm home!

  Jenny, running to him
Oh, lookit! Trig identities are memorized, my Latin is resurrected, and my Lit paper's finished.

  Rufus
Impressive. ...Seeing as you've returned the Valentino

  Jenny
...I'm not grounded anymore?

  Rufus, producing a new sewing machine
I have something for you.

  Jenny
No way! Oh!

  Rufus
It's not exactly the same as the one you pawned, but...

  Jenny, squealing
Thank you, Dad!

  Dan
You know, Jen, no one's happier than me to see this. Do you know how much it costs to get a zipper repaired?

  Rufus
Yeah, I figured since you'd be spending so much time at home...

  Jenny
...Wait. What?

  Dan
So I guess you're still grounded.

  Rufus
Dan.

  Jenny
Dad, wait. I met this really nice guy, and I'm supposed to meet him in the Park for lunch tomorrow.

  Rufus
Well, grounded or not grounded, you're not old enough to date.

  Jenny
It's not a date. He's just a friend.

  Dan
Who is this guy?

  Jenny
You don't know him. He goes to Unity.

  Rufus
Wait, Upper-East-Side Unity?

  Dan
Technically that's Upper West Side, Dad.

  Rufus
How are you helping? (To Jenny.) I thought you wanted to take a break from that whole crowd.

  Jenny
What whole crowd?

  Rufus
The one that made you feel like compromising your character was a prerequisite to hanging out with them.

  Jenny
So it's okay for Dan to date someone rich, though?

  Dan
Well, it's not without its complications, believe me.

  Rufus
I thought you said it wasn't a date.

[Jenny screams and runs, slamming her bedroom door.]

  Rufus
...It was nice there for a minute.

  Dan
Yeah, it was.

[B and her Army drink smoothies in the parlor while she leaves a voicemail for S.]

  Blair
Hey S, I'm just sipping a gingko biloba blended smoothie and wondering how your stomach-migraine is. Call me so I don't worry. (Hangs up.) How you doing, Nelly Yuki?

  Nelly Yuki
My upper trapezius seems to hold a lot of sadness.

  Blair
Aww, something tells me you'll be feeling better very soon. Any minute.

  Nelly Yuki
No. I think I should just go home and study.

[Nelly Yuki tries to get up, but a sharp look from B makes the masseuse shove her down again, hard.]

  Dorota
Mr. Jansen is here to see Miss Yuki.

  Nelly Yuki
Todd's here? Do I have cushion face?

  Isabel, to a look from B
A little.

  Nelly Yuki, scrambling to put her glasses back on
Hello, Todd.

  Todd
Hi, Nelly. Blair said it was all right if I came.

  Nelly Yuki
For a Siberian Ginseng pedi?

  Todd
No. I really feel bad about how things ended, Nell.

  Nelly Yuki
So do I.

  Todd, sharing a meaningful glance with B
Can we talk about it? In private?

  Nelly Yuki
Okay! Thank you, B!

[They leave.]

  Blair
Lucky for us, mental acuity and common sense rarely come in the same package.

[The girls giggle.]

  Blair
Oxygen facials, anyone?

[N and Vanessa, headed down the street in Brooklyn.]

  Nate
Next time your sister's band is in town, I want front row seats.

  Vanessa
You don't strike me as a lesbian punk fan.

  Nate
You know, I am almost offended by how much you underestimate me, Ms. Abrams.

  Vanessa
You like punk?

  Nate
Oh, I didn't hear you s... You said "punk"? Cause you had me at "lesbian."

  Vanessa
Oh, right. Didn't see that one coming.

  Nate
Hey, tell me something.

  Vanessa
Yes?

  Nate
Why do you do SAT practice tests if you're not planning on taking the exam?

  Vanessa
To help Dan study. I'm a filmmaker, best education for me is making films.

  Nate
I've never met ... anyone who thought college was optional.

  Vanessa
My parents are artists, my sister's a musician. Just like going to an Ivy is your family's way, not going to college is mine.

  Nate
Think your parents want to adopt a 17 year old? Maybe?

[They reach the coffeeshop and she takes out her keys.]

  Nate
So...

  Vanessa
So...

  Nate
I guess this is good night, then?

  Vanessa
I don't live here, you know.

  Nate
No, I know.

  Vanessa
I'm just grabbing my laptop.

  Nate
Oh.

  Vanessa
Do you want to come inside?

  Nate
Um...

  Vanessa
God. It does feel like that doorstep moment.

  Nate, kissing her
And what moment would that be?

  Vanessa
Yeah. That's the moment.

[They go inside, still kissing.]

[S and G in a booth at a restaurant while "We Started Nothing" by The Ting Tings plays.]

  Waitress
Can I get you two a cocktail?

  Georgina, after a moment
Oh... I'm fine with my Diet Coke, thank you.

  Serena
Um, yeah. Me too. Thanks.

  Georgina
So... Tell me about Dan.

  Serena
I did.

  Georgina
Oh, come on. His last name and his zip code? Scintillating details. Come on! He's part of Serena, second edition!

  Serena
Well... I like the way I feel when he looks at me.

  Georgina
How?

  Serena
Like... Like I wanna believe in myself. I know, you think it's a clich?

  Georgina
Uh, no. No, sweetie. I think it's... It's incredible.

  Serena
Yeah.

  Georgina
Look... I know I may not be your most trusted friend right now, but I think I know the old you pretty well.

  Serena
Yeah, better than, um, anyone, actually.

  Georgina
Well, from where I sit, it would take a lot to bring that person back.

  Serena
Um... I'm gonna call him, actually. He's pretty nervous about tomorrow, so I wanna wish him luck. So I'll be back.

[S leaves the table and G's smile falls; she dumps a vial of GHB in S's Diet Coke and sits back as S returns.]

  Georgina
That was quick!

  Serena
Yeah, he didn't pick up.

  Georgina
Oh, you can try him again later.

  Serena
Yeah.

  Georgina
Okay, I'd like to propose a toast.

  Serena
Okay.

  Georgina
To the new you.

  Serena, proudly
To the new me.

  Georgina
Cheers!


      ACT FIVE

[S wakes up in her clothes, in G's bed, moaning and confused.]

  Georgina
Ooh, you don't look so good. You okay, S?

  Serena
No, I'm not okay. Wait, how did we get here? What are we doing here? Oh my God, I'm supposed to be at Hunter College...

  Georgina
If memory serves, and it usually does, they don't let you in if you're late.

  Serena
Oh my God.

  Georgina, hopping on the bed to call room service
I'm thinking eggs. Do you want Florentine or Benedict?

  Serena
Wait. I was drinking soda, Georgie.

  Georgina
Yeah, until you switched to Patron. Look, don't worry. I called Lily and covered your ass. So... You're welcome.

  Serena
No! You... You knew I had SATs this morning.

  Georgina
Which is why I brought you here, instead of letting you go home with one of your many suitors. You know the guy with the ironic mustache? You two took over the DJ booth...

  Serena
Wait, a mustache? What are you talking about?

  Georgina
I guess you haven't changed as much as you thought.

  Serena, on the phone
Chuck? Chuck, hey, I'm in trouble. Look, I think I can still make it, but please go to Hunter, try to keep the doors open until I get there.

[N is waiting outside the coffeeshop when Vanessa arrives for work.]

  Vanessa
Hey! Last night was strange, but very fun. Still, didn't we just say goodbye like five hours ago?

  Nate
I'm taking you somewhere.

  Vanessa
I'm going somewhere. To work.

  Nate
Get someone to cover for you.

  Vanessa
I can't just jump in the car with you because you decide to show up.

  Nate
Well, I'm not asking you to. This is a one-time offer, and there's a clock ticking.

  Vanessa
But... (N makes a face.) Fine. I am intrigued.

[Little J and Rufus have a silent breakfast while Lonelyboy takes his SAT.]

  Rufus
...You wish your brother good luck today?

  Jenny
Yeah. (Silence.) ...May I be excused?

  Rufus
No, you may not. And we are not gonna walk around this house all day and not talk to each other.

  Jenny
Fine. You want me to speak? I'll speak. You've completely and entirely prejudged the Upper East Side.

  Rufus
Maybe you shouldn't speak...

  Jenny
Dad, I learned my lesson on my birthday. Asher's not like those girls. He's different, he's nice, and polite, and he likes animals. Please let me go today?

  Rufus
So you didn't cancel?

  Jenny
I thought you'd change your mind.
Rufus, tossing down his fork and giving her the phone: I haven't.

[N and Vanessa approach Hunter College.]

  Vanessa
Nate, I don't know about this. I can't. I didn't even study!

  Nate
Yeah, you still made great scores on your practice tests.

  Vanessa
That was for fun.

  Nate
Listen, there's nothing wrong with keeping your options open. I don't think your parents are gonna be mad at you for choosing your own path. Unless they're related to my parents.

  Vanessa
Okay. Right now I'm going inside, and I'm not looking back or I might change my mind.

[B and her Army catch Nelly Yuki coming up the steps looking busted.]

  Blair
Rough night?

  Nelly Yuki
Yeah, and not in a good way. Todd doesn't wanna get back together.
:

  Blair
No? But he said...

  Nelly Yuki, dropping her calculator
We stayed up all night having the same conversation about why we broke up, over and over again.

  Blair, retrieving and returning the calculator
Unbelievable. I can't believe it. Crazy.

  Nelly Yuki
I got no sleep, spent the whole night crying...

  Blair
-- Okay! Well, good luck.

[They walk away.]

  Isabel
Do you really think this is gonna work?
Blair, producing the batteries from her calculator: Yes, but I also believe in insurance.

  Isabel
You never did tell us how you got Todd to play along.

  Blair
Isabel, what are you doing later tonight?

  Isabel
Uh, not Todd.

  Blair
Okay. Well, I guess I'm gonna have to come up with something else.

[B meets Lonelyboy at registration.]

  Blair
...Where's Serena?

  Dan
Uh, I don't know, but I bet Chuck does.

  Blair
Ugh. Well, I'll try to save a seat for her.

  Dan
Yeah, I'll ... I'll keep calling.

[B leaves and he tries S's phone again.]

  Dan
Hey, Serena, it's me. A... a very worried me, concerned about a very missing you."

  Redhead, at the registration tables
Hi. I'm Serena Van Der Woodsen?

[Lonelyboy stares at Fake S.]


      ACT SIX

[B and Lonelyboy walk out of the test together.]

  Blair
How'd you do?

  Dan
Uh, not my finest hour. I finished, but... I kinda had a lot on my mind.

  Blair
I'll keep calling.

  Dan
Yeah. I think I know where to find her.

[Lonelyboy heads down the steps, but sees N picking Vanessa up after the test, and stares.]

  Blair, on phone
Hey S, it's B. Now I'm really worried. I'm gonna go home and change, and then... (She sees Vanessa and N.) Call me, bye.

[Lonelyboy and B stare as N's towncar drives away.]

[Lonelyboy knocks on Chuck's door; S waits a moment before opening it.]

  Dan, relieved
Hey!

  Serena
Hey.

  Dan
What's going on?

  Serena, stepping back
Um... Nothing. I'm fine.

  Dan
No you're not, and you need to stop saying that. Hey, come here. Where were you?

  Chuck, appearing
She was with me.

  Serena
What he means is, we were both at home. Um, my stomach started acting up again...

  Dan
Oh, okay. A food poisoning relapse? Look, if... If you didn't study enough and you're freaked out, I can...

  Serena
-- I told you. I was sick.

  Dan
You paid someone else to take the SAT for you, and that's the best you can do?

  Serena
What are you talking about?

  Dan
I'm talking about the five-foot-nothing redhead claiming to be Serena Van Der Woodsen. I'm... I'm pretty sure that wasn't you.

  Serena
Chuck, what did you do? I told you to keep the doors open. When I got there, they were closed.

  Chuck
Yeah, they don't keep the doors open. I was thinking on my feet, just trying to help.

  Dan, touching her face
I'm not mad, okay? I'm just worried. I've been so worried about you. Please, help me understand what's going on here.

  Serena, sadly
Can we talk tomorrow? I'll call you. I'm sorry.

  Dan
I'm sorry, too.

[Chuck reaches to close the door, and Dan leaves.]

  Serena
Chuck, you went too far.

  Chuck
And so did you, sis. Look, I feel foolish for admitting it, but obviously I've come late to this party.

  Serena
English, please.

  Chuck
What's Georgina got on you?

  Serena
Chuck...

  Chuck
Dan, I understand -- but what's so bad you can't even tell me?

[S walks away.]

[G answers a knock at the door; it's S.]

  Georgina
Oh, hi sweetie. Let me just, uh, call some room service...

  Serena, from the doorway
I don't want you to ever contact me again.

  Georgina
Just because of a few nights of harmless fun?

  Serena
It wasn't fun waking up and not knowing where I was, it wasn't fun missing the SATs, and it definitely wasn't fun lying to Dan.

  Georgina
And this is all my fault because...

  Serena
-- My fault. Because I make huge mistakes when I'm with you.

  Georgina
So you want to distance yourself from your mistakes by staying away from me? You were there too, Serena. It was just as much you, if not more...

  Serena
-- This is not about last year. It's about last night.

  Georgina
Like you were just some innocent bystander who walked in on...

  Serena
I'm not talking about it, Georgina! Okay? And neither are you. If I go down, you go down with me. In the meantime, stay out of my life.

  Georgina
I don't need anybody in my life who doesn't want to be there.

  Serena
Then we're agreed.

[Georgina slams the door, and starts to pack angrily before changing her mind.]

[Rufus answers the door at the loft; it's Asher.]

  Rufus
You must be the Unity boy.
Asher, shifting a big paper bag full of hotdogs to shake hands: Uh, hopefully there's not another one on his way. Name's Asher, and I do go to Unity. Hi.

  Jenny, appearing
Asher? What are you doing here?

  Rufus
I was just gonna ask the same thing.

  Asher, showing her the bag
Uh, since you couldn't come to the hotdogs, I'm bringing them to you. Sorry to surprise you, sir.

  Jenny
That's so sweet, especially since my unreasonable father has grounded me for life.

  Rufus
I'm standing right here.

  Asher
I wish more of my friends' parents cared enough to ground them when they messed up.

  Gossip Girl
Looks like our queen wannabe's found her perfect king.

  Rufus
Well, since you're here, with a ... year's supply of hotdogs, maybe you'd like to come in.

  Gossip Girl
"We hear he's a Unity man. Guess big brother's been teaching little sis how to snag the ones with a trust fund."

[Lonelyboy broods in the park; a golden retriever runs up.]

  Dan
Hey, buddy. There you go.

  Georgina
Aw! Georgie, hey! Bad boy! Sorry he disturbed you.

  Dan
Uh, it's fine. I love dogs.

  Georgina
Really? Do you have any?

  Dan
No. Uh, we used to have a cat, but, you know, sister, allergies. Now the cat, Iggy, lives in Florida with my Grandma. I... He doesn't write. Never calls.

  Georgina
I'm sorry to hear that.

  Dan, handing her the leash
It's just a cat.

  Georgina
Um. I'm Sarah, by the way.

  Dan
I'm Dan. Nice to meet you, Sarah.

      END OF EPISODE





      PREVIOUSLY

  Jenny, meeting Asher
What's the one thing that no one in our group has? I mean, not even Blair? A boyfriend.

  Jenny
I met this really nice guy, and I'm supposed to meet him in the park for lunch tomorrow.

  Rufus
...You're not old enough to date.

  Asher, at the door
Name's Asher, and I do go to Unity.

  Lily, cooking with Rufus
He's been staying at the Ostroff Center.

  Rufus
It's depression? Is it bad?

  Lily
Bad enough to try to kill himself...
Constance Billard

  Serena
Oh my God, Georgina. What are you doing here?

  Georgina
Well, I told you I was coming. Didn't you get my gifts?

  Chuck
What's Georgina got on you? Dan I understand. What's so bad you can't even tell me?

  Georgina
So... tell me about Dan.

  Serena
Dan of all people cannot know Georgie.
Central Park

  Georgina
Um, I'm Sarah.

  Dan
Nice to meet you, Sarah.

  Gossip Girl
"And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell. You know you love me. XOXO, Gossip Girl."
MOMA Steps

  Gossip Girl
"Spotted: Jenny Humphrey wading in the Met fountain, fishing for change... Blair Waldorf, seen dallying with an off-duty doorman at the Blarney Stone on a Monday night. It looks like the battle Between the Queen B and Little J has moved from the streets to the blogs. Who's sending this debasing dish? I have a feeling..."

  Blair
A nice, shiny dime to add to your collection?

  Jenny
Why the fruit cup, B? Lost your taste for yogurt?

  Blair
... So what are we doing tonight?

  Penelope
Asher's parents are in Cannes, so he and Jenny are throwing a party at his house.

  Jenny
It's a really small get-together with just our closest friends. Sorry, Blair.

  Nelly Yuki
Blair can take my place.

  Jenny, to Nelly Yuki
Invitations are nontransferable. (to Blair) She's new to the group.

  Blair
Just because your name's on the invite doesn't make you a hostess.

  Jenny, answering phone
Oh? Then why is the party planner calling me? Excuse me, girls.
Aside

  Jenny
Hey Dad? I'm kinda busy. What's up?

  Rufus, reading her evite from her laptop
I was just wondering what time you want me to serve your favorite home-cooked meal tonight. Maybe around eight?

  Jenny
Oh, um, I have that choir thing. Remember, I talked to you about it, and you said I could go 'cause I've been good?

  Rufus
Oh, right. Well, maybe we could wait to eat till after you got home then. You're gonna be hungry after all that singing.

  Jenny, hanging up
Yeah, well, I mean, they have food there, and it's probably gonna go pretty late. So, um... tomorrow? 'Kay, love you.

  Rufus
Love you, too...
Steps

  Jenny
Sorry. Floral emergency. Oh, and you will be happy to know that the entire Unity Lacrosse team RSVP'd.

  Penelope
Oh my God, it's Asher.

  Jenny, dragging the girls off
Let's go say hi.

  Blair
How did little Jenny Humphrey become the next Brooke Astor?

  Isabel
The same way they all do.

  Nelly Yuki
Marry up.
Walking to school from the Palace

  Serena
Hey, why the long face? Are you still sad Mom wouldn't let you go to Monte Carlo for the bachelor party?

  Eric
No, I'm fine, I figured I'd let Bart, Chuck and Prince Albert have their fun... Oh, that didn't come out like I meant it. (Checking phone) Um... Gossip Girl. Looks like Jenny's been spotted at Gap sewing Stella McCartney labels into pocket tees.

  Serena
These rumors are getting to be ridiculous.

  Eric
Oh, like the one where I'm Gossip Girl?

  Serena
Hey, it made sense at the time.

  Eric
It never made any sense.

  Serena
Yeah, it did!

  Eric
No, it didn't.

  Serena, phone ringing
Wait, hold on. It's Chuck.

  Eric
I have something to do before school starts, but tell him I say hi?

  Serena
Okay. Don't forget about dinner tonight.

  Eric
Yeah.

  Serena
Salut, Chuck. Yes, I'm still fine. I haven't heard from Georgina in two weeks. So if you'd stop calling me, I'd finally be rid of all of my monsters. Bye.
Coffeeshop

  Vanessa
You can read about it all day long, but you have to walk the city to know it.

  Georgina
Okay, but look, anything is better than getting lost on the train every day.

  Vanessa
Subway. Click those heels all you want, you're not in Portland anymore.

  Georgina
Seriously, you and Dan are so sweet to adopt me. I-I'd be a mess without you guys. Well, more of a mess than I already am.

  Vanessa
Red-eye to go?

  Dan, in a hurry
Yes, please. Thank you. Hey, Sarah. Sorry for talking your ear off the other night, guys.

  Vanessa
He tends to ramble, as you'll get to know.

  Dan
Yeah.

  Georgina
Well, I'm a good listener, as he'll get to know. Are there any new developments?

  Dan
Uh, no. No, more of the same. Jenny and her boyfriend are still inseparable, and she's even more insufferable.

  Vanessa
Give her a break. Asher's her first love.

  Dan
It's infatuation. It's not love.

  Georgina
Yeah, but to a fifteen-year-old girl, I mean, there really isn't a difference.

  Vanessa
And how long did it take you, Dan?

  Dan
Um, that's a little different, Vanessa. It took me...

  Vanessa
Uh, one glance at a ninth grade birthday party?

  Dan
Yes, but two years to obsess over it.

  Georgina
So things are better with...Serena?

  Dan
Serena. Yeah. Yeah, good memory. Right. Things are finally back to normal.

  Georgina
Good. Well, I mean... You know, it's tough making friends in a new city. It'd be really nice to meet her.

  Dan
Yeah, Serena would love you. She loves everybody. Not that she would only like you Because she doesn't discriminate. Um... ahem. See what she meant about that rambling thing? How's tonight?

  Georgina
Tonight would be perfect.

  Dan
Good. See you.
Constance Billard

[Asher and Jenny mack, while the girls watch. Eric is in the shadows. When Asher leaves, the girls all giggle and squeal, and Eric approaches.]

  Jenny
...Oh, my God! He's so cute!

  Eric
Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?

  Jenny
Sure. Is something wrong?

  Eric
That's what I was gonna ask you. Where have you been lately? You haven't returned any of my calls.

  Jenny
Sorry. It's been harder than I thought to keep up with schoolwork, and the new spring social calendar, and my new boyfriend...

  Eric
Yeah. Asher, right?

  Jenny
Yeah. He's cute and smart and basically perfect, and the best part is I think he really likes me.

  Eric
Well, then he has good taste. But... how well do you actually know him?

  Jenny
Oh, that's so sweet. You're being protective.

  Eric
No, I'm not. But... yes. Yes, I am. I've got nothing against him. I just... Something about him makes me feel maybe he's not the right guy for you.

  Jenny
Oh my God. Wait. Do you have a crush on me or something?

  Eric
No, I don't. I just want ...

  Jenny, running off
Don't be embarrassed. It's cute. I mean, and not so unexpected, actually. I'm flattered. It's just... My heart belongs to Asher. I actually gotta go, but, um, text me, 'kay?

  Eric
Oh. Bye.
Constance Billard

  Serena, kissing Dan
What? You're here! Mmm, and you're late.

  Dan
I know. I come bearing apologies and an invitation. What are you up to tonight?

  Serena
I know what I'm not up to. Having fun. The SAT tutor was over for four hours last night.

  Dan
Mm. So this tutor, is he... Is he cute?

  Serena
Mm, well, if hair in the ear is your thing... I hate that since I'm not gonna use the score Chuck bought for me, I have to study every night. I can't even be distracted by ... that... Mmm. That.

  Dan, kissing her
I see your point. So then how about, um, dinner tonight with Sarah instead?

  Serena
Oh, Sarah again. What is she, your new girlfriend or something?

  Dan
Yeah. Just kidding. But she's new in town, and she does want to meet you.

  Serena
Well, since Bart and Chuck are out of town, I already agreed to a quiet family dinner in our old suite. I'm sorry. What about tomorrow?
Dan, distracted by Jenny and Asher making out in the courtyard: ...No, my... My sister and tongue. The two things that don't go together so well.

  Serena
Oh! Lighten up. You have been down on him since the beginning. Give him a chance and then judge. Maybe he'll surprise you, like I did.

  Dan
How are you always so right?

  Serena
It's easy when you're always wrong. Hey, you got first period free. Why don't you go get to know him? Go!

  Dan
Okay. Okay. All right, okay.

[Stalker Georgina watches from across the street as Dan leaves Constance, texting her that Serena can't do dinner. They both spot Asher making out with a St. Jude's boy. Dan hides once Asher kisses him and heads toward his own]school, and the other boy vanishes, but Georgina saw them both.)

  Gossip Girl
"And the only thing more shocking than the truth ... are the lies people tell to cover it up."
Outside the Palace, heading toward the towncar

  Lily, to Claudette
When you revise the seating chart, don't forget to place Mr. Spitzer as far away from Serena's table as possible. Thank you. Ugh. What is not on the schedule today?

  Rufus
I don't think I am. Maybe you could fit me in between Preston Bailey and Sylvia Weinstock?

  Lily
Well, good luck fitting anything between those two. What... What are you doing here?

  Rufus
Well, believe it or not, I'm here to see you.

  Lily
Well, I have a laundry list of things to do today...

  Rufus
-- It's about Jenny. Alison's away on an artists' retreat, and I could really use a mother's advice. I think I might be in over my head.

  Lily
I suppose we could talk about it on the way.
Unity Courtyard

[Asher's messing around with his lacrosse buddies as Dan approaches.]

  Dan
Hey, Asher. How's it going? You got a minute?

  Asher
Yeah. Uh, but just a minute. Jenny and I have a lunch date.

  Dan
Well, look, there's no easy way to say this, honestly, so I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna say it. I-I, uh, saw you this morning.

  Asher
Saw me what?

  Dan
I saw you... you know, I saw you kissing that guy.

  Asher
You got the wrong person.

  Dan
Come on, man. I-I-I don't think I do.

  Asher
Are you calling me queer?

  Dan
That's... not at all what I said.

  Asher, getting in his face
You wanna know how queer I am? I'm so queer, I'm gonna pop your sister's cherry tonight.

  Dan, attacking
Hey! What'd you say?!

  Jenny, appearing
What are you doing? Stop it!

  Dan
Jenny, I need to talk to you in private.

  Jenny
Well, anything you have to say to me, you can say in front of my boyfriend.

  Dan
Okay. All right, fine. Your boyfriend is not being honest with you.

  Asher
I wasn't gonna tell you yet, but I... Wanted to invite you to the country house this weekend. Your brother thought we were moving too fast and got upset.

  Jenny
Dan, can't you just let me be happy for once?

  Dan
Jenny, I want you to be happy. Just not with a guy who--

  Jenny
Yeah, I understand that you're threatened by him, because clearly he's everything you wanna be. He's good-looking and worldly, a legacy at Dartmouth. But even you should know that jealousy clashes with LL Bean pants.
Lunch on the steps

  Serena
It's a snub from one party, B. Plus what's the big deal anyway? You don't even like Asher.

  Blair
I didn't like last season's Louis Vuitton patchwork bag either, but that doesn't mean I want to see it all over town on Jenny Humphrey's arm.

  Serena
Touch.

  Blair
What do you say we have a girls' night out tonight?

  Serena
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't. I have dinner with the family.

  Blair
Let me remind you of a little promise you made. "Don't go to France. I'll be there for you."

  Serena
I'm really sorry I've been distant, but things will be better soon, I promise.

  Blair
Obviously starting tomorrow...

[Dan comes running over and kisses her, looking distraught.]

  Dan
Hey.

  Serena
Hey. What's wrong? You look stressed, even for you.

  Dan
I'm still worried about Jenny.

  Blair
You mean because she's self-obsessed, self-serving, self-centered, self...

  Dan
No. No, I wish it was about her and her ... self ... But it's more about who she's with. I can't get through to her. I tried, and she just completely blew me off. And she dissed my pants.

  Blair
Maybe I underestimated her.

  Serena
She's just going through a phase. We all went through it. (To Blair) ...And apparently, some of us still are in it...

  Blair
All that matters to someone like Jenny right now are the four Gs: Guys, Girlfriends and Gossip Girl.

  Serena
It's true. Don't feel bad. Unless it's coming from one of them, she's not gonna hear it.

[Dan has a horrible plan.]
Jewelry store

  Man, offering white wine
Here we go.

  Rufus
Ah, thank you. I tell her she can't see Asher, she calls him. I take away her phone, they're on iChat. How do you keep them from growing up when they can have a full relationship from the confines of their own bedrooms?

  Lily
Well, the answer is you can't. She's gonna grow up no matter what.

  Rufus
I read her e-mail.

  Lily
Well, you can't be too concerned about their privacy when their well-being is at stake, especially if you think they're lying to you. Was she?

  Rufus
Right to my face. I know Serena went through a similar phase...

  Lily
Well, if Serena's indiscretions were as PG as Jenny's, I wouldn't have needed the Botox.

  Rufus
Dan was so much easier.

  Lily
Well, raising girls is different. Serena would be a horrible monster for a hundred days, and then on the hundred and first, she'd be my little girl again.

  Rufus
So I just wait and hope, huh?

  Lily
Well, that's the hardest part. You have to trust that you've done your job. She'll come back to you. (Distracting herself with a diamond bracelet) That's...

  Rufus
It's perfect.

  Lily
Beautiful.

  Man
It's my finest piece.

  Rufus, putting it on her
Here. Let me.

  Lily
Mark Ingram, it's beautiful. You've outdone yourself. Oh, wow.
Constance Billard
The girls make their way down the hall, reading Gossip Girl.

  Gossip Girl
"This just in: Asher Hornsby spotted locking lips before class... But not with his girlfriend. Looks like gentlemen don't prefer blondes, Little J. They prefer other gentlemen."

  Hazel, laughing
Now you know how Vanessa Hudgens feels.

  Gossip Girl
"Is this just another round of blanks fired between B and Little J? I'm tired of being the bearer of bad grudges. This is the last item that goes to press without proof."

  Isabel
I'm so glad Gossip Girl finally got her balls back.

  Penelope
Yeah, she was totally turning into the new Page Six.

[Blair runs into them coming the other way.]

  Jenny
Low blow.

  Blair
Wasn't me. Wish it was!
Constance Courtyard

  Serena, answering phone
Hello?

  Luke
Miss van der Woodsen? It's Luke from the concierge's desk. You asked that we call first before delivering anything upstairs?

  Serena
Is there something for me?

  Luke
Yes, a package from a Miss Georgina Sparks... Hello? Did I lose you?

  Serena
Uh, no. Uh, just keep it there. I'll pick it up right after school. And don't let it out of your sight.

  Luke
Of course.

  Serena
Thank you.

  Dan, appearing
What was that about?

  Serena, distracted
Nothing. It's just this... Nothing. I'll see you later, okay? Bye.

  Dan
Bye. Hey...

  Serena, leaving
Hey, B.

[Serena leaves and Blair confronts Dan.]

  Blair
Dan Humphrey. Just who I hate to admit I was looking for. You're dirty!

  Dan
Wha... Uh, what are you talking about?

  Blair
Cheating, drinking, drugs, It's all fair game. But outing your sister's boyfriend is dark. How did squeaky-clean Humphrey even come up with that?

  Dan
I didn't come up with anything.

  Blair
Oh my God, you know something. Spill it.

  Dan
Yeah, I might have seen Asher kissing another guy.

  Blair
So it's true? Who was he kissing?

  Dan
I don't know. I don't... I don't know. I couldn't see. But what does that even matter?

  Blair
Right now Gossip Girl's credibility is the same as Tinsley Mortimer's after a few martinis. But if I can prove that his duplicity is more than just a rumor, then they'll break up. That's what you want, isn't it?

  Dan
Well yeah, I guess. Yeah...

  Blair
Asher's just using your sister as a cover. It's your brotherly duty to save her from becoming the next Katie Holmes.

  Dan
And you're in this to help Jenny?

  Blair
Motive is irrelevant as long as our endgame is the same.

  Dan
No, Blair, this is not a game to me, okay? I don't want her to get hurt.

  Blair
Well, you should've thought that through before you told all of Manhattan that Jenny's a glorified hag.

  Dan, leaving in a huff
You know what? I... You're on your own. I'm done.

  Blair
Suit yourself.
Bridal shop

[Lily tries on dresses behind the curtain.]

  Lily
Really, Rufus. What were you thinking? You threw her a surprise birthday party and had her face painted on a cake? With a tiara?

  Rufus
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

  Lily
Yeah, well, so did flannel and acid-washed jeans, but they weren't flattering either.

[The curtains open on Lily, looking ravishing; Rufus stares.]

  Lily
What is it? Is it too much?

[He's still gaping.]

  Lily
Uh, is it not enough?

  Rufus
It's not the dress. It's you in it.

  Lily
I'm sorry. I thought... I didn't mean... We're here as friends, right?

  Rufus
No, we are friends. It's just how you look.
Constance hallway

  Penelope
Nothing new on Gossip Girl for three hours. Guess she wasn't kidding about her new standards.

  Serena, twirling Jenny around
Hey, Jenny! Sorry I can't chat, but have so much fun at your party tonight!

  Penelope
She's totally running to a booty call with your brother.

  Jenny
I cannot believe you just went there.

  Hazel
And where have you gone, Little J?

  Penelope
Yeah, you and Asher...

  Jenny
Far enough.

  Hazel
Playing coy only means one thing.

  Isabel
Maybe Asher doesn't like girls.

  Jenny
Is that why we went to third?

  Elise
You went to third?

  Jenny
No, he did.

  Hazel
Well done. Make him work for it.
Waldorf apartment

[Blair, Nelly Yuki and Iz toss their purchases onto Blair's bed.]

  Blair
Whoever said that money doesn't buy happiness didn't know where to shop. Lucky for me, I may have to go out tonight after all. Did you get it?

  Nelly Yuki
Lucky for you, Iz knows five ways to sneak into the Unity boys' locker room, and six to sneak out.

  Isabel, handing over Asher's phone
Asher takes an abnormally long shower after practice.

  Nelly Yuki
Maybe his lacrosse stick isn't the only thing he likes to play with!

  Isabel
Why'd you want his phone so badly anyway?

  Blair
It was once said that a person's eyes are the windows to their soul. That was before people had cell phones.

[Blair downloads all of Asher's emails onto her laptop.]
Hornsby Residence

  Jenny, coming up the stairs
Hey...

  Asher, working on his laptop
This is a surprise. Party's not for a couple hours.

  Jenny, climbing onto him
Yeah, well, a lot can happen in a couple hours.

  Asher, laughing nervously
Uh, Jenny. What are you doing?

  Jenny
What's wrong?

  Asher
It... Nothing's wrong. This... It just isn't what we do. Are you suddenly ... not happy? I... I'm holding up my end of the bargain.

  Jenny
What bargain?

  Asher
You're Jenny Humphrey, from Brooklyn. You need status, access, resources. I give that to you.

  Jenny
What do I give you?

  Asher
Do we really need to talk about this?

  Jenny
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we do. So what was on Gossip Girl's true?

  Asher
Do you really think someone like me would just date someone like you?

  Jenny
But you've been so nice.

  Asher
And I'll keep being nice. Nothing has to change, okay?

  Jenny
Asher...

  Asher
Come on, Jenny. Tonight you're hosting your first Upper East Side party. That's something that Blair and those girls can never take away from you.

  Jenny
I know. Thank you.

  Asher
You're welcome. And... There is something you can do to show your thanks. I think it would be better for both of us if we put those rumors to rest once and for all.

  Jenny
What do you want me to do?
Palace

[Serena opens the package: a USB drive on an ivory ribbon, with a note from G: "memories fade, video is forever!"]

  Georgina
"If you put the camera here, she'll never know..."

  Man
"Are you sure she's gonna be down for this?"

  Georgina
"It's Serena. She goes down for anything."

[Serena enters.]

  Georgina
"Hey, baby! So how's the new Mr. And Mrs. Shepherd?"

  Serena
"I just did something so stupid..."

[Fast-forward.]

  Serena
"It's hot. I'm too hot."

  Man
"You are too hot."

[Serena or Georgina -- or both -- moaning; the man joins in. Serena slaps her laptop closed and hides the USB drive, then runs to the living room ... Where Lily was just heading up to find her, quite angry.]

  Lily
Where do you think you're going?

  Serena
I can't talk right now, Mom. I'll explain later.

  Lily
If you invite an old friend to our quiet family dinner, I expect you to stay and eat. (G appears) You know how I always loved when Georgina came around.

  Georgina, kissing her cheek
I ran into Lily in the lobby. You totally forgot to tell her I was coming over for dinner! Did you get my present?
DUMBO

[Jenny tries on clothes and reads about herself on GG.]

  Gossip Girl
"Breaking news! Asher Hornsby overheard bragging that Little J swiped her V card at his register."

  Dan, running in with his phone
Jenny, is this true?

  Jenny
It's private.

  Dan
It's on the internet.

  Jenny
Yeah, well, it's none of your business. And since when did you start reading Gossip Girl blasts anyway?

  Dan
Since you became the subject of them. You're fifteen years old, and I'm your big brother. It is my business.

  Jenny
Well, it's not true. You happy?

  Dan
Oh. W...

  Jenny
You can't tell anyone, though. Everyone has to believe it.

  Dan
Wha... Are you saying that you actually want your friends to think that you're sleeping with a guy who's gay?

  Jenny
Do you believe everything you read?

  Dan
I didn't read it. I saw it.

  Jenny
So you were the one who sent the tip?

  Dan
Yeah, I'm... Look, I'm sorry, but I tried to tell you. You wouldn't listen to me. I needed to get your attention somehow.

  Jenny
Well, I knew about him the whole time.

  Dan
So... So you let him use you?

  Jenny
Well, maybe I was using him. Did you ever think of that?

  Dan
I don't know which is worse.

  Jenny
For once in your life, could you just stop judging everyone?

  Dan
No, I'm not. I'm...

  Jenny
You think that you're so different and so good? Well guess what, Dan? The minute that you start sending tips to Gossip Girl, you're in the game with the rest of us. Get out of my room.
Palace

  Serena, answering phone
Hey... B, now's not a good time.

  Blair, reading about Eric in Asher's emails
It's important.

  Serena, ringing off
Look, I know I told you I'd be more available, but I just can't right now.

  Blair
But it can't wait!

  Serena, returning to dinner
Sorry. It was just Blair.

  Georgina
Oh. How is Snow White?

  Eric
Uh, Snow Not-So-White. Did you hear that she and...

  Serena
--Eric.

  Lily
So Georgina, what brings you back to New York?

  Georgina
Oh, I just had some time to kill.

  Serena
She went to boarding school in Switzerland.

  Lily
Oh, your parents must be happy you're back.

  Georgina
Oh, no. Actually, they've moved to the country full-time. I'm just in the city to catch up with some old friends. What about you? You and that gorgeous Tiffany rock seem to be the talk of the city.

  Lily
Thank you. Mr. Bass and I are very, um, happy.

  Georgina
You look it. You all do. I mean, there must be love in the New York air. You're engaged, Serena's found a new guy, Eric found himself a boyfriend...

  Eric
Excuse me?

  Georgina
Oh, I...

  Lily
I'm sorry. I don't think I heard you right.

  Georgina
What? You haven't met Serena's new guy?

  Lily
A... boyfriend?

  Georgina
Oh. You mean Eric. You didn't know he was dating someone? I... didn't think it was a secret, I mean, I saw them kissing in front of St. Jude's this morning for all the world to see...

[Eric is sad.]

  Georgina
Well, don't look so embarrassed, E, he is a hot piece! Well done.

  Serena
Please, Georgina. It's not funny, okay?

  Georgina
You... You didn't know Eric was dating a boy.

  Lily
This doesn't make any sense, because that would mean ... that Eric is... And he's not. He's just not.

[Eric looks down.]

  Lily
Are you?

[Eric tries to speak.]

  Lily
Oh God.

[Eric runs off to his bedroom to call Chuck.]

  Serena
Eric. Great, Mom. That's just great. (To Georgina) How dare you?
DUMBO

  Jenny, heading out the door
Dan went out with Vanessa, and I'm going to choir practice like we talked about. Don't wait up.

  Rufus
Not so fast. Where were you gonna change your clothes?

  Jenny
We don't wear a uniform for rehearsal.

  Rufus
Well, unless the choir is entertainment at Asher's party, you have some explaining to do.

  Jenny
How'd you know about the party?

  Rufus, pulling a dress from her bag
I know a lot more than you think I do. Nice dress.

  Jenny
I wanted one night out, okay? What was I supposed to do?

  Rufus
Ask my permission?

  Jenny
Well, you would've said no.

  Rufus
You're probably right, but that's no excuse to lie to me.

  Jenny
Dad, you don't understand. I'm throwing this party!

  Rufus
Not anymore you're not. You need to call Asher and tell him you're not coming.

  Jenny
I can't. All my friends...

  Rufus
You heard me.

  Jenny
I promised!

  Rufus
All that good behavior from the past few weeks just got wiped out from that lie.

  Jenny
You can't stop me, all right?

  Rufus
Jenny, if you walk out that door...

  Jenny
You'll what?! What, Dad? What are you gonna do? Are you gonna put bars on my window? Or chain me to the kitchen counter? I'm not your... I'm not a little girl anymore. You can't make me do anything.

  Rufus
You've already lost my trust. You really wanna lose my respect, too?

  Jenny, leaving
I'm sorry.
Eric's Room

  Eric, on the phone
Yeah. Okay.

  Serena, knocking
Hey, it's me.

  Eric
Bye.

  Serena
Who are you talking to?

  Eric
Chuck.

  Serena
What, you called Chuck?

  Eric
Yeah. I've been talking to him a lot lately. Guy's got his faults, but he's never judged me.

  Serena
I'm your sister. We're us. You can tell me anything.

  Eric
I wanted to, but it... It's not the type of thing you blurt out on the way to school. I was waiting for the right time.

  Serena
Dinner with Georgina definitely wasn't, at all. I'm sorry about her... About me. I came back for you, And then I abandoned you all over again.

  Eric
This isn't like before. I'm fine, really.

  Serena
Well, I'm here now.

  Eric
When I was at Ostroff, I met this guy. We were going through a lot of the same stuff. And now that guy is dating Jenny.

  Serena
Wait, you're the mystery guy that Asher was spotted kissing? I know this isn't how you wanted this to happen.

  Eric, awesomely
Yeah, I guess the important thing is that it's happening.

  Serena, embracing him
...I'm so proud of you. I love you, no matter what you do, who you like, whose boyfriend kisses you. The people who care about you will always stand by your side, okay?

  Eric
Yeah. I think I'm gonna drop by Asher's party. There's one more person I have to talk to.
Hornsby Residence

  Elise
Oh my God, Blair crashed Jenny's party.

  Isabel
You look...

  Blair
I know.

  Hazel
Jenny's gonna freak.

  Blair
Watch and learn, ladies. The most important parties to attend are the ones you're not invited to. Where's the host? I have something for him.
Coffeeshop

  Serena, kissing Dan
Oh, thank God you're here. I'm so happy to see you.

  Dan
Hey. I'm happy to see you, too. You can meet Sarah.

  Serena
Oh, I'd love to, but now is really not a good time.

  Dan
Well, she's here, so, uh... Sarah, Serena. Serena, Sarah.

  Georgina
Hi. I'm Sarah. It is so nice to finally meet you. (Offering her hand; Serena finally shakes it) Wow. I mean... Dan told me you were pretty, but he didn't do you justice.

  Serena
Dan, can we talk in private, please?

  Georgina
Hey, no, no, no. Wait. Don't go. Vanessa was just about to show me one of her movies. I'm a filmmaker, too, of sorts. Actually, i brought one of my short films. I was hoping to get your opinion. Maybe you wanna see it, too, and tell me what you think?

  Vanessa
I'll go get my laptop.

  Serena
Dan, would you get me a coffee? (Sharply) Please?

  Dan
...Yeah.

  Serena, alone with G
What the hell are you doing, Georgina? Put that away.

  Georgina
Aw, come on. I'm just having a little fun. Remember? Like old times. You and me pretending to be different people... Svetlana and Savannah...

  Serena
This is not a game. I don't know how you even filmed that, but I'm not playing with you this time.

  Georgina
It's just a friendly game.

  Serena
But we're not friends.

  Georgina, stroking her hair
Oh, I think we are. You see, because with me as your enemy, Dan sees this. And if the heavy petting doesn't send him running, well, I'll bet what happened after will.

  Dan, returning with V
Hey. What'd we miss?

  Serena
Nothing. It's like Sarah and I have known each other for years.

  Dan
Oh. Great.

  Serena
We don't need the laptop anymore. Thanks.

  Georgina, to V's questioning look
No, I got a little shy about showing it. Maybe next time?

  Vanessa
Okay...
Hornsby Residence

  Penelope
So was it as special as you hoped it would be?

  Hazel
Cause yours totally wasn't.

  Penelope
And yours was?

  Jenny
I mean, yeah. Asher made me feel really safe.

  Hazel
You are so lucky.

  Jenny
I know.

  Elise, appearing
You guys, Blair is here.

  Jenny
What is she doing here? She wasn't invited.
Blair, tapping Asher on the shoulder with his phone: We need to talk.

  Asher
Give us a moment, guys.

  Blair
I thought you might want this back.

  Asher
Whatever you found, it's not what it looks like.

  Blair
It's always "what it looks like." And judging by the texts and photos, it "looks like" a little more than friendship.

  Asher
What are you going to do with them?

  Blair
Well, lucky for you, your friend is someone I actually care about, or I would've used them against you and Jenny already. Too bad you don't care about him the same way.

  Eric, arriving
It's okay, Blair. I can handle this.

  Asher
What's he doing here?

  Jenny, appearing
What is she doing here?

  Eric
Are you gonna tell her, or am I?

  Asher
There's nothing to tell.

  Eric
Gossip Girl was right. Asher was kissing someone this morning. Me.

  Asher
He's totally lying. Tell him, Jenny. I was with you all morning.

  Jenny
Yeah. Asher's right. I was with him. Eric's lying.

  Eric
Why would I stand here in front of everyone we know, and tell them if it wasn't true? I'm gay. And so are you.

  Asher
Get this faggot out of here!

  Eric, sad and disgusted, leaves
Go ahead and do it.

[Blair sends all of their correspondence to Gossip Girl.]

  Asher
What did you just do?

  Blair, handing back his phone
You'll see...

[Lily drinks tea on her couch, on the phone with Rufus.]

  Lily
What kind of mother does not know that her son is gay?

  Rufus
The people you know best are the ones most capable of surprising you.

  Lily
The things that I said, the way I acted... It was not my finest maternal moment. What if he does something again?

  Rufus
I know how much you love him. So does he. You just need to remind him of that.

  Lily
But what if it's not enough?

  Rufus
Most of the time, it's all we've got.

  Lily
And what about you? What are you gonna do?

  Rufus
I'm gonna wait for my daughter to come to me... And then I'm gonna ground her until she's twenty-five.

  Lily
Ah, we make quite the team, huh?

  Rufus
Always did. ...Good luck, Lil. With everything. I'm sure you'll make a beautiful bride.

  Lily
Mm, thank you. Good night, Rufus.

  Gossip Girl
"Weekend update: A same-sex kiss hasn't caused this much controversy since Britney and Madonna. Looks like Little J didn't spread her legs after all. She spread lies instead. Asher is gay, and I have the correspondence to prove it."
Hornsby Residence

  Blair
Looks like someone needs a semester in France.

  Penelope
Get your things, girls. We're leaving.

  Jenny
Guys, we can still have fun. Don't leave.

  Hazel
It's kind of hard to party after the gay bomb drops.

  Penelope
I'm gonna do something out of character, and give you the benefit of the doubt. Tell us Gossip Girl is wrong.

  Hazel
Did you or did you not sleep with Asher?

  Jenny
I... may have exaggerated a little bit.

  Penelope
Dating a gay guy is an honest mistake, but lying to your girlfriends about s*x is unforgivable.

  Isabel
To think, I almost asked you to wear a matching dress tonight.

  Nelly Yuki
You're branded now with the L word.

  Elise
"Liar."

  Penelope
So what are we doing tonight?

  Blair
"We" are doing nothing. I, however, am going home.

  Penelope
But, um...

  Blair
Tomorrow, dinner at the Waverly and then to 151 for drinks?

  Penelope
Yeah.

  Blair
I'll have Dorota Blackberry everyone an itinerary.

  Gossip Girl
"Don't look so sad, Little J. The sun'll come out tomorrow. Even though your boyfriend did today."
Palace

  Lily, calling out to Eric
Hey, um, I made... Uh, some tea. Um, it's probably iced now, but, um... Look. My reaction earlier...

  Eric
It's okay, Mom.

  Lily
No, it's not okay. You just caught me off guard. I guess I ... I just wasn't ready.

  Eric
Well, I wasn't ready either, so... It's okay if you need time.

  Lily
Well... Since you're being so honest, I'm gonna, um, try as well, okay? I'm scared. And life is tough enough as it is, you know? I want... I want the best for you. And, um... I'm worried for your safety. And your happiness.

  Eric
I have a better chance of being happy if I'm honest.

  Lily
I know that, and I want you to know what love is. Whoever you're with. Bbecause it's pretty great.

  Eric
You would know, right? Fourth time's the charm.

  Gossip Girl
"Ah, yes, The truth always comes out. It's one of the fundamental rules of time. And when it comes out, it can set you free... Or end everything you fought so hard for."

  Blair, reading Gossip Girl as Jenny enters
My, my. If it isn't Little J, risen from the ashes.

  Jenny
I came to tell you in person. You win.

  Blair
Oh sweetie, we just started to play!

  Jenny
No, you don't understand. I'm done. With you, with them, with all of it.

  Blair
Just like that, you wave the white flag?

  Jenny
I lied, and I stole, and I lost the respect of my family... for what? So I can be like you? You asked me before if it was all worth it. My answer is, it's not.

  Blair
I tried to warn you... There's a price to pay. I always knew a girl like you couldn't afford it.

  Jenny
Well, you were right.

  Blair
Well, you put up a good fight... For a freshman.

  Jenny
Thanks.

  Blair
I hope you don't expect a hug.

  Jenny
I don't expect anything anymore.

[She leaves, totally defeated; Blair is sad for her.]
Outside coffeeshop

  Dan
So she's great, right? What do you think?

  Serena
Honestly, there's something I don't really like about her.

  Dan
Okay, but you had your doubts about Vanessa in the beginning, and now you guys are friends...

  Serena
This is different.

  Dan
I don't understand why you... You're...

  Serena
Why I'm what?

  Dan
Jealous. There's no reason to be. She, she actually wanted us to patch things up.

  Serena
What, you told her about our problems?

  Dan
Yes, because she wanted to listen to them, and she had good advice, too.

  Serena
Look at me. I love you, okay? You just have to take my word for it. Do not trust her.

  Dan
But you just met her. I... You know, you've been hanging out with Chuck, and you've been partying, and avoiding me, and lying, and you're trying to tell me who I can and cannot trust? I-I don't understand that at all. You know, we... We all live in Brooklyn, so... I don't know. If you need to catch a cab, I think you should do that here.

  Serena
Dan, don't. I want to talk.

  Dan
Then talk!

  Vanessa
I'm gonna get going...

  Dan
Hey, just hold on. One... One second.

  Georgina
I forgot something inside. I'll catch up with you guys? (Dan and V walk away, Georgina runs up to Serena) Well, I had fun. How about you?

  Serena
What do you want from me?

  Georgina
I want things to go back to how they were before that night, before things got so screwed up. We were such good friends, and now we can be again.

  Serena
Why would I want to be friends with somebody who blackmails me? Who outs my little brother at the dinner table?

  Georgina
Eric was an honest mistake. I would never hurt him.

  Serena
No, I don't believe you. I don't believe you about Eric, about anything.

  Georgina
Maybe you're right. Maybe I did it on purpose. Because I can, because I know things about you, about your family, about your boyfriend, and I know them before you do. Oh look, cab. (Scary) You get home safe. (Catches up with V and Lonelyboy) Hold up, guys! I'm coming.
DUMBO

  Gossip Girl
"Another way the truth comes out: When you don't even mean it to..."

  Rufus, reading Dan's Scrabble words
"Angry, Change, Trust, Girl." Somethin' you wanna talk about?

  Dan
Who would have thought Scrabble could be so therapeutic? That last one was a triple word score...

  Gossip Girl, as Jenny enters
"Or when, without saying a word, it's still loud and clear."

  Jenny
Dad? Do you think it'd be okay if I joined you?

  Rufus
You know there's always room for you here.

  Dan
Yeah, and Dad's totally losing, so he could use your help.

  Jenny, curling up in his arms
Dad, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about everything.
Waldorf House

  Gossip Girl, as Serena enters looking rough
"But the worst thing the truth can do is, when you finally tell it, it doesn't set you free, but locks you away forever."

  Serena
...Blair?

  Blair
Serena, what are you doing here? It's late. Oh my God, what happened? What's wrong? Talk to me.

  Serena
I can't.

  Blair
Of course you can.

  Serena
No. No, B, this is the one thing I can't tell you. I can't tell anyone.

  Blair
I'm not "anyone," I'm me. You can tell me anything.

  Serena
No, I can't. Because then that'd make you a part of it, and you can't be a part of this.

  Blair
What are you talking about? You're starting to scare me. Hey, hey, hey. We're sisters. You're my family. What is you, is me. There's nothing that you could ever say to make me let go. I love you. What is it?

  Serena
I killed someone


      PREVIOUSLY

  Rufus
You're one of my oldest friends.

  Lily
That's certainly not how it felt when you kissed me at Eleanor's.

  Lily
He proposed before we left, and I'm going to say yes.

  Rufus
I'm sure you'll make a beautiful bride.

  Vanessa, to Nate
Last night was strange, but very fun... Didn't we just say good-bye?

  Nate
Somehow, you screwing Blair for sport is my fault!

  Chuck
All right, I know how long you and I have been best friends, okay?

  Nate
No, it's not okay. From now on, you stay away from me.

  Serena
Georgina. What are you doing here?

  Georgina
I told you I was coming.

  Serena, to Chuck
Dan of all people cannot know Georgie.

  Dan
How about, um, dinner tonight with Sarah instead?

  Serena
Oh, Sarah again. What is she, your new girlfriend or something?

  Dan
She's new in town, and she does want to meet you.

  Georgina, to Serena
I'm Sarah.

  Serena
What do you want from me?

  Georgina
I want things to go back to how they were before that night, before things got so screwed up.

  Chuck
What's Georgina got on you? What's so bad you can't even tell me?

  Georgina, on video
"If you put the camera over there, she'll never know."

  Blair
You can tell me anything.

  Serena
I killed someone.

  Gossip Girl
"And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell. You know you love me. XOXO, Gossip Girl."

      END OF EPISODE

ACT ONE

[G walks through Manhattan, making call after call.]

  Gossip Girl
"In our modern age, when you can call someone and can't find them, you can pretty much be sure they'll get the message."

  Georgina
Hey S, it's Georgie. Listen, I know it's early, but I thought I'd ... So this is my third call. Where are you? ...It's me again. I've left you a couple messages, and you haven't called me back... I think we should hang out today. Friends hang out... Maybe you've lost your cell phone. Can't wait to see you...

  Gossip Girl
"But if they don't call you back, it usually means they don't want to be found."

[Humphrey Loft: Rufus strums his guitar as Lonelyboy enters.]

  Rufus
Hey, do you think "Track Me Down" should come before or after "Everytime"?

  Dan
Is the Rolling Stone thing tonight?

  Rufus
I guess I really am in one of the Top Ten Forgotten Bands of the '90s...

  Dan
It's true. I forgot.

  Rufus
Yeah, but a lot of people remember. There's a reason that issue was one of the highest selling of the year.

  Dan
And I'm proud, Dad, I really am. You got your follow-up article and a concert, surely followed by an overpriced CD sold at corporate coffeehouses for Gen Xers without taste buds or taste.

  Rufus
Hey, it's gonna be cool. I mean, they're even filming it for vh1.

  Dan
vh1 Classics. The "classic" is kind of important.

  Rufus
I'm classic! Uh-oh, no retort. Signs of a sleepless night. Disinterest in making your father feel old and irrelevant... That can only mean one thing. Girl trouble.

  Dan
Yeah, Serena and I, we had a fight last night. This new kind we keep having where she says something, and I know it's not the whole truth.

  Rufus
Well, have you asked her what's really on her mind?

  Dan
Only about ten thousand times, yeah.

  Rufus
Yeah, but did you really mean it? Most times, when people don't offer the truth, it's because they're afraid of what someone might think. And I don't know if you know this, but you can be a pretty judgmental guy.

  Dan
So you're saying that I should learn to be someone else around her so she can be herself around me?

  Rufus
Couldn't have said it better myself.

  Dan
Thank you, Dad. I'm gonna go find her right now.

  Rufus
See you tonight... Both of you.

[N surprises V outside the Coffeeshop]

  Nate
And here I thought I had your schedule memorized.

  Vanessa
I switched shifts and just got off. I'm Dan's Dad's roadie for the day, so I gotta bail in like five. Um, although I don't mind the stalking... When are you gonna ask me on a real date?

  Nate, answering his phone
Uh... Hold that thought. Sorry. Hello? Yeah. Yeah, okay, I'll be right there. Look, I'm sorry. I gotta go...

  Vanessa
So I heard.

  Nate
No, no, no. It's not what you think. It's just... What are you doing tonight?

  Vanessa
Uh, me, Lincoln Hawk, a dirty van and a lot of cables?

  Nate
Can I meet you at the concert?

  Vanessa
Can you be there at 7:30?

  Nate
It's a date.

  Vanessa
Finally!

  Nate
Text me the address.

[Palace Hotel: Bass Suite]

  Planner
The guests will be checked into their suites as soon as they arrive. The walk-through is at two, and the rehearsal dinner starts promptly at seven PM in the Reid salon. Oh, and don't forget. You have your interview with Rolling Stone in one hour.

  Bart
The interview. How could we forget?

  Dan
Hey, uh, excuse me, Mr. Bass, Ms. Van der Woodsen.

  Lily
Not for long, thank you very much.

  Bart
Morning, Daniel.

  Dan
Morning. Good morning. Have either of you seen Serena? She's not upstairs.

  Planner
Uh, ticktock, ticktock, ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

  Lily
No, Dan. Sorry.

  Dan
Okay. ...And her bed hasn't been slept in...

  Chuck, entering
Well, I knew housekeeping was hiring, but I had no idea their standards were so low.

  Dan
I hate that I have to ask you this, but have you seen Serena?

  Chuck
Oh, I've seen lots of Serena.

[B calls him.]

  Chuck, shutting a door in Dan's face
Are you drunk dialing again? ...No, Serena didn't come home last night. I thought she was with you.

[N boards the elevator at B's house; C enters at the last second.]

  Nate
Hey.

  Chuck
Hey.

[Awkward. When they enter the residence, it's empty.]

  Chuck
Maybe this is Blair's idea of a perverse double date.

  Dorota
Miss Blair asks that you should wait there. She's on her way now.

  Nate
She's not even here?

  Chuck, sitting
Well, this oughta be good.

[G carries coffee toward the Palace.]

  Georgina
You're not calling me back, and you're not picking up. I thought you understood me, but maybe I should make myself a little more clear and come to you. We can talk about it over coffee. I brought it just the way you like it...dark but sweet.

  Georgina, spotting Dan in the courtyard
Oh, no...

  Dan
Hey, Sarah!

  Georgina, fake-laughing
Dan! Hey! Oh, my gosh! What a coincidence.

  Dan
Yeah. What ... what are you doing here?

  Georgina
Oh, um, I actually have an old friend from Portland staying here.

  Dan
Oh, okay.

  Georgina
What are you doing here?

  Dan
Oh, I just... I came looking for Serena, but she, uh, apparently didn't come home last night, so I'm just... I don't know. I'm trying to figure out what to think. She's been... Well, let's just say she's not been herself lately. So I... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what to do exactly.

  Georgina
Why don't you try giving her a call again? And when she sees it's you calling, she'll immediately pick up and tell you all about it.

[Lonelyboy's phone rings.]

  Dan, showing G and answering
Hey. Hey, I've been looking all over for you!

  Drew
Hey, is this Dan?

  Dan
Who's this?

  Drew
My name's Drew. I'm the bartender at 1OAK. Some girl left this phone here last night, it's been ringing off the hook all morning. You were the first number on the speed dial...

  Dan
"Some girl"? What... What girl?

  Drew
Tall, blonde, left here around two with three guys. Skipped out on her tab, which was pretty substan...

[Lonelyboy hangs up.]

  Georgina
Hey. What is it?
Gossip Girl:"Spotted: Lonelyboy on the Upper East Side, learning the lesson that nothing stays missing for long..."

  Dan
It's nothing. Nothing.

[B enters the Waldorf residence.]

  Gossip Girl
"...Things always turn up, for better..."

  Nate
Well, is something actually wrong, or is this just some ploy to get us both here?

  Blair
I meant what I said on the phone. I need your help. We need your help.

[B leads them back to the elevator: S is in a total shambles on the floor.]

  Gossip Girl
"...Or for worse."

  Nate
Oh my God. You okay? ... What's wrong with her?

  Blair
Take her upstairs, get her upstairs. Dorota! Coffee. Fast.


      ACT TWO

[B carries S to her bathroom.]

  Blair
Come on, Serena. We have to get her in the shower.

  Serena
No, I just want to sleep.

  Blair
Here. No. Come on, come on.

  Serena
Why won't you let me sleep?

  Blair
We have to keep her talking and awake. Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go. Dorota, will you please get her a fresh change of clothes and a bathrobe?

  Dorota
Of course, Miss Blair.

  Chuck, entering with shopping bags
So we have every hangover cure known to man, plus bagels. They should help soak up the alcohol and whatever else she took...

  Blair
Thank you, I'll take it from here. Come on. Come on. Come on, Serena. Help me out.

[C watches B undress S; N closes the door on the girls.]

  Serena
B, it's cold! It's cold!

  Chuck
Just like old times.

  Nate
You know, why do I get the feeling you're actually enjoying this?

[S barfs loudly inside the bathroom.]

  Chuck
Call me sentimental?

  Blair
Ugh. I may not need those bagels after all.

  Nate
What's going on with her?

  Blair
She was here last night, scared. She... She told me something totally crazy, but was too freaked out to find the words to explain it. I went upstairs to find my mom's Valium to calm her down, but when I got back, she was gone. It took me all night to find her.

  Chuck
What exactly did she say to you?

  Blair
That's ... beside the point. We're here to help Serena, no matter what the problem is.

[While V and Rufus unload the van, another guy is reading the Post, headline "BEAUTY BAGS BASS," with a picture of Lily.]

  Rufus
Hey, could you maybe read that somewhere else? ...I don't like the Post.

  Vanessa
Is that why you subscribe?

  Rufus
Another thing I don't like... My son, depressed. I don't know if you've talked to him recently...

  Vanessa
We've talked.

  Rufus
He and Serena... Should I be worried?

  Vanessa
It's been a little bumpy lately, sure. I think the most recent bump is our friend Sarah. Serena's a little jealous, but Sarah's cool, so as soon as Serena gets to know her, everything will be fine.

[A giant poster of Rufus unfurls down the building.]

  Vanessa
I love that picture of you!

  Rufus
Yeah. Me too...

[At the Palace, the Rolling Stone reporter takes out the same picture.]

  Reporter
Tell me where you took this photograph, what undoubtedly could be called the band's most well-known image?

  Lily
Uh, well, I wouldn't go that far.

  Reporter
Well, I would. It's positively iconic. Were you and Rufus Humphrey already involved when you took it?

  Lily
Excuse me?

  Reporter
Rufus Humphrey, lead singer of Lincoln Hawk? Or... Was this before or after...?

  Lily
Oh, well, I simply don't feel comfortable discussing anything other than my work.

  Reporter
I was talking about your work. Why'd you give up photography? Was it too hard to continue shooting after you had broken his heart?

[There's a knock at the door.]

  Lily
Um, just -- just a moment, please.

  Dan, at the door
Oh. You know, I see I'm interrupting, so I'll ...

  Lily
No, I have to say I have ... never been happier to see you, Dan.

  Dan
Oh. Well, I've been waiting downstairs for Serena. I... I figured she has to come home... Sometime soon. So have you heard from her?

  Lily
Have you tried calling?

  Dan
Pretty sure she lost her phone.

  Lily
Well, Charles said he was going over to Blair's to pick her up right after you left earlier. Maybe try there?

  Dan
Ah, yes. "Charles." Charles, of course. Thank you so much.

  Lily, returning to reporter
Listen, I really appreciate your coming all the way to the Palace to conduct this interview, but I'm simply going to have to ask you to leave, because I have a wedding to attend. My own.

  Reporter
Do you think you were able to take such incredible photos of Rufus Humphrey because of how much you were in love with him?

  Lily
Well, I wasn't in love with him. Um... That much.

  Reporter
Thank you for your time.

  Lily
Mm.

[B barely spares Lonelyboy a glance as he enters the Waldorf house.]

  Blair
Dorota, can you bring the towels upstairs?

  Nate, coming downstairs
What's taking so long?

  Dan
Huh. Guess I missed a chapter...

[C enters, with a platter of bagels.]

  Dan
Or ... four. Don't, ah, don't all of you hate each other?

  Blair
Yes.

  Nate
Absolutely.

  Chuck
No.

  Dan
Well, that's fascinating and ripe for a psychiatrist's case study somewhere but, um, I am looking for Serena.

  Chuck
She's not here.

  Dan
I think she is.

  Blair
No, she just left. You must've crossed paths.

  Dan
I... I don't believe you.

  Blair, worried
Fine. I... I didn't want to have to tell you this, but...she doesn't want to see you.

  Dan
Come on. Really?

  Blair
Yes. Really.

  Dan, heading for the stairs
Serena!

  Nate
She's telling the truth.

  Dan
Are you really gonna stop me from seeing my girlfriend?

[Dan tries to get past them.]

  Chuck
Whoa, man.

  Dan
Come on.

  Serena, on the stairs
What are you doing?

  Blair
S?

  Serena
It's okay.

[S leads him aside.]

  Dan, nearly crying
What's happening?

  Serena
Dan...

  Dan
Something is going on, and I just want to be let in on what it is.

  Serena
It's hard to explain...

  Dan
Well... Why don't I make it easy for you? I know you're keeping something from me, and I'm sick of being the only one you don't talk to about it.

  Serena
I'm not talking to anyone.

  Dan
Then what are they doing here, while... While I get a call from a bartender who says you left a bar at two in morning with a bunch of guys? What guys, Serena? Who... Who were they?

  Serena, mumbling
I don't know.

  Dan
Did something happen last night?

  Serena
Please don't...

  Dan
Is that... Is that what you're so afraid to tell me? That you cheated on me? Did you cheat on me last night? All I need is a yes or a no, did you sleep with someone else?

  Serena, without looking at him
Yes. Yeah.

  Dan
I'm done. I'm done.

[Lonelyboy gets on the elevator, and "Sarah" calls.]

  Dan
...Hey.

  Georgina
Hey! Did you find Serena?

  Dan
Yeah, but I ... I, uh, kinda wish I hadn't.

  Georgina
That doesn't sound so good. I'm just in the park. Wanna meet me? Maybe talk about it. I'm a pretty good listener. Dan?

  Dan
Yeah. Yeah, I'd, uh... I'd like that.

[Lily leaves the Palace with Bart and the wedding planner.]

  Lily
...Well I wanted cymbidiums, not hyacinth, and why did we choose fish? It's unseasonably warm. You know, I knew we should've gone with the Limoges instead of the Lenox...

  Bart
What's the matter? You were fine this morning. Now you're finding fault with everything.

  Lily
Nothing. Nothing at all. I'm just... I've had three perfect weddings, and I want this one to be more perfect than perfect, that's all.

[Lily's phone rings, from the Waldorf house.]

  Lily
Oh, finally. So why are you still at Blair's? You're supposed to be here.

  Dorota
Ms. van der Woodsen, it is Dorota. Miss Waldorf's...

  Lily
-- I know who you are, Dorota, but this is not a very good time.

  Dorota
Oh, the wedding, I know. Miss Serena is here.

  Lily
Oh yes, I know. I've heard several times today.

  Dorota
I know it's not my place, but... Miss Serena is... Like the old days.

  Lily
What are you trying to say?

  Dorota
I think you should have worry about your daughter. Worry like before she went away.

  Lily
Well, um... Thank you, Dorota. I'll take care of it.

[She hangs up.]

  Lily
I am so sorry, but I'm gonna have to go.

  Bart
Where do you have to go?

  Lily
To do something I've done too many times before.

  Bart
Can I help you?

  Lily
No. Thank you. I'll have to do it alone. Mwah.

[Lily searches S's room; she finds the USB drive and G's note.]

[S sits on the stairs at B's house.]

  Serena
...I can't believe I just did that.

  Nate
Then why did you? I mean, did you cheat on Dan?

  Serena
No. I remember last night. I didn't do anything.

  Blair
Then why would you say that to him?

  Serena
Because I would rather Dan think I cheated on him than know what I really did.

  Nate
What you really did?

  Serena
Dan puts me on a pedestal. If he knew the truth, he would never look at me again.

  Chuck
You're starting to scare even me. What did you do?

  Nate
Come on. You can tell us.

  Blair
We've seen you with vomit in your hair, making out with investment bankers in the men's room at PJ Clarke's. You don't have to hide anything from us.

  Nate
She's right, Serena. I mean, none of us are saints.

  Blair
Yeah, I had s*x with him in the back of a limo.

  Chuck
Several times.

  Nate
I had s*x with you at a wedding while I was her date. Once.

  Chuck
I'm Chuck Bass.

  Blair
You can tell us anything. We don't judge. We're the non-judging Breakfast Club. We're your best friends. Anything you do is something we did, too.

  Serena
If I tell you, it can never leave this room.


      ACT THREE

[Later, in B's sitting room.]

  Serena
You all know Georgina Sparks.

  Blair
Some of us better than others. (To Chuck) It's not like you didn't lose your virginity to her in seventh grade.

  Chuck
Sixth, actually, and I've been avoiding her ever since. The bitch is a psycho.

  Nate
What about her?

  Serena
Well, something happened the night of the Shepherd wedding.

  Blair
I think we're all aware of what happened that night.

  Serena
No, something else, something I've tried to escape, but Georgina won't let me. And now she's blackmailing me.

  Nate
Blackmailing you?

  Chuck
With what exactly?

  Serena
Well... It started when Blair thought you and I had too much to drink. She told us to go outside, get some air, sober up.

[Serena, dancing on the bar in a flashback: "Oh, if the happy couple didn't want to put up the cash for the premium bar, they should've made their wedding BYOB..."]

  Serena, over their hookup
Instead, we went into the empty bar, I opened the bottle of champagne, and we... Well...

  Blair, cutting into the flashback
We can skip that part, okay?

  Chuck
Go ahead. I'll fill her in later.

  Serena
I left in a hurry. I felt so terrible, so guilty for what I had just done. I just... I had to get out of there.

[Serena catches a cab in Nate's tuxedo shirt: "Eastview Hotel, please."]

  Serena
Georgina and I had plans to meet up after, so I headed straight to her. Little did I know she had a surprise waiting for me...

[Lily watches the tape on S's laptop.]

  Georgina, on the tape
"She's gonna lose her mind. A genuine Serena van der Woodsen s*x tape..."

  Pete
"How are we gonna do this, exactly?"

  Georgina
"Well, if you put the camera over there, she'll never know."

  Pete
"Are you sure she's gonna be down for this?"

  Georgina
"It's Serena, she goes down for anything."

[They make out, S enters.]

  Georgina
"Hey, baby. How are the new Mr. and Mrs. Shepherd?"

  Serena
I didn't know it at the time, but she was taping me. Lucky for me, I was... I was too stuck on what had just happened to be much fun for anyone.

  Serena, in video/flashback
"I can't believe I just did that. Blair's my best friend. What... What sort of person does that to her best friend?"

  Pete
"All right, this is a therapy session, G. You promised a party."

  Georgina
"So break out the favors!"

  Pete
"Jing!"

  Georgina
"Thank you."

  Serena, running to the bathroom
"Oh. I don't... I don't feel so good..."

  Georgina
"She always gets frisky after she hurls."

[Lily fast-forwards the tape. Pete is mauling Serena.]

  Serena
"No, Pete. I'm not in the mood, okay?"

  Pete
"Come on..."

  Serena
"I'm hot, okay? I'm... I'm too hot."

  Pete
"Oh, you are too hot."

  Serena
"No, it's... It's hot. Why is it so hot in here?"

[She tugs on the tuxedo shirt and he helps her off with it; she's wearing a camisole underneath. He kisses her neck, and she eventually kisses back. Lily slams the computer closed.]

  Blair
What is it?

  Serena
I can't.

  Blair
Yes. Yes, you can.

  Serena, crying
I'm scared.

  Blair
We're right here.

  Serena, in flashback
"No. You know, I can't. I can't. I can't do this, Pete. Okay? I can't. Um... Yeah, how about, um...how about we do a couple lines first, okay?"

  Pete
"Whatever, baby."

  Serena
"Here. Go ahead."

[Pete snorts a line, then starts moaning and convulsing.]

  Serena
"Pete? Pete, are you okay? Pete, what's happening? Are you okay? ...Georgie. Georgie! Georgina!"

  Georgina, entering
"What? Why are you screaming? What are you doing?"

  Serena
"I'm calling 911!"

  Georgina
"You -- You can't! There's drugs everywhere, we could get in so much trouble. We can get arrested. We have to go."

  Serena
"No! We can't leave him!"

  Georgina
"We have to. Get everything out that has you on it. Go."

  Serena
"Oh my God, oh my God. Oh, my God. Where's his phone? Where's his phone?"

  Georgina
"What are you doing?"

  Serena
"I'm calling!"
911: "Hello, 911 emergency."

  Serena
"Hi, uh, we have an emergency, can you send someone right away to the Eastview Hotel? Room, uh, 1411. Please. There's a guy, he's having seizures. I don't know what's wrong."

  Georgina
"Get off the phone! We have to go!"
911: "Ma'am, I'm gonna need your name and... Hello? Hello, ma'am? Are you there?

  Serena
So Georgina told me we had to split up. Then she said that people might be looking for us, but I... I couldn't go, I just couldn't. So I waited near the hotel, across the street. All I wanted was to see the paramedics helping Pete. But that's not what I saw.

[They carry Pete out on a gurney, in a body bag.]

  Serena
I didn't know what to do. I... I just knew I had to leave right away. I took a train heading north, and I got a room and convinced my mom that boarding school was a good idea, and...

  Blair
Never said good-bye. It makes sense now.

  Nate
But what does she even want from you?

  Serena
Well, when she came back, I... I told her that I moved on from the lifestyle that she was still in, but she didn't like that. So somehow, she became friends with Dan and ... and Vanessa and called herself "Sarah."

  Blair
Why don't you just tell Dan about her?

  Serena
Because she has that tape of me, and she'll use it. It's practically a snuff film.

  Chuck
We need to find her.

  Serena
No. Please. Promise me, please. Promise me you won't do anything. Because if you do, then she'll show Dan. ...If he even ever speaks to me again.

  Gossip Girl
"Watch out, S. Just because you finally tell the truth doesn't mean there won't be consequences."

  Serena
God, what have I done?


      ACT FOUR

[At the rehearsal dinner for Bart and Lily's wedding. Bart greets guests while Lily discusses things with the wedding planner.]

  Bart, kissing a guest
Sylvia. How are you?

  Sylvia
I'm wonderful.

  Bart
Good to see you again.

  Sylvia
So good to see you, too.

[S enters, with C and B.]

  Serena
Thanks for coming with me, B. I'm really not feeling up to being social.

  Blair
Of course.

  Lily, spotting her
Oh. Excuse me.

  Chuck
Incoming...

  Lily, taking her aside
You were supposed to be home hours ago. Come with me.

  Serena
I'm ... I'm sorry, Mom. And you look beautiful. I hope you don't mind I asked Blair to come tonight...

  Lily
What happened to you last night? Why didn't you come home? Why was Dan looking for you all morning? And why did I get a call informing me that you were on drugs?

  Serena
I wasn't on drugs...

  Lily
Don't lie to me. I saw that little home movie that you and your friends made.

  Serena
You... You watched that?

  Lily
Well, only part of it. I stopped when that guy had his tongue down your throat. But I can pretty much guess how it ends.

  Serena
No, it... It was just a joke! We were kidding, it's not what it looked like...

  Lily
You know what? You are out of control. I always knew you had a wild side, but how can you look at yourself? What have you become? I thought we were past all of this, Serena. I thought you were doing so well. I have nothing left but to send you to reformatory school. What do you think about that?

  Blair, as Lily storms off
What's wrong? What happened?

[S cries on her shoulder.]

[Vanessa gets everything ready for Rufus's show in Queens while he chats with Lisa Loeb.]

  Vanessa, handing him a guitar
Hey, guys. Sorry to interrupt. Tuned to F#m, and Lisa, Sheckman told me to tell you you're almost up.

  Lisa Loeb
Okay. Thanks.

  Rufus
Thanks, Vanessa.

  Dan, entering
Hey.

  Rufus
Hey!

  Dan
This is incredible, Dad! I hope you're sufficiently nervous, because there's like a hundred people out there. Which is 80 more than the last time you played, I think...

  Rufus
Lisa, this is my sarcastic son Dan and his friend Sarah.

  Lisa Loeb
Hey. Nice to meet you.

  Dan
Pleasure.

  Georgina
Nice to meet you.

  Lisa Loeb,bouncing
I'll see y'all later.

  Rufus
Okay. (Turning to Dan) Yeah. Ah, no Serena?

  Georgina
I'll take good care of him, Mr. Humphrey. Promise.

  Dan
Jenny's already called me about fifteen times from Mom's to make sure that I call her during "Something Like That" so she can hear you mess up the bridge. So break a leg. I'll be in the front row.

  Rufus
Okay, okay.

[Random girl in the audience spots G, scaring her.]

  Girl
Hey, Georgina! Georgina...

  Dan
Uh, I think she thinks she knows you.

  Georgina
I've never seen her before in my life. Um, let's go get a drink.

[B interrupts Lily's conversation at the rehearsal dinner.]

  Blair
-- Don't send her away.

  Lily
Blair, it's... It's, uh, not polite to interrupt.

  Blair
I don't care who hears. Just don't send her away.

  Lily, taking her aside
Excuse me. Thank you, Blair, but it's not exactly your business what I do with my daughter. If anything, you're one of the reasons I'm having to take such strong actions.

  Blair
I say this with all due respect, Lily, but you have no idea what your daughter's been going through. She's in a lot of pain, and I don't think the pain's gonna go away if she goes away.

  Lily
I don't understand what you're trying to tell me.

  Blair
Serena has a secret, and she's been holding on to it for a long, long time. And now it's finally catching up with her. I... I'm out of my league here. I can't do any more than I've done, and it's not enough. She needs you.

  Lily
I saw the video. She doesn't need me. She needs boundaries.

  Blair
What you saw isn't the whole story.

[N calls V at the show.]

  Nate
Hey V, it's me.

  Vanessa
You're not calling to cancel, are you? Because waiting twenty minutes before the concert maybe isn't the best way to let a girl down.

  Nate
No, I'm calling to let you know I may be ten minutes late because -- drumroll, please -- I'm actually gonna take the subway to the show.

  Vanessa
Subway, huh? Nate Archibald, man of the people!

  Nate
Oh, well, thank you.

  Vanessa
Uh, and your name's on the list, but if you don't see me, just look for Dan and our friend Sarah. They'll know where I am.

  Nate
Wait, Sarah's there? With Dan?

  Vanessa
As strange as it may seem, Dan is here. It is his dad's gig.

  Nate
No, no, no. I'm not talking about Dan. I'm talking about Sarah.

  Vanessa
Okay, now you're totally weirding me out.

  Nate
Sarah is not her real name. It's Georgina. Serena just told us this really messed up story about her. Just do not trust anything she says, please.

  Vanessa
Wh... What are you talking about?

  Nate
Listen, I'll tell you what I can when I get there, okay?

  Vanessa
Okay?

  Nate
Okay. I'll see you soon.

[Chuck discreetly hands Lily a slip of paper.]

  Chuck
Excuse me. Here's the address you asked for.

  Lily
Thank you, Charles. Um, excuse us...

  Blair, answering her phone
Hello?

  Nate
Hey, I only have a second. I'm on my way to Queens.

  Blair
Ugh. Gross. Why?

  Nate
To meet Vanessa at a concert.

  Blair
It got grosser.

  Nate
We've been hanging out. Not that I owe you any explanation, but I do feel like I should tell you Apparently, Georgina's with her and Dan.

  Blair
She -- She's there?

  Nate
Yeah. And you know Serena doesn't want us to do anything, but I just thought you might want to know.

  Blair
Where are you right now?

  Nate
Uh ... 74th and Lex.

  Blair
Don't move. Pick you up in ten.

  Lily
I have to go handle this thing with Serena.

  Bart
Now?

  Lily
Yes, now.

  Bart
It's our rehearsal dinner. And you're the bride.

  Lily
I know, but I'm also a mother, and ... that's more important.

  Blair
So your problems are my problems, let me come and help.

  Lily
I can't. I, uh... I wish I could explain.

  Blair
There seems to be a lot lately that you can't explain.

  Lily, kissing his cheek
I'm sorry. But this is between me and my daughter.

[As Lily leaves, C notices B grinning evilly.]

  Chuck
What's gotten into you?

  Blair
What if I told you I knew where Georgina Sparks was right now?

  Chuck
I'd say let's get the bitch.
Gossip Girl:"Spotted: Blair and Chuck, reunited to defend Serena's honor. With friends like these, who needs armies?"


      ACT FIVE

[Lily and S pull up outside a strange house.]

  Serena
So where are we?

  Lily
It's the Fairman's house. This is where the boy who died grew up, and his parents are expecting you.

  Serena
Mom, I can't go in there.

  Lily
Sweetie... If I've learned anything in life, it is that sometimes things get in your path, and you have a choice. You can either smash right into them, or you can adjust and move around, but you have to do one or the other in order to move forward.

  Serena
How can I do this?

  Lily
I'm gonna be right by your side.

[G runs into V as Lisa Loeb takes the stage.]

  MC
Ladies and gentlemen, how about a round of applause for Lisa Loeb?

  Lisa Loeb
Hey, everyone. How you doing? I'm Lisa Loeb, and I'm your host for tonight, and I am so happy you're all here. Thanks so much for coming.

  Georgina
Hey, V. I didn't realize you'd be able to hang during the concert.

  Vanessa
Do you have something you want to say to me?

  Georgina
Not that I know of...

  Vanessa
You sure about that, Georgina? My friend says Serena told him some story about you, and he's on his way to fill me in. Unless you want to do that first?

  Georgina
I don't know what you're talking about.

  Vanessa
I'm not a big fan of liars, and neither is Dan. I'm giving you a chance to explain yourself here.

  Dan, as G stomps off
Where's Sarah going?

  Vanessa
I don't know who she is. Nate just called me and said her name is Georgina.

  Dan
That's what that girl... That's what that girl back there called her. Why would she lie about her name?

  Vanessa
I think there's some other stuff, too...

  Roadie
Vanessa, Rufus can't find the set list. Do you know where it is?

  Vanessa
I taped it into the top of his Gibson case, uh... I'll get it. This will just take two minutes, just don't go anywhere. Stay right here. I'll be right back.

[Dan immediately wanders away.]

[Lily and S leave the Fairman house.]

  Lily
You okay?

  Serena
No. No, I feel terrible, Mom.

  Lily
Oh, you heard what they said. Look, Peter was an addict for ten years. His own parents couldn't get him to stop using, there's no way that a sixteen-year-old girl could have. They don't hold you responsible. You don't need to blame yourself...

  Serena
-- But I am responsible, Mom. I'm the one that gave him the line that killed him.

  Lily
Serena, those were his drugs, okay? If you hadn't given them to him, he would have taken them himself.

  Serena
Then why do I still feel like this?

  Lily
Because contrary to what I might have said earlier, you are a good person who, since that night, has been living your life with care and compassion and respect for yourself and for others. I'm sorry I doubted you.

  Serena, hugging her
Thank you. There's something else i have to do. Will you help me?

  Lily
Absolutely.

  Serena
Take me to see Dan.

[Lisa Loeb sings "Stay" while G lies some more.]

  Dan
Okay, so your name is really Georgina. Well, I don't understand why you felt like you had to lie to us.

  Georgina
Because... My boyfriend -- well, my ex-boyfriend -- when we broke up, he wasn't too happy about it, and things got out of control.

  Dan
Okay, well, what happened?

  Georgina
I came home one day, and... My car was broken into, and then a week later, my room was trashed, and I got really scared. I changed all my numbers, I moved in with a friend, and yet he still tracked me down. It was my Mom's idea to change my name and move out of town. I hate being away from my family, but... It's better than getting hurt, right?

  Dan
Yeah, right.

  Georgina
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I just... I wasn't supposed to tell anybody.

  Dan
No, no, no. No. No. I get that. I get it.

  Georgina
And I also didn't want you to think less of me, because I haven't wanted to admit it, but, um... From the moment that I met you, I've been falling for you. Oh my God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't... I don't know what I'm saying...

  Dan, over the cheers for Lisa Loeb
You know, um, you know, it's really loud here. Do you wanna go somewhere else, someplace quiet we can talk?

  Georgina
But your Dad's about to go on...

  Dan, leading her away
He'll understand. It's not like we won't be watching this on YouTube for the next five years.


      ACT SIX

[Rufus sings a catchy song whose lyrics are one line -- "Everytime you walk away or run away you take a piece of me with you there" -- over and over, approximately a million times. N, C and Queen B enter the show.]

  Vanessa, spotting Nate
Hmm. Some date we've got here. You even brought your friends... The ones I can't stand.

  Blair
Where's Georgina?

  Nate
What are you gonna do? You heard what Serena said.

  Chuck
Yeah, like we care.

  Vanessa
Georgina left.

  Blair
Left for where?

  Vanessa
I don't know, she just took off. If I could only find Dan... He's around here somewhere...

  Nate
Well, let's go look for him. Alone.

[They leave; S enters and she and B spot each other.]

  Blair
Hey, what are you doing here?

  Serena
Hey, what are you doing here?

  Blair
I... I'm a big Leaky Hawk fan?

  Serena
...I'm looking for Dan and Georgina.

  Chuck
You're out of luck. Georgina's gone.

  Serena
And Dan?

  Chuck
I'm out of luck. He's still around.

  Serena, smiling and holding B's hands
It's all over now. I can finally tell Dan everything. Will you help me find him?

[They leave Chuck alone; Lily dials Bart but hangs up when she hears Rufus singing that song over and over. She watches him sing and he smiles at her. She leaves while he's still playing, and he ends the song.]

  Lisa Loeb
All right. Everybody, that was Lincoln Hawk. Let's hear it! Let's hear an encore from Rufus and the band. The...

  Rufus, pushing past her and running away
Excuse me...

[Outside, he stands between Lily and her car.]

  Lily
Get out of my way, Rufus.

  Rufus
No.

  Lily
Get out of my way.

  Rufus
No.

[Lily finally kisses him.]

[B and C are following S into the stands when B's phone rings: HUMPHREY CALLING.]

  Blair, passing her the phone
Hey, psst. I think it's for you.

  Serena
Hey! Thank God you called, I'm here looking for you right now. Where are you?

  Georgina
With me.

  Serena
Georgina?

  Georgina
I hear you told our little secret. If that's the way you wanna play it, that's how we'll play it.

  Serena
No, I'm not afraid of you anymore.

  Georgina
Oh? You should be. 'Cause all bets are off.

  Serena
Why? What are you gonna do?

  Georgina
It's not what I'm gonna do, sweetie. It's who I'm gonna do it with...

  Serena
No. I know Dan. He's too good.

  Georgina, hanging up
You sure about that?

  Dan, with coffee
How did everything go with your Mom?

  Georgina, tossing his phone's battery
Good. Yeah. She was glad I finally found someone I could trust. Um... Are you sure that you don't mind missing the after party to have coffee with me?

  Dan
You know what? After the day I've had, there's no place I'd rather be.

[She kisses him, and he kisses her back, while at the show, Serena stares into space.]

  Gossip Girl
"If I were you, S, I'd be worried. In the city that never sleeps, a lot can happen in one night..."

[Dan leads her away.]

  Gossip Girl
"Sweet dreams, Serena. XOXO, Gossip Girl."

The moment I met you, I've been falling for you.

  Chuck
Why don't you just tell Dan about her?

  Serena
Because she has that tape of me, and she'll use it.

  Chuck, to Blair
You held a certain fascination when you were beautiful. I don't want you anymore.

  Serena, of Chuck and Blair
Eventually the two of you are gonna have to work out your issues.

  Blair
What if I told you I knew where Georgina Sparks was?

  Chuck
I'd say let's get the bitch.

  Serena, in Queens
Thank God you called, I'm here looking for you right now. Where are you?

  Georgina, on Dan's phone
With me.

  Serena
What are you gonna do?

  Georgina
It's not what I'm gonna do, it's who I'm gonna do it with.

  Nate
The drugs were Dad's...

  Anne
Your father is facing some other charges.

  Bart
Would you do me the honor of being my wife?

  Lily, of Bart
He proposed before we left, and I'm going to say yes.

  Rufus
I'm sure you'll make a beautiful bride.

[They kiss.]

  Georgina
You don't mind missing the after party?

  Dan
There's no place I'd rather be.

[They kiss.]

"And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell. You know you love me. XOXO, Gossip Girl."

      END OF EPISODE

ACT ONE

[Wandering Central Park, looking insane!]

  Serena, on voicemail
Hey, Dan. I've been trying to reach you all night. I know it's early -- or late, if you haven't slept, like me -- but um, I'm pretty sure after this message I will have officially filled your voice mail, so uh... I'm, I'm coming over.

[She hails a cab.]

[Waking up in bed together!]

  Rufus, answering phone
Hello?

  Lily, waking
Who is it?

  Rufus
Hello. Yeah, this is Rufus... Wow. I'd have to check with the guys, but I'm pretty sure we're available. Yeah, okay...

  Lily, sitting up
Oh my God.

  Rufus, hanging up
Oh my God.

  Lily
...What?

  Rufus
I just got the call. Lincoln Hawk is hitting the road, we're opening for the Breeders. I guess that Luscious Jackson reunion didn't work out... Wait, what was your oh my God?

  Lily, at the curtains
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. It's day. As in, uh, as in wedding day, as in, uh... My. Wedding day.

  Rufus
Right.

  Lily
But, uh, congratulations.

  Rufus
Thanks.

  Lily
No, thank you, uh, for last night. It was, uh...

  Rufus
-- Amazing.

[Her phone rings, he picks it up.]

  Rufus
It's Bart.

  Lily
That's what I was afraid of.

  Rufus
Do you want me to answer it?

  Lily
Do you want me to kill you? (Answering) Hello? No, I know. um... Well, that's because we're not supposed to see each other on the day of the wedding... Okay, that's fine. I'll meet you in an hour. (Rings off) I don't know what Bart wants, but I have to go, um, talk to him.

  Rufus
What about? Any topics in particular?

  Lily
Well, I'm sure I'll think of something.

[Waking up in bed together!]

  Chuck, waking up to a smack
Ow!

  Blair, jumping around
Who? What? When? Where? Why?

  Chuck
We were up late plotting against Georgina. We must have dozed off.

  Blair
And you were on the floor.

  Chuck
Didn't want to hurt my back.

  Blair
Why? It's not like you ever do anything athletic.

  Chuck
Well, that's not entirely true, now is it?

  Blair
Fine. Nothing that requires you removing your scarf.

  Chuck
That was one time, it was chilly.

  Blair
Enough about the past. Before you landed in my bed, we actually landed on a good idea.

  Chuck, jumping into his jacket
Well, I trust you can take it from here. I have a best man speech to write, and no time to write it.

  Blair
Don't worry. I can be bitch enough for both of us.

  Chuck
I still got the scars on my back to prove it. (She shoves him out.) You know, they say if you love something, you should set it free...

  Blair
Ugh. They say when you hate something, you should slam the door in its face.

  Chuck
I love it when you talk dirty, Blair...

[She slams the door in his face.]

[Jogging in the Park, drug-free!]

  Nate
Wow! A stint in rehab sure didn't slow you down a bit, huh?

  Captain
I haven't felt this good in years. Clean and sober. Lawyer's feeling great about the trial.

  Nate
Nice. Well, sometimes things just work out, huh?

  Captain
Sometimes they do. We can celebrate tonight at the wedding.

  Nate
When's, uh, when's Mom getting back from the Hamptons?

  Captain
She's not gonna make it. The landscapers royally screwed up the yard. Apparently all our shrubs look like circus bears...

  Nate
She's gonna miss the wedding to deal with that?

  Captain
That, and, uh, the leak we had in the basement. Place is a mess.

  Nate
I just, um, I was kinda hoping both you guys could meet Vanessa.

  Captain
Oh, right. Right, I forgot you had a date.

  Nate
Well, you and I can just hang till then...

  Captain
The Yankees are on today. Joba's pitching lights out right now.

  Nate
All right, sounds good.

  Captain, answering his phone
I gotta take this. It's my sponsor.

  Nate
Oh, sorry. Um, I'll just see you at home then?

  Captain, alone
Hey, it's me. Yes, yes. Everything is discussed. Don't be late, don't be early. I'll slip out right after the ceremony. Just be there, waiting.

[S finally finds the loft!]

  Serena, kissing him
Hey. Mm. I'm sorry. I know it's early, but I couldn't sleep. I had to see you, and you're here, which means you slept here, which is a relief, but not a surprise...

  Georgina
Serena...

  Serena
-- But that is surprising.

  Gossip Girl
"They say love conquers all, but maybe love never met Georgina Sparks. Poor Humphrey. Looks like our resident moral compass isn't such a straight arrow after all."


      ACT TWO

[Tension in DUMBO!]

  Georgina
Serena, I'm sorry. The way Dan was talking, I thought it was over...

  Serena, to Dan
Over?

  Dan
Maybe not exactly "over," but...

  Georgina
I should go. This is not what I had planned.

  Serena
No, I think it's exactly what you had planned.

  Dan
Serena, this is not Sarah's fault.

  Serena
No, it's Georgina's!

  Dan
Whatever.

  Georgina
I never meant to get in between you two, I swear.

  Dan
Hey, please. It's okay.

  Georgina
No it's not, because now she's upset.

  Serena, attacking
Yeah I am, you manipulative psycho bitch!

  Dan
Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing? Serena!

  Serena
You have been planning this the whole time! She's lying to you, Dan!

  Georgina, leaving
Goodbye, Dan.

  Serena
I am telling him everything.

  Dan
Tell me what? What is it that you need to tell me?

[Later.]

  Serena
So my mom took me to see his parents. And after talking to them, all I wanted was to come and find you, and tell you everything. Do you hate me?

  Dan
No. No, no, of course not, it's ... It's just ... It's, uh, a lot. And I ... I really, really wish that you told me this sooner.

  Serena
No, I... I know it's my fault. I... I was just so scared.

  Dan
I get it. I get it. I mean, "Hey, I think I killed someone, and I'm being blackmailed by a crazy girl pretending to be someone else" doesn't quite ... roll off the tongue.

  Serena
But it's all over, right? I mean, we can fix this?

  Dan
Serena, I... Last night...

  Serena, standing to leave
-- It's okay. You and Georgina and Vanessa were just hanging out, and it got late, and you fell asleep. I'll see you at the wedding? (At the door.) When I told my mom not to go away with Rufus, I said it was because you and I were forever. I knew I was right.

[S leaves, Dan calls B.]

  Blair
Hello?

  Dan
Blair. It's Dan...

[In a big metaphorical and literal building.]

  Lily
Bart, darling. What is the big mystery? What are we doing here?

  Bart
This is the first building I ever bought.

  Lily
Well, it's quite impressive. You had a good eye even... Even back then.

  Bart
Sometimes I like to come here, just to... Feel how it felt the first time I saw it.

  Lily
Well, there is a comfort in revisiting the things that we loved ... when we were young.

  Bart
But the truth is, I'm not that young man anymore. I think maybe I've outgrown this place, and holding onto it is keeping me from moving forward with what's most important to me now. What do you think I should do?

  Lily
I think you should let it go.

  Bart
I agree. Now can you do the same for me?

[Plotting with Queen B.]

  Georgina, on her voicemail
"Hey, it's Sarah, you know what to do."

  Dan
Voice mail.

  Blair
Okay, like we talked about.

  Dan
Hey, hey, it's me. D. Um, after you left, Serena and I got in a huge fight, and... And she said all this crazy stuff. I honestly don't know what to believe, but... But what I do know is I want to see you. So, uh, call me. (Hangs up.)

  Blair
Excellent work. She's totally calling back.

  Dan
This is so weird. I don't normally do plots against people.

  Blair
Don't worry, virgin. I'll talk you through it. (G calls back.) Right on schedule.

  Dan, answering
Hey.

  Georgina, in a towncar
Hey. I just got your message.

  Dan
Oh, good, good. So... Sorry about this morning with Serena. That was very awkward, to say the least.

  Dan
Yeah, a little bit. Last night really changed things for me. Serena and I left things kind of uncertain, so I... I think I wanna end it. I know I do. Will you meet me?

  Georgina
Our spot in the Park by the pond?

  Dan, hanging up
See you there.

  Georgina, to driver
We're turning around. One last battle, and the war is won.

  Blair
Humphrey, you are a born liar.

  Dan
Thanks, I think.

  Blair
All that stuff about last night was genius. Anything you wanna tell me?

  Dan
Uh, no. Like you said, just born to lie.

[Their spot in the Park by the pond.]

  Georgina
Honestly, Dan, last night was fun, but I didn't really know what it would all mean to you.

  Dan
Well, I... I normally don't jump into things like that, so when I do, it means a lot.

  Georgina, taking his hand
Me, too. That's why I think we should be together forever...

  Dan
Georgina. Look, Serena told me everything. All right? And I believe her.

  Georgina
No, you don't understand. She was upset, and... And jealous. I'm sure she told you all kinds of things to make you think the worst of me...

  Dan
-- No, just stop it.

  Georgina
I never meant for this to happen, but it did. And I know you feel it too, I mean, how else do you explain last night?

  Dan
I don't know. I don't know, and I wish I could.

  Georgina
So you're just gonna go back to Serena like nothing happened, and just leave me all alone?

  Blair, appearing behind her
Oh, you're not alone, G. I'm here now, and I brought some people who really, really want to see you. I think you remember your parents?

  Gossip Girl
"The only thing feared by the spawn of Satan? Mom and Dad. Leave it to Blair Waldorf to know that bitches don't just happen..."

  Georgina
I...

  Gossip Girl
"...They're made, by parents even more wicked than their offspring."

  Georgina
Okay, I'm ... Mom, Dad, this is not what you think. You have to believe me.

  Blair
There, there, Georgie. It's gonna be okay...

  Mrs. Sparks
-- No, this time, it won't.

  Blair
...Or it won't. Your parents were so worried, G! They told me everything! How you're supposed to be on the equestrian circuit, but sold your show pony for cocaine...

  Georgina
That was a difficult time, but I... I've put that behind me.

  Blair
When? When you were in rehab? It's hard to get clean when you hitchhike into town, steal a credit card and book a ticket to Ibiza.

  Georgina
You didn't see where they sent me, I mean, that place was awful! It was... It was in Utah! At least I lasted longer than Lohan.

  Mrs. Sparks
We were trying to help.

  Georgina
I've had enough. I have to go.

  Mr. Sparks
Georgina, stop.

  Blair, handing her a brochure for "PENANCE!"
Yes. Stay, Georgina. I'll go. Oh, that reminds me. I almost forgot to leave you the information that I discussed with your parents.

  Georgina
What's this?

  Mr. Sparks
Where you're going.

  Mrs. Sparks
A boot camp for troubled girls.

  Mr. Sparks
Blair was kind enough to do some research.

  Blair, whispering
Haven't you heard? I'm the crazy bitch around here. (Brightly.) Have fun at reform school!


      ACT THREE

[The Humphrey Men of DUMBO.]

  Dan
So how long you gonna be on the road?

  Rufus
Well, I'll get the details. We'll figure it all out. But it's kinda cool, right?

  Dan
Oh, it's very cool.

  Rufus
Affirmation from my son. This is an historic moment.

  Dan
Well, last night must have been pretty historic as well, considering when I came home, you hadn't.

  Rufus
Yeah, last night was pretty special.

  Dan
I'm sorry I skipped out early, by the way, Dad. I... I'd love to hear all about it, but I have a... Uh, a wedding. The wedding.

  Rufus
Right. The wedding. Of course. So it's, uh, it's happening.

  Dan
Yeah. Yeah, Dad. It is. (Standing.) Serena told me something about you and Lily. I... I don't understand it fully, but the reason Lily stayed away is because Serena asked her to.

  Rufus, leaving
...Thanks, Dan. That's, uh... Well, just thanks.

[V and Little J enter to show Dan V in the hideous dress Jenny just made.]

  Jenny
Check out my latest creation. What do you think?

  Dan
You clean up nice, Abrams.

[Not really. She grins sweetly anyway.]

[Blair gets out of a car in an even more hideous dress and enters the wedding, which is all a-bustle. Chuck is being thoughtful.]

  Blair
Best man speech going that well?

  Chuck
There won't be a dry eye in the house. Trust me. How did things go with Whorgina?

  Blair
Not a dry eye there either.

  Chuck
Good to know I wasn't missed.

  Blair
Dan Humphrey actually lent a hand, it was nice to see him get his dirty for once. Not sure how much fun he had, though.

  Chuck
No one ever enjoys their first time. Except you. () Save me a dance?

  Blair, grabbing his throat
Now that Georgina is done, so are you and I. She was the last thing we had in common. (Kicking him in the shin and bouncing.) Break a leg.

  Chuck
I think I just did...

[In front, while Eric deals with the wedding planner, the Archibalds arrive.]

  Captain
There he is. Best man ready to do his Dad proud?

  Chuck
Captain, good to see you. ...Nate.

[Nate stares angrily at Chuck.]

  Captain
Clearly, I missed something when I was away. Little advice, fellas? You've been friends a long time. Whoever she is, she's not worth it.

  Chuck
Couldn't agree more.

  Nate
That's the problem.

[Upstairs, B locates S for an impromptu pre-wedding ugly dress party.]

  Serena
Hey.

  Blair
Hey. How go the prenuptials?

  Serena
Well, my Mom's done this enough times. You'd think she'd be a pro by now, but I don't know. Her heart doesn't really seem in it.

  Blair
You think this will be us in twenty years, onto our fourth husbands?

  Serena
A girl can dream.

  Blair
Speaking of true love... Dan isn't here?

  Serena
He's coming.

  Blair
So all is forgiven?

  Serena
I'm working on it...

  Blair
What do you have to work on? He's the one that has to forgive you.

  Serena
Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm working on.

[The Captain meets Dealer across the street from a huge society wedding in plain sight.]

  Captain
You were supposed to get here during the reception so no one would know I was gone. You don't exactly blend in, you know?

  Dealer
You gonna pay me or not?

  Captain
Here.

  Dealer
Good-bye.

[Chuck notes the deal and calls an usher over.]

  Chuck
Do me a favor and keep an eye on Mr. Archibald.

[Lily, in her wedding gown, gulps white wine and puts on her diamond bracelet.]

  Rufus, appearing
Need a hand with that?


      ACT FOUR

  Lily
Rufus, what are you doing here? I thought we had security.

  Rufus
You want them to throw me out?

  Lily
Well, I'd like the option, considering how much I'm paying them.

  Rufus, attaching her bracelet
So you want me to leave?

  Lily
I didn't say that.

  Rufus
Do you want me to call off this wedding? And if you so much as nod yes, I will go out there and I will tell your fianc and your guests they have go home.

  Lily, charmed
I didn't say that either.

  Rufus
We can figure this out.

  Lily
-- How can we? It's been twenty years, and I don't think this is the moment to hash out the details. Look, we've already had the morning after today, what's gonna happen tomorrow morning?

  Rufus
Lil, I just got a divorce. I don't wanna get married again, at least, not right away.

  Lily, standing with her wine
But I do. I've been alone for quite a while now, and you know what? It's hard. And I love Bart. Not just because he has money -- I have enough money. Not that you can ever have enough money, but... I'm rambling. And I'm nervous, and ... You make me nervous.

  Rufus
That's a good thing, right?

  Lily
There are just too many questions, too many. What about Dan and Serena?

  Rufus
Whatever their feelings are for each other, if we're standing here twenty years in the making...

  Lily
Yeah, those twenty years... They have to count for something, don't they?

  Rufus
I think they count for everything.

[At the altar.]

  Eric
Where's my Mom? Shouldn't we be saying vows around now?

  Bart
Your mother is a wonderful woman, Eric, but being on time? Not a strong suit.

[Dan and Vanessa arrive.]

  Vanessa
Let's pray Lily is as slow getting dressed as you are.

  Dan
You said you knew how to make a tie.

  Vanessa
How would I know how to make a tie?

  Dan
I hope Serena doesn't kill me.

  Vanessa
For being a few minutes late to her Mom's wedding?

  Dan
Well, that... Amongst other things. I really have to talk to her.

  Vanessa
Let me guess, Georgina?

  Dan
I thought if I confronted her, it would make things better.

  Vanessa
But it didn't, and now...

  Dan
I have to tell her.

  Vanessa, spotting S
No time like the present. I... I'm gonna find my seat, okay?

  Serena
Hey.

  Dan
Hey. Hey. I have to talk to you.

  Serena
I can't. I have to go.

  Dan
No, it... It can't wait. It's about Georgina.

  Serena
Dan, it's okay. I don't wanna know.

  Dan
No, you need to. I didn't sleep with her.

  Serena, relieved
Oh. Well then...

  Dan
But... I may as well have.

  Planner, approaching
Serena, there you are. Come. Yeah? Come, come, come.

  Serena, freaked
I have to go...

[Rufus and Lily step out into the hall.]

  Rufus
And here we go. Are you sure about this?

  Lily
Ask me again, and I'll change my mind.

  Rufus, taking her hand
I love you, Lily.

  Lily
I love you, too, Rufus.

  Rufus
...And have a great wedding. And try not to trip or anything.

  Lily, stepping out
Oh! I can't believe you put that in my mind. ...Well, luckily I have done this before.

[Vanessa finds her seat.]

  Nate, hugging her
Hey!

  Blair, gawking
Oh! How rude! Can you believe how late she is?

[Sad Serena leads the walk up the aisle in her hideous dress, followed by Lily. Bart is happy but stoic as usual. Chuck squeezes Bart's arm awesomely. Eric is sad.]

  Gossip Girl, speaking along with the reverend
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today in the face of this company to watch this man (Dan) and this woman (Serena) ... totally eff things up. Excuse me while I pull out a hankie and pass it to S and D. Looks like I'm not the only one who cries at weddings..."


      ACT FIVE

[Reception: Lily is bored; at another table, S picks at her food.]

  Dan
How's your food?

  Serena
Good. Thanks.

  Dan
I was being sarcastic. You haven't eaten a bite. Let's go somewhere quiet. We can talk.

  Serena, leaving
Excuse me. I need some air.

[The usher-waiter from earlier whispers to Chuck at Bart and Lily's table.]

  Chuck
You sure? (Breathes; to Bart.) I'll be right back.

  Chuck, at Nate's table with V
I need to talk to you. Your father's leaving.

  Nate
He just stepped out to call my Mom.

  Vanessa
Everything okay?

  Nate
Yes.

  Chuck
-- No.

[N takes C aside.]

  Chuck
He just asked to have his car brought around.

  Nate
He probably left his phone in it!

  Chuck
Before the ceremony, I saw him with a guy, doing a deal. It looked like drugs.

  Nate
My father is clean, Chuck. I don't need you spying on him...

  Chuck
-- Look, I know you hate me. I was in love with Blair, and I'm sorry. We do not have time to argue about this.

[Nate decides he's telling the truth and leaves; Chuck follows; V is all WTF at the table.]

[Outside, Nate chases down the Captain's towncar.]

  Nate
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Stop! Stop! Stop! Dad, what the hell are you doing?

  Captain
I left you a note at home.

  Nate
Yeah? What's it say?

  Captain
It says I'm sorry.

  Nate
For what? Dad, if you've relapsed, it's okay. We'll get you help. Chuck saw you earlier...

  Captain, opening the envelope
I wasn't buying drugs.

  Nate
A passport? You're skipping town?

  Captain
I'm gonna be a much better father to you from Dominica than I will be from jail.

  Nate
No, Dad. I know you're scared, but we'll get through the trial.

  Captain
No we won't! I'm guilty, Nate. I'm facing twenty-five years.

  Nate, crying
So all this stuff about things looking good and working out, huh?

  Captain
Yeah.

  Nate
What about Mom?

  Captain
Who do you think's paying for the private plane?

  Nate
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

  Captain
'Cause I didn't want you to know anything, be an accessory. This is the best thing for everyone. I need you to step up right now. Be the man of the family for your mother.

  Nate, walking away
It's been that for a while now.

  Captain, touching his shoulder
Nate...

  Nate, dropping him
That's for Mom.

[Back at the reception, B sits down to torture V.]

  Blair
Looks like Nate isn't a fan of the fish... Or his date.

  Vanessa
Blair, I'm with Nate and you're at the singles table. Deal with it.

  Blair
I just feel sorry for you is all. Dating an Archibald is a tortured process. The endless supply of family drama, the fact that he never really got over Serena... Though, falling for someone who's in love with Serena, you already know how that feels, don't you?

  Eric
Hey, have you guys seen Chuck? It's time for his speech.

  Vanessa
I'll look for him. (Pointedly, to Blair.) Maybe he's with my date. Excuse me.

[Outside.]

  Nate
So. Thank you.

  Chuck
It's your Dad, it's bigger than... All the other stuff.

  Nate, shaking his hand
I'm sorry... For all of it.

  Chuck
So am I.

  Nate
...So you said you loved her. It's, uh... I never heard you say that before. About anyone.

  Chuck
Ready to go back in?

  Nate
I don't think I'm going back in. Just, um, tell Vanessa I ...

  Vanessa, appearing
-- Tell Vanessa what? (To Chuck, who leaves.) They're looking for you inside.

  Nate
It's a long story.

  Vanessa
I have time.

[Nighttime. Dan approaches Serena in the empty seats from the wedding.]

  Dan, pushing her down
No. Hey, hey, don't... Don't run away from me.

  Serena
Dan, it's okay. So, you hooked up with Georgina, I kinda figured that when I saw her coming out of your bedroom this morning, but... I'm willing to let it go. I don't wanna break up with you.

  Dan
Maybe... Maybe I want to break up with you. Maybe I can't just let it go. You lied to me over and over. And it was easy for you.

  Serena
No, it wasn't easy...

  Dan
I got seduced by a girl pretending to be someone else, and you knew...

  Serena
-- But I couldn't say anything!

  Dan
Well, because you... You were afraid I'd find out you thought you killed someone.

  Serena
I was hoping you'd understand.

  Dan
I am the most understanding person in the world. But this? And, and, and this is not about who you used to be, your past, or who you were when we met. I mean, the only reason I was with Georgina was because yesterday morning you slept with two random guys you met in a bar.

  Serena
No, no, I ... I didn't. I just said that.

  Dan
...How is that less crazy?

  Serena
Because I thought it would be easier to forgive than what I really did.

[No response.]

  Serena
So what, Dan? We're exactly where we were at the Bass's brunch when we first started dating? I'm not who you thought I was, and you can't forgive that.

  Dan
I... I just think too much has happened. I don't know how to make things go back to what they were.

  Serena
So that's it then? It's just... Have a good summer, I'll see you back at school?

  Dan
I guess. Yeah.

[She walks away.]

[The Toast, which B watches intently.]

  Chuck, clinking his glass
I'd like to propose a toast. My father is someone who goes after what he wants, and Lily van der Woodsen was no exception. In typical Bass man fashion, his pursuit was direct and at times, not exactly subtle. One thing I learned from my father's courtship of Lily is the importance of perseverance. That in the face of true love, you don't just give up, even if the object of your affection is begging you to. And one thing I learned from Lily is the importance of forgiveness. She gave my father the gift of a second chance. And in kind, I've watched him become someone actually worthy of that gift. And one day, I hope I'll be lucky enough to find someone who will do the same for me.

[Serena enters, feeling cruddy; Lily takes her hand.]

  Chuck
To the happy couple!

[While Lily and Bart have their first dance, B approaches C in the corner.]

  Blair
That was quite a speech. All your hard work must have paid off.

  Chuck, dancing her onto the floor
That wasn't what I wrote. I was inspired in the moment. Look, I know I said some horrible things, even for me.

  Blair
You mean blogging to Gossip Girl about our s*x life? And comparing me to your Dad's sweaty old horse?

  Chuck
What's your point?

  Blair
What's yours?

  Chuck
You don't belong with Nate. Never have, never will.

  Blair, kissing him
...You don't belong with anyone.

[S, leaving, is weirded out by this; so much so that she runs straight into Lonelyboy.]

  Dan
Oh, sorry. I, uh, I'm looking for Vanessa, have you seen her? I'm trying to get out of here.

  Serena, hurt
No, I haven't seen her.

  Dan, ducking away
Okay.

  Planner
Serena, Dan, out on the floor.

  Serena
Oh no, thank you.

  Dan
Oh, no. No, no...

  Planner
The bride and groom are asking for photos. Here we go.

  Dan
Oh, that's not necessary.
Planner, as the photographers flash again and again: Yes, it is. You're gonna want to remember this night forever, yeah?

[He pushes Dan into S's arms and they dance.]

  Dan
I'm sorry.

  Serena
Just smile.

  Chuck, breaking the kiss
Let's take it slow this time. Do it right.

  Blair
Chuck Bass is a romantic. Who knew?

  Chuck
Well now you do. That's all that matters.

[She leads him off the floor as the photogs leave D and S alone.]

  Serena
He's gone. You can let go now.

  Dan
I know. I don't want to.

[She rests her temple on his forehead and they dance until they are the only couple left.]

 

        ACT SIX
ONE WEEK LATER

[Jenny calls Rufus on his tourbus.]

  Rufus
Hey, Jen.

  Jenny
Ooh! Oh my God, Dad!

  Rufus
Well, hello to you too!

  Jenny
Mom's out getting bagels, Dan's at the gallery, and the mail just came.

  Rufus
I appreciate the play-by-play, it feel as if I'm there.

  Jenny
Yeah, well, uh... The letter came, from Parsons? About my internship?

  Rufus
What?

  Jenny
I don't know. I'm too scared to open it. What if I didn't get it?

  Rufus
What if you did?

  Jenny, giggling
Okay. I'm opening it. Hold my hand over the phone.

  Rufus
I got ya.

  Jenny
And... Ahh! I got it!

  Rufus
That's great, Jen. Does it say who it's with?

  Jenny
Yeah. Um, it's with... Heh. Eleanor Waldorf Designs.

  Rufus
Well, isn't that Blair's Mom?

  Jenny, chuckling and overwhelmed
Yeah. It sure is.

[In B's bedroom, helping her pack.]

  Serena
So, Tuscany with Chuck? Sounds romantic ...Minus the Chuck part...

  Blair
He invited me. In his father's private plane. And I was headed to France, so...

  Serena
So it's worth a week with Chuck to avoid airport security?

  Blair, flashing some black lace garters
Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna frisk him.

  Serena, laughing
Oh! B, gross!

  Blair
What can I say? He brings out the worst in me. And weirdly, I think I bring out the best in him. He's been a perfect gentleman this whole week.

  Serena
Is that why you're driving yourself to the airport?

  Blair
He wanted to see his Dad before he left. Besides, we're taking the helicopter to Teterboro. I have to sit in the jump seat so that ... I can tell the pilot if I have any thoughts on his flying.

  Serena
Oh B, what's it gonna take to get you to relax?

  Blair, in a gross voice
Chuuuuuuuuck...

  Serena
Oh! God! My ears are bleeding! Make it stop!

  Blair, bringing it down
You gonna be okay? Alone, all summer, without your best friend, who always gets you out of trouble?

  Serena
Yeah. I'm... I'm looking forward to staying out of trouble for a while.

  Blair
...Have you talked to Dan?

  Serena
No. Not since the wedding. It's for the best. For him, for me. I'm fine.

[S fake-laughs; B worriedly strokes her arm.]

[Bass Suite; C on the phone with N.]

  Chuck
Yeah, I'll be taking off soon. I wanted to catch my Dad before I left, see how the honeymoon went, catch a glimpse of a man in love.

  Nate
Well, why don't you just take a look in the mirror, Chuck? Taking Blair to Europe, huh? Things are getting pretty serious.

  Chuck
It's no big deal. My Dad's jet was going to Italy on business, Blair was going to France. So, you ... Planning to spend the summer sweating it out in Brooklyn?

  Nate
Uh, I think my time across the Bridge is over.

  Chuck
Nathaniel, what happened with you and Punky Brewster?

[In the Gallery.]

  Dan
So tell me, what... What exactly happened with you and Man-Bangs?

  Vanessa, laughing
He is prettier than me, but that wasn't the problem.

  Dan
And so what was it then? The, uh, the whole perpetually stoned, brooding guy thing?

  Vanessa
I actually enjoyed the quiet. It was a nice change of pace from you.

  Dan
Oh. Was it his past with Serena?

  Vanessa
No. That's just your issue.

  Dan
It must've been, uh, the different worlds thing, right, one of you always feeling like a fish out of water?

  Vanessa
I know exactly what you're doing. Ask me enough questions about Nate, and I won't ask you about Serena.

  Dan
Best offense is always a strong defense. ...I, um... I'm not ready to talk about it. Her.

  Vanessa
Good. Then maybe it'll be quiet for thirty seconds.

  Dan
No, no, no, no, no. You better get used to it, Abrams. Welcome to the summer of Dan Humphrey, babbling at your ass 24/7, from dusk till dawn. Come Labor Day, you're gonna be so sick of me...

  Vanessa
It's been thirteen years, and I'm still not sick of you.

  Dan
Oh, not for lack of trying.

[Back in Manhattan, S spots N on the street, talking to C.]

  Nate, on the phone
Vanessa's a great girl, but I have too much going on right now. All right. All right. Bye.

  Serena, grabbing his arm
Hey!

  Nate, hanging up
Hey!

  Serena
I was just seeing off Blair.

  Nate
I was just on the phone with Chuck.

  Serena
Blair and Chuck. Now there's a couple you can root for.

  Nate
Yeah, well, if they're happy, I guess I'm happy.

  Serena
Oh, come on, Nate. When have you ever been happy?

  Nate
Wow! The gloves are off today, aren't they?

  Serena
I am feeling frisky. You know how I get in the summer!

  Nate
Yeah, I do.

  Serena
Well, you won't have to witness any of it. I'm locking myself away in the Hamptons house. Well, it is a summer to reflect... Alone.

  Nate
I could not agree more. I just need to take a break away from everything and everyone.

  Serena
Yeah.

[They take off; S turns back around.]

  Serena
Hey. Um, if you wanna reflect alone together, I'll be around.

  Nate
What are you up to now?

[Bass Helipad with some ugly random boiler room guy.]

  Blair
Excuse me, is that the Bass helicopter?

  Random
No, it's not here yet. Are you on the Bass marketing team, too?

  Blair
No. I'm a guest of Chuck Bass.

  Random
If he's anything like his father, he must be...terrifying.

  Blair
He's not all bad. He is taking me to Tuscany.

  Random
That's romantic. So where is he?

  Blair
On his way. I had to get here early. I like the jump seat.

  Random
Oh.

  Blair
What?

  Random
Nothing. It's just... I like the jump seat. I have this thing about flying, and it makes me feel more...

  Blair
In control?

  Random, approvingly
Yeah.

  Blair
Yeah.

[Bass Suite.]

  Bart
Who's that?

  Chuck, putting away his phone
Blair. I should get going, I just wanted to see you before I disappeared for the summer. I'm glad you had a good trip.

  Bart
I hope you have a good trip, too. You deserve it. And I must say, I'm proud of you.

  Chuck
Dad, my best man speech was a week ago. And it was nothing.

  Bart
Polite? Modest? You really are growing up.

  Chuck
Let's not get carried away. I plan on holding on to my youth for as long as possible.

  Bart
Sometimes that choice isn't up to you.

  Chuck
That's the best thing about Blair. She knows me, knows I'll never change.

  Bart
Yeah... Until you take her away to Europe on a private jet. That is gonna change everything. But that's a good thing, son. Having a real girlfriend will force you to learn about responsibility, sacrifice, being faithful... Taking into account somebody else's feelings, not just your own.

  Chuck, horrified
...Feelings?

  Bart
All the partying and the women... You will come back from this summer a new man. Take my word for it.

  Chuck
...Oh, I will.

  Lily, entering and laughing with Lydia Hearst
Oh! There you are. This is Amelia. She's been helping me with the apartment renovations.

  Bart
Great. Nice to meet you.

[Chuck gets a text: "Can't wait to see u xo B." Everything slows down and the music gets intense as Bart and Lily leave, then C drops B's bouquet in the garbage and offers Amelia a single flower.]

  Chuck
...Amelia. A moment?

  Amelia
What's this?

  Chuck
I was hoping we could discuss what you have planned for my room.

  Amelia
And who are you?

  Chuck
I'm Chuck Bass.

[Helipad. B's sad with her phone.]

  Random
Everything all right?

  Blair, reading C's text lies
Yeah. It... It's Chuck. I guess his Dad is getting in late, and he won't be able to make the flight. But he's booking something commercial.

  Random
Well, I'd be willing to flip you for the jump seat.

  Blair, setting off with him
Bart did just get the jet reupholstered. And I do like when the ladies make you those cookies... What's ten hours? Absence makes the heart grow fonder, right?

  Gossip Girl
"They say a leopard can't change his spots, but some things do change..."

  Gossip Girl, over Rufus back on the tourbus
"The path not taken can become a road trip..."

  Gossip Girl, over Jenny sewing another outfit madly
"Being grounded can lead to something groundbreaking..."
Gossip Girl, over shots of S&N, D&V, and the helicopter: "And whether they're sweating it out on the sultry streets or cooling their heels in the Hamptons., no one does summer like New Yorkers. Grab your shades and your sunblock, this one looks like a scorcher. Until then, you know you love me. XOXO, Gossip Girl."
END

  Gossip Girl
Unlike us, s*x, lies and scandal never take a vacation. Once summer shows its face, they take the expressway to the Hamptons, where a considerable amount of work awaiting them throughout the season ... Imagine the atmosphere of Park Avenue with tennis outfit and swimsuit ... The players are different, but the game remains the same.

  Nate
I dreamed about that all day.

  Catherine
You're sure Serena is always willing to cover you, I found a little cold.

  Nate
Do not worry about that.

  Catherine
You do not say anything to him for us.

  Nate
All she knows is that I see someone and I do not want to shout from the rooftops for now ... or forever. Listen, it is not yet really recovered from her breakup with Dan ... so I also cover in some way.

  Catherine
Let's go home before someone sees us.

  Nate
In your house? ... It is not forbidden?

  Catherine
It was a home for the guests.

  Chuck
Girls, thank you from my heart for making me discover the joys of geometry in my daily life ... I love it!

  Gossip Girl
Preview! Blair Waldorf at Charles de Gaulle, on the way home. What may well push the Queen B. to abandon her two dads, just as the holidays are not complete. I bet Chuck Bass would like to know.

  Girl
Mr. Chuck! Feel free to tell us if you need something.

  Chuck
Actually the only thing I need is you ... you ... and you.

  Gossip Girl
Preview! Also, Serena Van Der Woodsen on the beach alone again ...What are rumors as the temperature begins to climb between her and Nate Archibald, and usually when there is smoke, the fire is not far. But if the rumor is true. How is it that what Nate escapes our radar and Serena is still playing the solo.I wonder what his reaction would be if she knew the boy was no longer lonely that much.

  Harris
It's possible! People can change.

  Dan
I was assistant to Mr Harris all summer. How did I not see you for?

  Girl
But I was in the room when he gave his lecture in June.

  Dan
No, impossible! I would have seen if you had been there.

  Harris
This is to serve justice. Two options available to you. On the one hand, violence. The other, reconciliation.

  daughter
From now on we will be ... whenever you want.

  Harris
You have questions? ... You have any views on it?

  Dan
I think she has not noticed.

  Harris
And did you notice that I chose to read your favorite chapter?

  Dan
Yeah, and I heard so many times, I feel that it is me who is writing.

  Harris
Well, about. You've finished your paper? You know the one you have to go to the end of your internship.

  Dan
Yes. It's coming soon.

  Harris
Too vague. Try to be more accurate.

  Dan
I'm putting the finishing touches. It's ... almost finished.

  Harris
Noa Shapiro, of Paris Magazine said he was eager to read it.

  Dan
It's really nice of him talking to me. Really. Thank you.

  Harris
I said that your next paper would be better than what you wrote for the New Yorker. Try to not disappoint me.

  Dan
It will be on your desk tomorrow at the first hour.

  Harris
And if you ended up tonight?

  Girl
Hi!

  Dan
Hey!

  Girl
Where do you hide? I thought we would be here?

  Dan
I know, but actually I'm sorry, I ... I'll have to go. Do it again tomorrow? ... I'll catch up promised.

  Girl
Okay.

  Gossip Girl
Oh, well, well. Talk about a lonely boy. Finally, it has served you go out with Serena and drop. I have a feeling he is so find yourself a new nickname.Why not "play boy"?

  Laurel
Oh, everybody. I panic here! Eleanor returns next week and it is far from finished. In addition, I have a big party this weekend, so I'm not there and therefore neither should you. I recommend you engage the mega turbo today or else you'll really regret it.

  Gossip Girl
As for the little Jenny, she had been a very studious, no slippage to report.

  Laurel
Do not tell me you've finished. It is impossible that you're already over what I asked you. You have no life outside of this workshop, Jenny?

  Jenny
Well, actually, I wanted to show you something on which I worked.

  Laurel
We're not in school here, you do not have to show me your work.

  assistant laurel
I was an intern too. You'll see get fixed!

  Laurel
What is it?

  Jenny
Oh, it's a dress that I created for the white party.

  Laurel
To the feast of vitamin water? ... Who invited you? Oh, lace! And besides, it is not even white, it is ivory, not to mention the fact that you will float in it. You could at least adjust it! It is huge.

  Jenny
Well, actually, it's not for me, it is for you. I'm not invited to the party so ...

  Laurel
So you thought that I would agree to wear a Sunday dress crafted by a student eager to see his model on the fashion pages of trendy magazines. There is nothing worse than the ordinary custom. It does work!

  The assistant
Well, what you asked Laurel.

  Laurel
Since you're so good at tinkering with old rags lying around. I sort all these buttons ... and stores it to me, this color gives me a headache.

  The assistant
I'm sorry.

  Dan
We could perhaps order a little something for dinner. Want to eat Indian?

  Jenny
Oh, it's too hot for the Indian. And if we take the ice? And where is mom?

  Dan
She went to a room with Alex. What is all this, homework?

  Jenny
Have you finished your new?

  Dan
Almost.

  Jenny
Great! Maybe it will help me understand why you and Serena have broken.

  Dan
Yeah ... Yeah me too ... Good going Jenny, I'll look for food. I have not for long.

  Serena
This is the first time this year, as I see you look in the mirror. It's going you're not too scary? I wonder what is the reason that you got pushed to take such a risk.

  Chuck
Very funny, sis. I'll just take a look, if you want to know. Now that the triplets are distributed in Rio, I will continue my journey from South America towards Argentina.

  Serena
And the flowers, what is it for? You should not accidentally intercepted a telephone conversation I have had with my best friend, who mentioned his arrival by bus today.

  Chuck
What are you talking about?

  Serena
I conclude that the answer is no and I am delighted ... because you B.ne never forgive what you do to her.

  Chuck
And that's your boyfriend, Nate, who you've passed on this information?

  Serena
Nate did not say anything at all.

  Chuck
So much the better because it would not be very smart of you to follow the advice of someone who pretends to go out with you. Not take me for an idiot! ... I wish you a wonderful evening alone.

  Serena
Good luck on your suicide mission.

  Gossip Girl
Preview! Chuck Bass waiting for the bus, a dozen roses in one hand, and his heart in the other.
You know what they say? Coming home to find a man, that's cool. But coming home with a man ... um, it's even better. Life can be a real bitch, especially when it takes its cue from Blair Waldorf.

  Blair
So, that way you've done nothing all summer? Please do not tell me you spent your time doing crossword puzzles and you goiffrant of junk.

  Serena
No, I did some knitting.

  Blair
And what's all these rumors about you and Nate?

  Serena
This is pure disinformation, but it allowed me to make my small depression in peace and Nate was free to do what he wanted and it worked for both.

  Blair
You're telling me that you do not find a single guy with whom to have fun.

  Serena
I'm ridge dredge by a lifeguard enough gun, but I rembar.

  Blair
What, you a crazy but! The lifeguards were invented for that, you use them, then you throw them. You can not ask for more to rebound.

  Serena
Yes, but I think is ready yet. Dan I still miss a little, then a little more, enormous.

  Blair
The only thing that no longer go out with Dan Humphrey, is to regret not to go out with him. And if you stay proste your chair, it's because this year, you do not have your little flirtation summer.

  Chuck
Yes, the triplets are divided, but I must admit that the Brazilian, there is no better way to make progress in language. A more.

  Blair
Honestly, the guy James is the classiest I've ever recontre. I swear. He does not drink as wines, he speaks six languages and then he offered me a sublime necklace with a gold B on the clasp.

  Serena
I thought it came from your father. Who is James? ... Oh course, I'm stupid.You have one of those chances. The last time we had spoken, you had not even met, I think.

  Blair
That's crazy? There are so attractive, that I scrambled to the second, besides everything he says ...

  Chuck
You're lying!

  Blair
Not at all.

  Chuck
When you lie, your eyes say the opposite of your mouth.

  Blair
I did not know robots could be jealous. Someone humanized your software?

  Chuck
Excellent! We both know that you are using this guy to try to hurt me ... as I've done.

  Blair
You did not hurt! ... Well ok. I admit that the first days I spent waiting for you in Tuscany, were slightly humiliating, but when I realized that you were not coming, I was fortunately regained the lead and I got a buddy.

  Chuck
Well, the menial service. You mean the employee of my father. In fact, I did it back just for you.

  Blair
I owe him everything anyway. It was he who introduced me to James. I think it's the right number.

  Chuck
Prove it.

  Blair
I not show you anything. But if you want to learn more about James, he will be with us tonight. I bet he'll like as much as me.

  Chuck
If by that you mean it does not please me at all, then you're right. See you this evening.

  Blair
Well, what if we tried to find your lifeguard. But first I must pass from Nate, I have something to recover.

  Jenny
How are you doing in Vermont?

  Rufus
Great! Vanessa and her parents came to see us play yesterday. I knew that she was in the corner and when I asked him how was Dan, she did not respond. I had hoped it would help him forget about Serena but this summer ...

  Jenny
I did not feel he needs help for that, and I think Vanessa is realized.

  Rufus
He still chaining rencards?

  Jenny
Well, a different girl every night, it's even a date. I'm starting to worry for him.

  Rufus
Is he here?

  Jenny
It still asleep, he came home late last night.

  Rufus
Tell him to call me when he wakes up! By the way, how did it go with your dress?

  Jenny
Uh, it went wrong. Uh, Laurel refused to wear it.

  Rufus
Why do not you carry yourself?

  Jenny
Dad, it's very nice to want to encourage me to do connaitres my creations, but the white party, this is a VIP area with its own. If you think they will invite an intern. Last year they even repressed Jack Johnson.

  Rufus
What is a good taste!

  Jenny
Dad!

  Rufus
Well, I'm willing to bet that Van Der Woodsen are invited. You in to talk to Eric?

  Jenny
Well, I ... I dare not call it too, since the last time we had spoken, I said unpleasant things. I have done better to spend the summer with you. Eleanor has spent most of his time in Paris and suddenly, Laurel was kind of mega stressed.And if I had goure?

  Rufus
You can not know before going after. Eric is already beginning to be known, then you aviseras.

  Jenny
Thanks Dad. See you Sunday.

  Rufus
There is interest.

  Jenny
Okay Hi.

  Joe
Not today son.

  Harris
No it's okay, Joe. He is with me.

  Joe
Okay.

  Dan
Sorry to bother you at work.

  Harris
You would not have bothered me if you had turned up on time. Something tells me that you come empty handed.

  Dan
All I need is one day. One more day.

  Harris
What? The sixty days you do not have enough.

  Dan
I'm sorry, but I ...

  Harris
Do not sit down, you do not stay! You told me you'd be serious about writing.

  Dan
I know, I tried to write. Really, but every time I sat, my mind was going elsewhere. I could not concentrate ...

  Harris
Your ridges are poor excuses for the unemployed which you belong now. If you are not damn to your work, me neither. You can sit on my letter of recommendation.

  Dan
No, it means a lot for me to work for you.

  Harris
And you did that prove me wrong since day one. Lay my spare key to the mail, that I'm sure you will have time to do so.

  Eric
If you call to say sorry, you're three months late.

  Jenny
Eric, waiting.

  Eric
No, do not tell me anything, you need my help.

  Jenny
Uh, yes ... it's true. Uh, is that at least you appreciate my honesty?

  Eric
Not really.

  Jenny
Look, I know I behaved like the worst bitches, last year, but what you know, I'm wanted all summer. You're the only person who was cool with me and you've taken it on the chin.

  Eric
Well, it's true that you spared me nothing ... Finally, I have not seen a crowd of friends myself, I want to wipe out all the lies, betrayals all or other stab wounds that I received. What do you want?

  Jenny
And Ben, I wanted to know if you were in the Hamptons, right now?

  Blair
Well, I do not expect a horn. It's not classy!

  Serena
In addition, the car is downright cheesy. And worst of all is that it looks great pride.

  Blair
my beautiful track. Good luck.

  Serena
A too. And if you ask me, I'm with Nate. Ok?

  Blair
I do not know why, but okay. Where is he hiding anyway?

  Serena
I know. Salvation.

  Catherine
I'm sorry, but I could not free myself of the day. I do not feel that the summer ends, I broke out like crazy.

  Nate
Nothing prevents us continue to see us you know.

  Catherine
Yeah, but I must be very cautious.

  Nate
I can be very discreet.

  Catherine
Discretion is cute at your age. But mine, but it is much less. Let's talk about it later?

  Nate
If I'm so cute, let us go immediately.

  Catherine
And if I found a way to make you shut up?
...

  Chuck
So James, I guess you had the opportunity to meet with Harold ... and what is the name her boyfriend already?

  James
Who Roman? I've met very quickly to the castle. I also met Cat, which was not particularly welcoming. I have the scars to prove it.

  Chuck
You seem very close to people who have just met. Is that B. has had time to show you his three favorite movies? Roman Holiday, Breakfast at Tiffany's and Charade course.

  James
It's not funny little face, the third?

  Blair
Gagne. I hate Charade! Relented, Chuck.

  Eric
Yes, uh, the QCM on Blair Waldorf does not represent any interest for those who already know the answers.

  Cece
And that lack of subtlety.

  Chuck
Thank you grandmother.

  Cece
Why is it that in your mouth, the word sounds like an insult?

  James
Well, I do not feel harassed. On the contrary, the more I learn about Blair, I am more happy and ... it is there better than learning a quiz?

  Chuck
First, you should have taken a limousine, rather than the bus! I do not know if you have said but B. is crazy limos ...

  Blair
Treasury, you can pass the salt and pepper, please.

  Chuck
I'm sorry, I just suddenly lose your appetite.

  Blair
I for one minute.

  Blair
Chuck!

  Chuck
I know the story of this pin. You had given Nate when you told her you loved her.

  Blair
And I asked him to make. I wanted James the door.

  Chuck
Do ... do you feel about this type, what you felt for Nate?

  Blair
I think so.

  Chuck
I'll see you in high school.
Blair returns to table.

  Blair
Well gosh, my pin has foolishly entangled in your sweater.

  James
It's funny, I had not noticed.

  Blair
I do not either.

  Catherine
Well Nate, you have a choice, either in bed or out the window.

  Nate
What?

  Catherine
My husband just to park.

  Nate
Your husband? I thought he was going not until next week.

  Catherine
It seems he is ahead.
Nate jumps out the window and crosses the street in his underwear.

  Serena
Nate!

  dude
What is it crazy?

  Serena
I have no idea.

  Blair
Chuck is an asshole! He is absolutely right, I have nothing to do with James.

  Serena
Oh thank you bah, I was thinking too.

  Blair
If I go out with him is only because I did not want to take the plane back on its own. It killed me that Chuck is realizing that he messed my vacation.

  Serena
Oh B., I'm so sorry. It was that hard?

  Blair
I was in my bungalow at the Hotel du Cap and I thought only of him. Right in the fireworks of July 14, all I could see what the b*st*rd is Chuck.

  Chuck
My limo takes me back to New York in an hour, if you want to enjoy the trip?

  Nate
What, do not you come to the party white, with all these beautiful girls in light dress?

  Chuck
Unless it is done sprinkle head to toe, I'm not interested. And then, the city will still be full of tourists as easy prey.

  Nate
Yeah?

  Chuck
Okay. And I must admit I have no desire to see B. playing with his dog all night.

  Blair
If only I could find a replacement more fun than James. It's really hard to find a fake boyfriend, at the last minute.

  Serena
But I found it nice and intelligent, when we drank tea yesterday and it's pretty cute in its way.

  Blair
That's the trouble lies. You know Serena, it fulfills its function. Now that Chuck has decided to return to New York, I'm going to let go of James, and enjoy the party as a bachelor. And your hot date, anyway?

  Serena
It made me feel like drowning myself than anything else.

  Blair
One step at a time, darling. One step after another.
Chuck returns near them.

  Chuck
Well, in fact, Archibald, as summer ends. I can finally say I've never believed in your love affair with my sister can ... It's going to Waldorf?

  Blair
It was going so far.

  Serena
Nate, why are you not reminded me this morning?

  Nate
I can not speak here!
Plan B & C:

  Chuck
So where is Princeton? I thought you had him on a leash.

  Blair
James studied at Georgetown and contrary to what you believe, out of sight, does not mean out of mind.
Map of N & S:

  Serena
When you told your girlfriend was hysterical older, I thought she was in college myself, not that she was married.
Plan B & C

  Chuck
You had to have his head also, because your little darling told us he was at Princeton. We are talking to you when you played dress-up with Serena last night.
Map of N & S

  Nate
Catherine dumped me last night.

  Serena
What, tell me bah.

  Blair
You've misunderstood, Chuck! In addition, he talks all the time its gourmet cafeteria and its rowing club. Georgetown no doubt.

  Chuck
I'm sure he told Princeton.

  Blair
Georgetown

  Chuck
Princeton

  Blair
Serena ... Georgetown, is we're going!

  Serena
Well, it reassures me that Catherine has put an end to all this. We hear about it later.

  Chuck
Eric, it's me. You were there last night, tell me. You remember what factors studied buddy B. ? Yeah ..., bah it's not what he said to Blair! Try to find out more, junior. I'm in the mood to be right.

  Dan
I manage to get a job with my favorite author, and ... and, and I'm throwing. I'm waiting all he asked me to take care of his dirty laundry, until befuddle be drunk before noon, which was, believe me the utmost I never hard ridge.

  Rufus
Harder than finishing your news?

  Dan
I can not write, Dad! I, .. I do not know why.

  Rufus
You're talking to someone who has not finished a single song in twelve years, so I understand. What's your point? Talking about.

  Dan
The end of a relationship between two people from two different worlds.

  Rufus
Pure science fiction?

  Dan
Um ... yeah.

  Rufus
Well if I can afford to offer you a fatherly advice, what ... 400 distance markers ...

  Dan
I can not finish my story, because I can not understand why I'm with Serena.

  Rufus
That's what I was about to say, uh ... if I had time.

  Dan
I'm doing everything I could to spend the summer without thinking of her, because I was scared to see ... The funk that I'm doing something stupid, so, I leftspin, I'm just anything.

  Rufus
Well you spent your summer escape. I think it might be time for you to face reality.

  Eric
Not only James Schiller is not enrolled at Princeton, but it is not to Gorgetown and according to my research, there is no advantage to large universities.

  Nate
Since when do you think you're Sherlock Holmes?

  Eric
So you think James is ...

  Chuck
a bad replay? When you go to enter into high society, there is nothing better than fooling a woman alone. We're going out the big guns! Mike ... I need you informed of one James Schiller.

  Eric
It has a private number one favorite.

  Serena
Nate!

  Eric
I know that face. Good luck buddy!

  Serena
My grandmother just told me you'd be my white knight to the party tonight?But if you're more together with Catherine, why you want me to cover? Oh ...!

  Blair
James! These six days were totally up to my expectations.

  James
Me too ... and I wanted to tell you that ...

  Blair
Me first! ... Sorry. (Eventually I'll see you tonight on the arm of Princeton.)

  James
What's the matter? What you wanted to tell me?

  Blair
I was wondering if you would be willing to accompany me to the white party tonight?

  James
Of course ... I'd be delighted.

  Nate
I know I should not have me use you after the conversation we had this morning.

  Serena
No! I understand that you wanna see it, but be frank, that's not why you want to come tonight, will you assess the competition.

  Nate
No! I just wanna ... I just want to see her with her husband, just once.

  Serena
Yes, that's what I call evaluate the competition, which is pretty stupid and potentially dangerous, Nate.

  Nate
Yeah, you're right.

  Serena
But since I myself have acted stupidly and dangerously in the past ... Oh I'm in no position to make you moral and anyway, I'm not really expect to meet the prince charming in the evening. Meet at 5:00?

  Gossip Girl
Sometimes the stars align to help two old friends to meet ... But they can also be aligned to rekindle a dying love.

  Dan
Hey! You can take me to Sandpiper?

  Taxi driver
Yeah

  Dan
If possible.

  Driver
Yeah

  Gossip Girl
I wonder what heaven will offer Serena tonight. Friendship or fireworks?

  Jenny
Hey! Thank you for giving me a second chance.

  Eric
Thank you to be worthy. You know you're still in the trial?

  Jenny
Yeah.

  Laurel
Yes, it will be his best collection ...

  Serena
Well you seem like, do not hesitate to visit us, chao.

  guy
Ok, hello.

  Catherine
Excuse me a moment ... You try to break my relationship?

  Nate
I'm thirsty!

  Serena
I'll go with.

  Cece
Daniel Humphrey! This for a surprise, it's a surprise!

  Dan
Is Serena's there?

  Cece
No, she went to a party at which I myself am invited. I am very late, could you please ...?

  Dan
Oh, yes of course ... If you really want ... And voila!

  Cece
Thank you.

  Dan
Oh, you, you seem ... I dunno, different.

  Cece
Some things are in remission Mr. Humphrey. And therefore, the way I see things too, when you cross what I went through, I assure you we see life differently.

  Dan
Yeah, like what?

  Cece
Well, as is to realize that the recipe for happiness is not necessarily the same for everyone.
Serena believes fooled me see this summer, but I'm not blind, you are always in his heart, Daniel.

  Dan
I had Goure home!

  Cece
The party to which you will accompany me to a strict dress code.

  James
Well, getting back to what I wanted ... that I tried to tell you just now, well, my feelings for you have changed and I keep telling myself that I'm doing something really, really stupid, that you do not deserve ...

  Blair
What you can be funny!

  James
I'm sorry.

  Blair
I get tired of listening to you.

  James
I say something funny?

  Jenny
A vitamin water.

  Server
You want what perfume?

  Jenny
Uh ... rescue, please.

  Server
Ok

  Laurel
Put two.

  server
Immediately.

  Laurel
So Jenny, how you have managed to go? And with this dress and more. I went to the entry and your name was not on the list. I was told you were there because you went with someone. But I can not believe that a girl like you can know a single person here.

  Jenny
Oh, look there is just someone I know happens.

  Eric
Jenny, I present Tinsley Martinez, a friend of my mother and Tinsley, that's my friend Jenny, whom I have spoken and now Laurel.

  Tinsley
Pleased to meet you Jenny.

  Jenny
Nice to meet me too. It's crazy, I got a book with pictures from magazines that I cut and you are on each one. I think you are insane.

  Tinsley
What it is nice, thank you. Eric told me you wanted to be a stylist, you wear one of your creations?

  Jenny
Yes, it's me who designed this dress is.

  Blair
What's happening?

  James
You've used to make Chuck jealous.

  Blair
Anything!

  James
It's no wonder you hate Charade. It touches you too closely.

  Blair
You know nothing. Chuck is somebody who's bad, he makes horrible things and uses people.

  James
And you think you are different? How could I be so stupid? You like me at all actually.

  Blair
No, that's not it, finally, you're, you're a bit boring.

  James
Really? Or is it that you're too obsessed with yourself for you interest in others? You go well together!

  Chuck
You know support where it hurts. I really admire.

  Blair
It's all your fault ... I never needed a James if you do I had not stood up at the airport. You've forced me to use him.

  Chuck
I've have nothing at all. It was your idea. Do not you see it the same? You can not fight against that.

  Blair
On the contrary, I will fight against it, until my last breath because I could not bear to look you in anything.

  Serena
Nate go, okay, it's good, try to do another head.

  Catherine
What are you doing still here?

  Serena
What she just said?

  Nate
She asked me what I was doing there yet.

  Serena
Oh no, this is too much, I put it officially on the door of the club.

  Nate
I do not know what I was thinking.

  Serena
No, stop blame you. Look, it's his fault, if things are where they are today.

  Nate
Yeah I know, but it is so con it all. What I love here is that it is as bad as me right now.

  Serena
We can fix that!

  Gossip Girl
Preview! Serena and Nate kissing passionately before an audience dumbfounded.

  Dan
Sure.

  Gossip Girl
The problem is that Serena did not expect at all to what Dan Humphrey is part of dumbfounded.

  Serena
No! No, No, No, Dan, look!

  Dan
No thank you.

  Serena
No, No, I expected not to see you, you ... you ... well, I'm really surprised.

  Dan
It's weird, because I was not surprised. Nate ...! I guess the bad stories are repeated.

  Serena
No, it's not what you think.

  Dan
Let me guess. There is an explanation?

  Serena
Yes, of course. I was just trying to help him make a girl jealous.

  Dan
Who?

  Serena
Well, that's tricky.

  Dan
Why? Surely you can not tell me either.

  Serena
No, I can not say, but this is not the problem.

  Dan
If that's the problem. There is never a simple answer with you, you can not say: "I kissed Nate," it has to be "I kissed Nate because someone I can not name, would we see, for some reason I can not explain. " It's always the same scenario here or elsewhere ... Oh, what are you doing here?

  fille1
I came with a friend and it is a chance.

  fille2
Because as I know his friend, he introduced us to each other.

  fille1
And over the conversation, we discovered that after reading Harris, when we were kissing.

  fille2
You were supposed to be with me. Oops ...!

  Serena
No! No! No! No! Let me guess. This is not what I believe.

  Nate
Catherine, what are you doing?

  Catherine
Why you kissed Serena?

  Nate
You told me it was over.

  Catherine
I can not believe you're trying to make me jealous for my husband and our friends.

  Nate
And it worked?

  Catherine
Totally.

  Dan
I confess that I have .. a little out of line.
Serena A little?

  Dan
Yeah, that's right, I screwed up and I should not tell you, but ... it is not .. not the first time this kind of thing happens to me ... I ... there's not had a day where I have not thought of you ... I was hoping somewhere. . that I saw you ... I know we had made the right choice .. but ... it's not that I feel ... it's not what I feel at all.

  Serena
Well, I .. I have not really want to talk about that now. For now, I just want to make sure the costume of my grandfather is not completely ruined .. although this suit was already totally ruined in the 70s.

  Dan
If you knew what I miss your laugh.

  Serena
Shh, shh .. just.

  Dan
Ok

  Gossip Girl
When words are too many, there remains only one thing to do ...

  Dan
We're going from here, would you?

  Serena
Yes ... Oh, you just want me to say goodbye to a dozen people before ... uh, what you ...

  Dan
Yes, go ahead, I'll wait on the beach.

  Serena
Great!

  Blair
You were right ... I used your help to get back at Chuck. I did not need you to be interesting .. then the sudden I'm not interested in you. I just wanted you to be canon. What you are.

  Chuck
You fall well! So who is behind this impostor?

  James
I'm afraid that we have something in common.

  Blair
I too am a gun?

  James
Not just ... uh, that's what I was trying to tell you earlier ... I .. I have not been honest with you.

  Blair
Go ahead tell me.

  James
I'm not going to Georgetown or Princeton, or in any major universities ... and there something else I have to confess. That is, in fact ... my name is Marcus Beaton, I am English and I am Lord.

  Blair
Sorry? Why me ... you have not said before?

  Marcus (James)
Most women I meet is only interested in my title. That's why I wanted to make me look like an American ... just to see, but after a few days with you, I was afraid that revealing the truth tee, you're furious with know that I lied.

  Blair
No, I'm not angry Lord ... um, finally your title here is great, but what would please me above all, it's a bit of honesty to change and it is for us both.

  Marcus
When you told me you found me annoying earlier ... someone had told me before and I liked it ... Tell me, what do you have other against me?

  Blair
Fewer and fewer things, but I'll make an effort.

  Eric
It's very good.

  Laurel
So I heard that Tinsley had offered to help you find a new course.

  Jenny
Yeah, it's true. I thanked him, but I learned a lot where I was and could not leave you now.

  Laurel
Well, then spends a good end of weekend ... Jenny. See you Monday.

  Jenny
I'm looking forward to it.

  Eric
You think she was sincere?

  Jenny
No, probably not, but at least it scrapes over my name.

  Blair
Chuck! Will you stop ruining my evening.

  Chuck
I should never have abandoned you, ... I knew I had made the wrong choice as soon as I saw the plane took off. I put my head upside down all summer.I thought it will help me but I was wrong

  Blair
And?

  Chuck
I was scared ... I was scared that if we spent the summer just the two of you ... it opens your eyes.

  Blair
What?

  Chuck
About me ... Please do not go with him.

  Blair
Why? Give me a reason and a reason that makes sense.

  Chuck
Because you are not wanted.

  Blair
That is not enough!

  Chuck
Because I have no desire.

  Blair
Still not enough!

  Chuck
What do you want more?

  Blair
The real reason ... the one that keep me going ... and you turn your back ...three little words, seven letters ... tell them .. and I am yours.

  Chuck
I ... I ...

  Blair
Thank you ... that's all I wanted to hear.

  Gossip Girl
It seems that the holidays are often flirts with no future, but sometimes some adventures turn into true love story ... a simple night on the beach may be sufficient to clarify the spirit and open hearts to write a new ending to an old story .. ... Those who burned their wings, trying to erase their memories, to start anew ... While others would like to see some moments lasted forever ... Anyway, one thing is sure, the summer comes to an end ... the days get shorter, fade and we get rid of the last grains of sand ... but the end of summer c is also the beginning of a new season, then we look to the future ... You have not seen anything yet. Kisses, Kisses. Gossip Girl.

      END OF EPISODE




gossip girl here--your once And only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan'slite.
Waiting for you in Tuscany the first few days were mildly humiliating.
But when I realized you weren't gonna show, I rallied.
Luckily, I made a friend on the trip over.
My name is actually Marcus Beaton.
I'm british and a lord.
Please don't leave with him.
You're telling me you didn't have any fun with anyone all summer? I don't think I'm ready.
i-i still miss Dan sometimes.
Well, I've just been trying to distract myself the best I can.
I was hoping when I saw you, I would know that we did the right thing.
But i-i don't feel that way.
I don't feel that way at all.
What about all those rumors I heard about you and Nate? completely untrue.
They just got people off my back about being sad, And then Nate could do whatever he wanted.
When you told me your secret girlfriend was older, I thought you meant college.
Not to mention, Catherine's married.
I just wish I could make her feel as badly as I feel right now.
You totally can.
I can't believe that you would try to make me jealous In front of my husband and our friends.
well, did it work? Completely.
I haven't been able to get you out of my head all summer.
As summer comes to an end, I'd like to share a few of the things I've learned about fun in the sun.
"gossip girl's guide to summer, " tip number one-- don't fall asleep on the job.
The best hookups are free of morning breath and awkward conversation.
The only thing harder than making up is waking up.
Morning.
What? I'm sorry.
i-i'm just a little, um Overwhelmed? Confused.
Last night was It was amazing.
And confusing.
Okay.
now I'm-- I'm a little confused.
Well, it was so romantic what you did, showing up here, And it feels so right to be together.
But you're having second thoughts.
No.
i-i just think that we should think Before we get back together, right? Y-yeah, I mean, I thought-- I thought this meant we were back together.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
No, I'm not at all.
And neither am i, and--and I want to keep it that way.
But this is a big decision, and--and we did break up for a reason Many reasons.
But this was never our problem.
I will see you back in the city Mmm.
fully clothed With lots of people around.
okay? We'll talk.
Yeah, about our problems.
That sounds great.
Summer tip number two-- there's no "we" in summer, only "u" and "me.
" Find out where you stand before you find yourself stood up.
Anyone can canoodle in july and august, but will he be gone by september? So what's next? I was thinking breakfast-- a little french toast, some coffee.
No.
I mean, since you don't go to Princeton or Georgetown, I assume you're not headed back to college.
So where are you headed? are you staying here? Would it be too forward of me to say I'll go wherever you go? I'd be honored, milord.
Blair, you don't have to call me that.
In fact, you shouldn't-- I know.
don't worry.
I was up all night reading "Debrett's Peerage.
" I'm well versed in your lordly ways, and I'm ready to meet the queen, Which I also watched on dvd, b.
t.
w.
Well, I can see that you are quite prepared.
As you've probably guessed, I have to get back to the city.
Senior year awaits.
Mm.
let me think.
A beautiful girl, autumn in new york.
Well, I think I could find some way to entertain myself.
really? Absolutely.
my family will be glad I'm staying in one place for a while.
Oh, your family.
I'd love to meet the duke and duchess.
Duchess.
right.
w-well, we'll see.
Will you euse me for a moment? Things are going south with lord Marcus.
Who's lord Marcus? James.
It turns out that he was only pretending to be a commoner.
It's like "roman holiday," Only I'm Gregory Peck, and he's Audrey Hepburn.
Oh, suddenly it's all so clear.
He's not really a college student.
He's a lord, and I love him.
Okay, I'm gonna take your word for it, but, Blair, love? Like, very much.
And not just because Tom Hanks gave him a kleenex at lady di's funeral.
And you really expect me to believe this isn't all about revenge on Chuck? Revenge is so 12 hours ago, And just because Marcus happens to be the perfect post-Bass Palate cleanser doesn't mean he isn't a delicious dish in his own right.
Okay, so it sounds like you guys are soul mates.
What exactly is the problem? he's being vague about the future.
Marcus.
hey.
Hello, Chuck.
I was just getting something to eat.
Do you mind if I join you? I do, yes.
uh, I'm dining with Blair.
And I feel I should tell you, I know you two have a history.
Around here, who doesn't? but you're with Blair now.
I get that.
there's no reason we can't be civil.
After all, isn't that a trait your people pride themselves on? Right.
Well, for England then.
Shall we? We shall.
Wait, you just found out this guy's real identity.
I think it's a little soon to be worrying about the rest of your lives.
But not the rest of the year.
It's the season for flings-- tennis pros and townies.
I'm his secret summer shame.
Blair waldorf--a fling? Hmm.
you're not exactly low maintenance.
Speaking of, where were you last night? Did the lifeguard turn up at the party, Or did you find another disposable? Uh, sorry, Blair.
I have to go.
Wait.
Serena! Hi.
hey, I thought you were gonna I thought you'take the train.
Take the--the train.
yeah.
but you're taking the jitney.
me, too.
I-i was--i was just gonna use some of that downtime to do some of the Thinking that we talked about.
and you should, you know, just 'cause, Um, we're not gonna make out, It doesn't mean we have to totally avoid each other.
yeah, right.
well, we're-- it's not like we're-- wee animals.
I think--i think we can share the same bus without, uh, R-running off together.
I'm gonna sit over here.
I'll be here.
And that's me.
Fantastic.
I'll call you.
please.
And, uh Chuck, what are you doing in my chair? Oh, we've got a date to play squash at Chuck's father's club.
Charles, sidebar.
Actually, we weren't finished.
Notice how my voice didn't go up at the end? not a question.
Squash? I'll squash you.
It's just a game, Blair.
Not to me, bass-hole.
I like him.
And so do i, and apparently, he doesn't have too many friends.
Chuck just informed me that he and Serena are leaving immediately.
Do you think I could catch a ride back into town with you? Of course.
Hey, mom.
it's looking really nice out here.
Thanks.
I couldn't sleep, so I got up early.
Are you going somewhere? Yeah, I'm gonna head back into the city, actually.
But there's still a few more days of vacation.
yeah, I know.
I figured it'd be good to get back in and settled before school starts.
I mean, Louisa's at the house, right? It's--it's not a big deal.
no.
I haven't wanted to tell you this, But you're going to find out soon enough.
Find out what? The federal prosecutor has taken your Father's leaving town as an admission of guilt.
They want to forfeit our assets For restitution.
What, they wanna take our money? Well, not yet, but they have frozen our accounts.
And now they're making an inventory of everything that we own.
I asked your granddad for help.
what, you told grandpa? Not that it did any good.
As you can imagine, He's not very happy with my role in your father's departure.
For the time being at least, I've been cut off.
I can't believe you knew all this, and you didn't say anything.
All summer, I kept hoping I could make it go away, and maybe I still can, Which is why I need you to keep your chin up and trust that your mother's got this handled.
No, when he left, dad told me to take care of you.
and you are.
Nate, let's not fight about this, please.
Tip number three-- take time to smell the flowers.
Mom, I gotta go.
let's talk about this later, okay? It's true that all good things must come to an end, And august is no exception.
They don't call it "fall" for nothing.
Hey, this is Nate.
please leave a message.
Nate, it's Catherine.
Listen, last night was not smart.
In fact, it was very, very stupid, Which is why we're gonna have to be much more clever When we get back to the city.
call me when you get this.
Oh.
darling.
Duchess, you weren't home when I packed up.
Just wanted to say good-bye to you and dad before I left.
Well, your father's run up to boston till tomorrow, But I'm sure he sends his love.
Listen, I'll see you in the city for dinner.
I want to hear all about your summer.
and me, yours.
See you then.
Ah.
manhattan, here we come.
Cheers to that, Blair.
Nothing says "welcome home" like a bottle of bubbly Ready? Aah! and a scandal bubbling.
Sorry.
um, I'm done reading my magazine Oh.
and I know that you like The music reviews, so if you want to read it, you can.
Thank you.
Want one? Oh, no thanks.
I'm good.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
So? what are your plans later? I mean, besides racquet sports with your new friend Chuck? Oh, the duchess was hoping we'd get dinner.
Dinner? I'd love to have dinner with your mother.
Oh, she's my stepmother, actually, Not that this makes her an any less forceful presence in my life.
But I meant we are having dinner--she and i.
We haven't seen each other much all summer, so Oh.
of course.
I understand.
It's just You'll be missing my big party.
You're having a party? I can't believe I didn't mention it.
Every year I have a big "welcome back To the city" party for all my friends.
It's only my favorite event of the year.
Then I'll tell the duchess we'll catch up another time.
You don't have to, but thank you.
No offense, but don't you think you're a little outmatched? At squash? I've been playing my father since the eighth grade.
How good can Marcus be? no, I mean, as a guy.
Blair wants to be a princess, And your greatest achievement is owning part of a burlesque club.
Which is why I have to get to know him.
See, no one's that perfect.
Once I get him out of the way, then I'll have a clear shot at Blair.
Oh, you know it's love when you start talking like an assassin.
I think you're jealous of my new best friend.
Well, I have been hoping someone would tag in for a while now.
Hello? Uh, I can't talk right now.
I'll have to call you when I'm home.
Hey, if you need to work out the details of your takedown, Don't let me stop you.
you know me well, but it's nothing.
It's still kind of a mess, but I think you get the idea.
Well? You're being very quiet.
Is that good quiet or bad quiet? Come on.
I'm freaking out.
I'm freaking out.
This place is amazing.
people might actually come here.
That was the idea.
I know, but when I talked about converting our storage space into a cafe, I was thinking of a folding table and a coffeemaker.
Vanessa, thank you.
this is a great homecoming present.
It's exactly what I needed.
What you needed for what? aren't you happy to be home? Yeah, of course.
I can't wait till the kids get back from the hamptons.
I miss 'em like crazy.
And they miss you, too, but No buts.
I had a great time this summer.
I had forgotten what it was like to be on the road, Performing for a live audience night after night.
And now that you remember I'm grateful for the memory.
Now does this place actually serve coffee or what? Yes, it does.
Uh, to go, please.
I need to head downtown.
One house blend, on the house.
And see what else you can find upstairs then.
excuse me.
You Nate Archibald? yeah.
Since this is my house, how about I ask the questions? Don't worry.
your family's lawyer is upstairs, supervising.
Supervising what, exactly? Us.
We've moved into your house, And we're going through every single thing your family owns.
Wow.
you're actually enjoying this, aren't you? Look, no one wants to hold a yard sale.
We want your father locked up.
No, we already told the prosecutors we don't know where he is.
That's too bad.
We'll deal with it.
maybe you will.
But after spending so much time in your mom's closet, I feel like I know the lady.
I don't think she'll adjust so well.
Hi.
it's Catherine.
leave a message.
Hey.
it's me.
uh, listen, I really need to talk to someone.
So, um, I need to talk to you.
So if you can call me, please.
Something tells me you're off your game.
Anything I can help with? Uh, no one can help.
You sure? Well, it's the duchess.
you know how it is.
Tell me.
No one's ever good enough.
I've dated a lot of topflight girls, and she always sends them running.
It's like--and she gets inside their heads, Figures out their worst fears and just--- ruthlessly exploits that fear.
It's rough.
Not to mention, she's completely got my father's ear.
Of course, Blair is desperate to meet her.
And when Blair sets her mind on something Exactly.
That's a match.
I'd say let's keep at it, but I have to get ready for Blair's party.
Party? right.
Thanks, Chuck.
we should do this again.
See you at the Hudson.
Perfect.
And, uh, there was a problem with your cell earlier.
Why don't I get your home number? yeah, sure.
Spotted--Chuck Bass putting his new b.
f.
f.
on speed dial.
Is it the beginning of a beautiful bro-mance That was a good match.
you nearly had me.
Or the end of Blair's bid to be british? Well done, Dorota.
I like what I'm seeing.
Now make the library the sky terrace, the ranunculus dahlias, The veuve clicquot laurent-pierre, and I think we have ourselves a party.
Thank you, miss Blair.
This guest list, however, is a complete page one.
But those are your friends.
Then invite strangers.
I have to present myself as a crown jewel, surrounded by other smaller, Slightly flawed gems, but quality stones nonetheless.
And try to round up a couple people who can vote So it doesn't feel like a total high school party.
A party at the Hudson, huh? I got your message.
Since when are you having a party? Since it became clear that Marcus does not Think I'm worthy of meeting his family.
oh, my god.
Obviously I have some more work to do.
B.
, you don't have to do this.
yes, I do.
Marcus dated the descendant of princess grace.
His consort needs to be able to host royal Dinners and hobnob with oligarchs and dictators.
Well, if you can't find common ground with a dictator, I don't know who can.
Dan likes soccer, right? Or "football," as Marcus calls it.
You think it'd be too weird if he came? um, no, not necessarily.
Good.
You'll call him? Wait, so does this mean you actually think Dan has a redeeming quality? As long as he knows his arse from his arsenal, I think he's aces.
Well, this could be a good opportunity for us to get together and talk.
You know, I have been thinking about the breakup-- ugh! What is to think about? You're finally free from downer Dan, and I have my old Serena back.
So come on.
there's lots of work to do.
Nate.
Hey.
look, could i, uh, could I talk to you for a second? I'm actually in the middle of something.
oh.
do you have a girl here? I mean, what about your devotion to Blair? It's not a girl.
it's business.
I'm, uh, liquidating my shares in Victrola.
Wait, you're selling the club? but you love that place.
Chuck, if you're trying to impress Blair I mean, come on.
look, what you said in the limo was right.
If I'm gonna compete with this guy, I have to rise to his level.
Yeah, but don't you think that's a little extreme? Maybe, but given the situation, it's the right thing to do.
And, uh, I should probably get back to it.
The sooner I get it done, the sooner I can brag about it to Blair.
Okay.
all right.
i, um, I'll see ya.
Yeah.
what's going on? What are you up to right now? Is this gonna take much longer? I told Mrs.
Archibald we could have it done by tonight.
Hey.
hey.
it's me.
hey, you.
did you get my message? Yeah.
Yeah, and listen, before you say anything else, I just want to let you know that, uh, this morning, on the--on the bus Yeah, we didn't exactly stick to the plan, did we? Well, uh, no.
the plan was deeply flawed.
I think we overestimated our powers of restraint Or, uh, i-i-i did, at least.
Yeah, me, too, but then I realized something.
Yeah, me, too.
really? Yeah, well, uh I-i think if we want to figure anything out for real, you know, We--we--we do need to take some time alone.
Sure.
Yeah, um, but Blair's not gonna like that.
Blair? Yeah, it's actually why I called.
Your knowledge of premier league Football is integral to one of her schemes.
She just wants you to come to a party.
a party? Yeah, well, I'll be there, and I really wanna see you.
Yeah.
yeah, I guess we can start with the new plan tomorrow.
You know, They're obviously just trying to scare us to get us to rat out my dad.
You do know where he is, right? Yeah, but I couldn't.
Even after everything he's done.
Just had to put it out there.
But if the worst-case scenario comes true, I promise my sister and I will give your mom Some good pointers on how to do more with less.
I'd love to see that.
The salvation army's having a bag sale on saturday, And Ruby knows this place in the village that has two-for-one taco night.
Stop it.
It's lesbian-mexican.
sometimes their band plays there.
Um, just one second, okay? Hey, mom.
Hey, Nate.
I just wanted to apologize for scaring you this morning.
It turns out I was able to fix things after all.
How? you didn't tell them where dad is, did you? Of course not.
I just got a loan from a family friend.
From who? that doesn't matter.
But I just find it hard to believe that you opened up to one Of the book club ladies and told them we're completely broke.
He's not in book club.
he's outside of my regular circle.
Oh, so you just asked someone you barely know for money? I didn't ask.
He offered, and when I tried to refuse, He insisted that it was the right thing to do.
the right thing to do? You said he's outside of your regular circle? Is he in mine? Nate, please stop it.
let me do this.
Okay, fine.
I won't bring it up again.
Everything okay? No, actually, it's not.
look, I gotta go.
I'll come back later tonight, but I have to find Chuck first.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, the place looks great.
I'm so glad I called you.
I really missed you this summer.
Thanks.
Me, too.
Charles bass? I'm sorry.
I wasn't expecting anyone so young or so beautiful.
Just because I didn't give birth to Marcus Doesn't mean I'm any less interested in his well-being.
I don't usually take meetings with children, Charles, So what do you have to say for yourself? Plenty.
Lordy, lordy, look who's 40-- or at least a well-preserved 38.
We knew Chuck had a thing for older women, But is this risky business or strictly business? Wasn't that wonderful? Thank you, Ingrid and Beatrice.
I'm Ingrid.
she's Beatrice.
That's what I said.
Ah! I just love mozart.
Uh, that wasn't mozart.
Come, come.
Blair, who are these people? Dorota invited them.
Uh, no-- Dan, hi! I'm sorry.
Come meet the lord.
okay.
Uh, h-hello, lord.
I'm Dan Humphrey.
Marcus beaton.
nice to meet you, Dan.
Do--do you know Serena? I do.
He does.
Dan is a football fanatic.
He's a huge Chelsea fan.
Oh, me, too.
I just love the Balenciaga store.
Freshen your drink? Mm.
yes, please.
So, uh Sh-she actually refers to him as "the lord"? I'm so glad you're here.
Chuck.
The name's Dan.
No, Chuck's here, and Blair didn't invite him.
Maybe he's her plus-one.
What are you doing here? Blair.
That's Nate's Mom's friend.
Um, I have to go.
I'll be back.
I thought you might like to meet my friend.
Why? so she can warn me about the effects of too much tox? Blair, is it? I'm duchess Beaton.
The duchess? The duchess? Nice to meet you.
A little soon for flowers, no? Just a few finishing touches.
A much better job than I could've ever done.
You just weren't here to do it.
Sure, but you were.
How would you like to continue? Why? where have you been all day? I, uh, had a meeting with Tanya Donelly.
She has a college tour coming up.
Another tour? What do Dan and Jenny think? Well, before I ask them, I wanted to see if it was even possible.
Alison's open to coming back for a while longer, But I know that summer's over, and you've got your schoolwork.
Yeah, homeschooling really ties me up.
If, however, You're asking if I don't mind sticking around while you're away, It's not exactly brain surgery.
But are you really sure you wanna leave so soon? Well, if I'm honest, I'm not sure what I want.
This was supposed to be my chance to get it all out of my system.
But I didn't know how much I missed it.
I'm not done.
Wow.
that is honest.
Well, whatever you decide, I loved fixing up the place, And I'd be happy to stick around.
Just let me know.
Thanks.
Come on.
if you really like him, just apologize.
What good will it do me now? Duchess? I am so sorry about what I said about the botox.
Your work is flawless.
Look, I know you're here with Chuck, And I can only imagine what he's said about me-- limo s*x, Social torture of freshmen, blackmail.
But I assure you, there is an explanation for all of it.
Save your breath, Blair.
Chuck didn't tell me a thing.
Oh.
he didn't? Wait.
he--he didn't? I told him not to bother.
None of it makes any difference to me, Because nothing will change the fact that despite your best efforts-- which are Completely transparent, by the way-- Marcus is never going to end up with a lowly Waldorf.
Nate.
Nate? Catherine? You two know each other? No.
no, no, no.
yeah, well, just from book club this summer.
But that's it.
they've had no other personal contact.
Uh, Blair's dating Catherine's stepson.
And, Catherine, Nate's Blair's ex.
What's this? Chuck's date and Blair's date are mother and son, And Nate and Blair are exes, and Nate and the mother are in a book club? Now there's a novel plot twist.
This party's a complete bust.
My whole life's a bust.
Well, it serves you right.
You were scheming to convince Marcus you're someone you're not.
But my intentions were good.
I really do like him.
I just As soon as I knew he liked me, I would have relaxed and dropped the manipulative Plotting and devoted myself to being the best girlfriend ever.
See? thank you.
There's my b.
Show this girl to Catherine, and she'll want you to be with Marcus.
This is you.
just be yourself.
She made "Waldorf" rhyme with "Spears.
" I may as well have gone commando and Held my party at Nyla's burger basket.
Fine.
While you stand here and feel sorry for yourself and Denigrate the fine people of Kentwood, I'm gonna go find Dan.
Cheer up.
I can't believe you'd do this to me.
Bring the Duchess to Blair's party? what do you care? No, I know about the money.
Nate No.
you weren't trying to sell Victrola to impress Blair.
You did it to loan my family money? Look, you say it like it's a bad thing.
No, and maybe you were just doing it to be a friend, But I would never let you do that, and you knew that, Which is why you didn't tell me.
yes, it is.
so what? So what? you go behind my back and make a deal with my mom? She called me to see if I thought you were okay.
I didn't know what she was talking about, Because you didn't tell me anything was wrong.
I'll tell you what's wrong-- my best friend lying to my face.
Look, normally, I would agree with you.
But for your mom to open up to me about something like this, I'll handle it, okay? how? Dan, hey.
you leaving? Yeah, I have to get Jenny from the train.
I-i didn't know if you were coming back, so how about coming with you? Why don't we get out of here? Who are we kidding? What do you say we just forget thinking and follow our hearts? Are you sure that's your heart you're following? 'cause Shut up, or I'll change my mind.
Hey, clearly, there are other forces at work here in the universe, so Mmm.
forces much more powerful than us.
I'm glad we had this little talk.
Oh, are you two back together or Uh, uh, no.
this was just a little, uh, friendly-- kiss, yeah.
mm-hmm.
Okay.
are you coming? In library, come meet me Uh, no, no.
you guys, uh, you guys should go ahead.
Oh.
good.
'cause, uh, this elevator's gonna be in use.
Hey.
this is so messed up.
Your ex dating my stepson? yes, it is.
But I actually do know you, Nate.
That isn't what's bothering you.
Well, I think I'm starting to get it, you know, How things are gonna be now that the summer's over.
I mean, It would be kind of nice to have someone who could actually be there.
But when the best version of the situation Is that I'm gonna become Blair's father-in-law? I think it's just time to move on, Catherine.
no, wait, Nate.
Come on, I'm here now, and I want to talk.
Just tell me what's going on.
Hey, dad.
it's me.
Um, I talked to Dan, so he's gonna pick me up at the train station.
So I'll just see you at home, but--oh, my god! stop it! Sorry, dad.
I gotta go kick eric's ass in a water fight.
Love you.
bye.
Yeah.
hey, Tanya.
it's me--Rufus.
I think Anne Archibald would rather die than lose her house, her things.
They're her whole identity.
That's why I'm not gonna let that happen.
I'll find a way.
god, but it's not what she's gonna have to live without.
It's what she's gonna have to live with.
I mean, a scandal will destroy her.
Can you imagine her watching her house seized, Her grandmother's jewels up for auction? I told you, I'll figure something out.
I can handle this.
I just need some time.
You can take care of this With my help.
It'd just be between you and me.
no one would have to know.
I care about you, Nate.
I would do it for you.
And what would I have to do for you? Dorota, have you seen the Duchess? In library.
Oh, my effing god! Well, I don't have to explain myself to you.
No explanation necessary.
I think I got it.
Catherine? She'll just be one more minute, if you don't mind.
Here you go.
Can I just say how sorry I am that I judged you earlier? You judged me? I thought you were just a callow, Social-climbing former swimsuit model who married above Her station only to be enslaved by her own insecurities.
But now that I've seen you rolling around on the floor with my Adolescent ex, I understand you have a compassionate side, too.
What are you saying, Blair? That I think you'll find it in your heart to take pity on me, And in spite of my common, lowly, unroyal ways, Accept that I have true feelings for Marcus and that he has them for me, too.
I think that would be the best thing for both of us, don't you? Oh, there you are.
hello, darling.
Am I too late? As soon as I heard you were at Blair's party, duchess, I knew I had to find you and do damage control.
Is there still time, or have you already scared Blair off? Not at all, dear.
Blair here is a treat.
I can see why you're so fond of her.
She never likes my girlfriends.
She just had to get to know the real me.
Did you say girlfriend? She asked you to make her a dress? I know, right? I already did some sketches on the train.
Dad! Jenny! hey! Oh! I missed you! it's so good to see you.
Mmm.
and a kitchen full of food.
I'm starving.
hey, dad.
Yeah, a little caprese salad, a little gnocchi with pesto.
yummy! First Humphrey family meal of the fall-- I Figured we should do something special.
yeah.
I want to hear all about the Hamptons and everything else that Happened this summer.
well, it sounds like Jenny's got some stories.
So does Dan.
did you hear he finished his? oh, it finally has an ending? Uh, well, this chapter does, yeah.
chapter? Yeah I thought it was a short story.
I'm thinking of reworking it into a novel.
Oh, a novel.
that's not ambitious.
yeah.
Hmm.
someone must think his life's pretty fascinating.
Oh, thanks for the support, guys.
You're both being written out.
well, what about you, dad? You were the one on the great american road trip.
Any, uh, stories worthy of your memoir? Oh, you know, it was fun, but there's no place like home.
Aw! oh, that's an original thought.
You know, if you do write a memoir, you should think about a ghostwriter.
You know, I told you that your back could never handle those bunk beds.
Mm.
face it, dad.
you're getting old.
Yep.
that's it all right.
this looks good.
It looks fantastic.
You were right, as usual.
Well, I don't want to say I told you so, but All I had to do was just be myself, and Catherine loved me.
Oh, I'm proud of you, b.
Great.
Actually, Serena, can we have a second? Um, I'll take that.
I'll just leave-- leave you two alone.
Did you enjoy meeting Duchess Beaton? I did.
That's not sarcasm in your voice.
it's-- victory.
I know.
Your plan to ruin me totally backfired.
It turns out Marcus' mommy is even sicker than you are.
You got along great.
I think she recognized a part of herself in me.
Or rather, I recognized someone in her.
I don't follow.
all you need to know is that you lost.
But don't be too hard on yourself.
It was a solid effort.
tomorrow's another day.
Good night, Chuck.
good night, Blair.
Hey, Nate.
So that maybe took a little longer than you thought.
A little bit, yeah.
Uh, hey, listen.

I'm sorry.
no, no, no.

No, nate.
you don't need to explain anything.
It's fine.
really.
I-- what an unusual little space Half gallery, half boho coffee shop.
But then unusual pairings seem to be the order of the day.
Blair, what are you doing here? Being angry at you, for one.
Here I thought I'd surprise you by bringing vanessa to tonight's party when lo and behold, you two have rekindled your love in secret.
You came all the way to brooklyn to invite me to a party for a school that I don't even go to? It was for nate, dear.
Anne called this morning.
Poor thing has a migraine.
When I thought of you coming all alone, I just wanted to do something nice.
Is that so hard to believe? yeah.
Yeah.
pretty much.
Hello? I got a delivery.
excuse me.
Blair, what are you really doing here? You can't stand vanessa, And you've never done anything when something wasn't in it for you.
You think I'm just gonna sit back and watch you have an affair with my boyfriend's mother? guess again.
so what are your plans to distract me with vanessa? Yes.
what about it? It's just as your plans go, it's kinda nice.
"a," don't be offensive and "b," from what I just witnessed, If you want to keep her, you're gonna have to step it up.
So I can look forward to seeing you tonight? Sure.
we'll be there.
really? Yeah.
why not? Wonderful.
till tonight.
Duchess, it's me.
He's bringing her.
And for the record, whatever you're planning with nate, My bedroom floor is off-limits.
Who was that? A whiff of the far east.
Sometimes I envy you, the way you just-- ew.
What am I saying? you're disgusting.
Relax.
nothing happened with madame butterfly.
Yeah, right.
No.
nothing happened.
Same as nothing's been happening all week.
What are you talking about? You've had different girls every day.
No.
I'll take your incredulity as a compliment.
No, but, I mean, come on.
you--you must have tried-- everything From the erotic to the pharmaceutical.
I-i'm sorry.
I'm not laughing.
it's just so obvious.
You're not over blair.
Wh--come on.
this is your body's way of telling you.
I don't have a romantic bone in my body least of all that one.
But you do raise an interesting idea.
Clearly there's some sort of blockage.
Perhaps No, chuck.
One more go-around, just to clear the pipes.
You are not using blair as sexual drano.
I have to make myself presentable.
I have a party to attend.
By the way Congrats on you and humphrey.
Water always finds its own level.
I just think if we hemmed it and then got Rid of all that stuff by the collar, right? Yeah.
oh, my god.
that's so much better.
I just--i feel like the dress is trying too hard, And this part is so '90s.
Interesting observation.
and who are you? Uh, I'm I'm jenny humphrey, the parsons intern.
Uh, I thought you were going home.
Laurel went to go meet you.
And I decided to come here.
You can, um, leave those and bring the rest of the bags to the apartment.
So now interns have opinions.
I have been gone a while.
Mrs.
Waldorf, I hope that you don't think that I was trying-- that you were telling the model that has to wear my design all the many, many things that are wrong with it? It's hot and late.
We'll finish your fitting tomorrow.
I'm--i'm so sorry.
That was completely, completely unprofessional, And I promise it will never happen again from me.
I s--i swear.
I know you won't.
Not here at least.
I need people around here that I can trust.
Clean out your station.
What? no.
No, please.
You can't-- oh, yes, please, I can, And if you are still hoping for a letter of recommendation, you won't argue.
Why is it so hot in here? Nate! I thought that was you.
a little warm for a run, isn't it? Yeah, you know, I was just, um, had some things to think about.
Will I see you at blair's tonight? Yeah.
uh, you headed down there now or what? No, no.
I promised the duchess I'd pick her up.
oh, your mother's coming.
Oh, yes.
oh, she and blair are fast friends.
I always find them whispering in a corner.
It's a bit troubling, come to think of it.
Anyway, uh, I'll see you tonight.
thanks, man.
This is vanessa.
leave a message after the beep.
Hey, vanessa.
it's nate.
Uh, listen, I'm so sorry, but about tonight-- it's just, um I thought you and dan were leaving for the party.
yeah.
we're supposed to.
He's not still reading one of those dan-and-serena- Should-they-or-shouldn't-they threads, is he? last I checked, yeah.
Something's wrong? I just got a message from nate.
Family drama, doesn't want to burden me-- the same old story.
I just want to shake him, like, I can handle it, you know? hey.
sorry.
I'm, uh, I'm ready.
So how was public opinion on the dan and serena front? Oh, well, it turns out most people think I'm an ass.
But a passionate minority hold I'm just an idiot.
So are you ready? uh, nate's running late.
I'll just--i'll meet you there.
Okay.
you sure? yeah.
Uh, you still positive you don't want me tagging along? Yeah.
No offense, dad, but I think you, Me and serena-- things are awkward enough.
well, it's not like I'd have to be a third wheel.
I can bring a date.
What? No It's--it's not that you having a date is funny or -or completely outside of the realm of possibility, just within the gates.
One day I might surprise you.
go.
See you there.
You know, if you really like this guy, you should call him, Tell him how you feel.
The mature response.
tempting.
Or if you're looking for something immature, You could tell him you left the phone In the gallery and never got the message.
I've seen you be very forgetful.
duchess, here.
sorry to leave you on your own.
Oh, thank you, darling.
my pleasure.
Well, the ancestral home is next to balmoral.
Marcus tells the funniest story about Harry running naked across their lawn.
Prince harry? I love him.
But you've been planning on yale ever since you were a little girl.
I know, but marcus keeps begging me to consider oxford.
What a pity.
so much wasted potential.
What are you talking about? The thing that always fascinated me about you.
The cool exterior, the fire below.
You are living proof a person can't buy class.
And you can't tell me bertie wooster is satisfying your needs.
Titles aside, a suit of armor makes for a cold bedfellow.
Not that it's any of your business, But marcus and I have an amazing s*x life.
Is that so? mm.
What names does he call you when you make love? Where does he put his hand? Does he Have s*x with me.
What? Just once.
that's all I need.
You are disgusting, and I hate you.
Then why are you still holding my hand? I have a party to host.
Hey.
sorry I'm late.
Oh, no.
it's not a problem.
you--you look great, as always.
Thank you.
Oh.
oh, that's, uh, that's troubling.
Maybe we should just go.
yeah.
did I say you look nice? Yeah.
thanks again, though.
Yeah.
you're welcome.
Did you do anything this afternoon? No.
no.
you? No.
Chuck had a japanese stewardess over today.
It's a slow elevator.
Where's vanessa? Not walking into your trap or whatever it is.
Oh, please.
you want me to feel bad? You're not exactly occupying the moral high ground, archibald.
I just hope it's worth it.
Nathaniel, you came.
I'm so happy.
Seems like forever since I've seen you or heard from you.
So you use my friends for some power play to prove you're the one in Control, huh? I don't like sharing my toys, especially if I've paid for them.
Where's your friend? I was looking forward to meeting her.
no, no.
Stop it.
look at me.
I don't know where I'm gonna get the money from, but you listen-- okay, No, nate, listen.
No.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
it was out of jealousy.
Please just don't do something we'll both regret.
no.
Nate? Oh, my god.
Everyone, stay calm.
I'm sure the power will be back on in a second.
Vanessa.
Nate.
It'll be fine.
Sorry to break it to you b but this party just went over to the dark side.
It's a citywide blackout, but we have candles.
Everything's fine.
Vanessa.
Nate, thank goodness.
Would you please tell this young lady Can't go outside in the blackout? yeah.
well, I am.
No, it's okay, marcus.
I got it.
I got it.
Just come with me, please.
I can't believe this.
Here I kept thinking, "Nate's so much different than Blair and all the others," But you're just as bad.
look, it's not that simple, okay? Are you sleeping with that woman? Yes.
Is that the reason you keep canceling on me? Yes, but-- no, Nate.
there are no "but"s.
You lied to me, and you're sleeping with some mrs.
robinson.
And while on the upper east side that might be totally normal I didn't sign up for some creepy love triangle with you and someone's mom.
She's giving me money.
Well, that's just the capper, isn't it? No, my mom and I needed help.
I just-- I had no other option.
Tell me everything.
Now if everyone will just get a drink and a candle, I'm sure the power will be back in a minute.
Blair, have you seen Nate? Um, no.
it's a blackout.
That girl showed up.
they went off somewhere together.
Honestly, Catherine, so what? If they want to be together, you can't stop them.
Just deal with it.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
Hot young guy, Aging beauty enjoying her last hurrah before the surgeries start.
Tt's called a clich? Is marcus everything you could possibly hope for? Yes, absolutely.
Really? thers not one thing that's missing? That one thing you tell yourself you can live without? That you'd happily sacrifice for the rest? so tell you what.
You're gonna sacrifice it every day for the rest of your life.
Nate makes me feel alive.
I'm not gonna give that up.
Yeah, my name's Dan Humphrey.
Yeah.
uh, the elevator's stuck.
Okay.
all right.
thank you.
Well, it's a citywide blackout, so the guy says we just have to wait, Hope the power comes back on soon.
What? No.
no, I know when you're thinking of something.
Just tell me.
no, it's--it's nothing.
Serena.
well, you--you probably should have mentioned my name.
Are you kidding? just forget it.
No, seriously.
You think that there's, like, a box that says, "open in event of serena van der woodsen emergency"? I live in the building.
that's all.
No, it's a citywide blackout, So there--there must be hundreds of people stuck in elevators right now.
Okay, if you're not gonna call them, can we not talk about it? You're making it hotter.
No, Dan-- why not? Yeah, hey.
it's Dan Humphrey again.
Uh, Humph--Humphrey, the guy in the elevator? Yeah.
I know, I know, but I forgot to say that I'm with serena van der woodsen.
Okay.
thanks.
Well, they're gonna send someone, so Um, I guess I'm gonna go now.
Oh, please.
I am not sending you out into a blackout.
You can stay till the lights come back on.
Okay.
thanks.
As--as long as you're here, come here.
hold this.
I just--i cannot-- I cannot decide about this neckline.
Really? I think it's cute.
Why don't you try telling the truth? It's not like I can fire you twice.
Well, it looks like a pilgrim at a funeral.
Uh, I'm sorry.
You're absolutely right.
I am? Yeah.
don't let it go to your head.
But my mom still thinks chuck's lending us the money, So just sending it through me.
So borrowing money from your son's friend is fine, But whoring him out to pay the club bill isn't.
Do you wanna be with this woman? No, I want to be with you.
But I just know that's not gonna happen now, so Nate You have to end this for yourself.
Forget about what I said before.
You are better than this.
I'll be here when you get back.
I see.
Oh--oh, just a moment.
Blair, I'm on with the building manager.
I need you.
What? has something happened? everyone seems quite calm.
No.
I need you now.
Blair--Blair, there's a blackout.
We have guests.
we can't desert them.
I need you to make me feel alive.
Uh uh, wait, wait.
What are you-- what are you talking about? Just meet me up in my bedroom, okay? Looks like lady b.
is determined to have it all.
Question is, who with? Nate? Actually, I was looking for him myself.
Vanessa, is it? Oh, I see.
You're thinking, Look at this awful woman who's taking advantage of an innocent young boy.
Nate told me everything.
I think what you're doing is disgusting.
And yet you're here, waiting for him, willing to forgive and forget.
You must really care for him.
You wouldn't understand.
See, that's where you're wrong.
You have no idea how I feel about nate and what I would do to keep him.
You want me to tell you? Marcus, is that you? Blow out your candle.
I spent the last month going around and meeting with The--the stores and the boutiques that carry my clothes.
That must have been so exciting.
I felt like a fat cheerleader.
As a designer, your worst fear is becoming irrelevant.
Then I come back here and find out the Teenage intern tells me that exact thing.
I'm really sorry.
Maybe that is exactly what I needed to hear.
You know, the first real dress I ever bought was one of yours.
Just spare me the pity.
It's true.
I bought it from--well, from a consignment store ah.
'cause that was the only way I could afford it.
mm-hmm.
I was 12, and I just wore it around the apartment for months.
It was one of the first things that made me want to become a designer.
Jenny.
yeah? The light.
Oh.
sorry.
what you want dan if you want never say my name No, I don't wanna get in this right now.
If i get avoiding dealing with it last year.
Well this is fate that telling us we can.
what are you doing? I'm getting out of here.
No, someone's coming.
The man said so.
Right, because someone always come to say Serena Van Der Woodsen.
That' not fair.
I know it's not.
It's not the point.
Fine.
You know what, life is not fair.
Because it doesn't fit with the way you, Dan Humphrey think things should be.
But why are you always right? No, I never said that.
God hurts.
Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine.
Are you sure? I'm sorry, Serena.
I forgive you, for Georgina.
And I forgive you.
ButI don't know.
We keep having the same fight.
bars and branch.
A year ago, at the wedding.
We talk about the Fight At The Bars And Branch I know.
And now here.
I can't change who I am, Dan.
Me either.
So what happens now? I don't really feel like talking.
Yeah, me either.
Vanessa, I couldn't find her.
Vanessa? Your friend had to leave.

Spotted--lady B's acting not so lady-like.
Hope you get the receipt from the tiara, B.
? Oh, my god.

Blair, what is this? You don't understand.
I thought it was you.
I hear an accent.
Please You know exactly who I was.
Marcus! Marcus, wait! Did you really not know it was him? Can you honestly tell me that? No, I knew it was him.
Thank you.
But I want you.
No, blair.
You want my title.
The idea of who Iam, but clearly you want him.
which.
.
which makes me a fool.
Because I actually did want you.
I do want you.
Then show me.
I'm not some delicate little flower.
Show me you want me.
Vanessa.
what--where are you-- where are you going? I looked for you, but I just--i had to get out.
Did you end it? no, not yet, but I was just g-- okay, good.

Well, it's nice to meet you, and I'm sorry.
Jenny, what's going on? oh.

you can't leave.
We haven't finished the dress yet.

So why'd you get fired? jenny, come.
look.
Um, I'll tell you later.
thank you.
I'm scared.
I know.

When I step out of here, it's over.
I-i think-- I think it was already.
It just took us this long to realize and get used to the idea.
Serena I still-- I know.
Me, too.
I love you.
This isn't going to work.
I thought you said you were better.
I am Just not for you.
Oh, am I crazy or is it actually getting cooler? About time.
You sure you're okay? Yeah.
Yeah, it was the right thing.
You know, i, uh I-i'm--i'm sorry.
I cannot believe that nate archibald is a gigolo.
You cannot tell anyone, remember? hey, who would I tell? Who would I tell except everyone I've ever met? I won't.
I won't.
But why'd you tell him to stay with that woman? I thought you, you know, I thought you liked him.
I do.
That's-- that's why I did it.
I don't understand.
She told me that if nate left her, she would go to the f.
b.
i.
And tell them where nate's dad is hiding out.
So I really didn't have a choice.
Love may fade with the season, but some friendships are year-round, Like you and me.
You know you love me.
Gossip girl here--your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
They wanna take our money? Not yet, but they have frozen our accounts.
You can take care of this With my help.
And what would i have to do for you? This is so messed up.
Your ex dating my stepson? Yes, it is.
I didn't sign up for some creepy love triangle with you and someone's mom! She's giving mmoney.
You have no idi how i feel about nate and what i would do to keep him.
Do you wanna be with this woman? No, i wanna be with you.
I am out for good.
In spite of my lowly, unroyal ways, accept that i have true feelings for rcus and that he has them for me, too.
Blair? Marcus! No, i knew it was him, but i want you.
You want my title, which makes me a fool.
I do want you.
Then show me.
Well, i was on a On--on a date? Yeah, i was gonna tell you guys i've been dating.
We keep having this same fight.
I can't change who i am.
Me neither.
When i step out of here, it's over.
I think it was already.
And who am i? That's a secret i'll never tell.
You know you love me.
Wakey, wakey, upper east siders.
Welcome to the first day of senior year and the onset of a new social dynasty.
The big question is, with serena single and on top of the world, will constance become the house of van der woodsen? I can't believe you got bart to wear flip-flops.
I can't even picture that.
It was so cute.
Every time we'd go for a walk on the beach.
I'd catch him staring down at his feet.
Mom, it all sounds so romantic.
Are we expecting more people? Well, um, it is your first day of school, and i was trying to be motherly.
Mom, i can't believe you didn't wake me up when you got home last night.
I feel cheated.
Last time, you said you felt violated.
Welcome home - say "mom," and i will kill you in your sleep.
\ Decaf, serena.
I was going to say "mrs.
Bass.
" thank you, charles.
Um, bart had to fly to beijing on business, but he sends his best.
As he has done since kindergarten.
Okay.
Hello.
We were talking romantic getaway, walking on the beach.
Details.
I could stay home, and then we could go to lunch together.
Stay home?It's your first day of - serena and dan broke up.
Tragic, if not entirely unprecedented.
Not without an upside.
Humphrey was holding you back.
You're a born queen.
This is your ymcr to rule.
Why fight it? - Because i don't want it, okay? Being queen is blair's whole thing.
Plus, if she needs a eunuch, she knows where to look.
You may feel differently when the trumpets call.
Grab the o.
J.
There's champagne in the limo.
He--he's kidding I think.
Well, so you broke up.
I didn't even know you two were back together.
Yeah.
Are you okay? No, but i will be I hope.
I don't know.
Having to see him every day, it's--it's gonna be really hard.
Well, you know what?Every day gets a little bit easier.
Yeah.
It'll be fine, right? Of coqrse it will.
I mean, we--we broke up amicably.
No one cheated.
No one screamed.
You've got nothing to worry about.
Of course, i don't know what the post breakup protocol is these days.
Yeah, like she gets the courtyard mondays, wednesdays, fridays, and i get supervised visits with the library every other weekend.
You know, be honest with where you're both at.
Just do that, okay? And the deflection through sarcasm thing you might want to put on the back burner for a while.
I, uh, i heard your friend sneak out early this morning.
Clare, is it? Come on.
High heels, concrete loft-- not the blueprint for a-a stealthy getaway.
Sorry.
Uh, back burner starting now.
How are tings going anyway? Uh, it's early, so let's keep thibetween us, okay? Hey.
You look great, sweetie.
Excited for the big first day? Dad, how, uh, set are you on this whole going-to-school thing? Pretty set.
Why? The first day of school is draft day.
Blair and her merry band of psychos are gonna be on the tear.
They categorize girls into two groups-- projects and victims.
Girls with the potential to become little mini blair-ites become projects and total losers, and the girls who have the potential to threaten social order become victims.
I was a project last year, and we all know how that turned out.
What? Nothing.
Totally with you.
Did you understand any of that? I-i'm so glad i'm not a girl.
Melissa murphy, junior.
Let's see here.
A.
P.
Scores good Decent charity work Young women of the american ballet theater Season passes to the knicks? My dad's the team doctor.
Where did you say you summered again? The adirondacks.
We'll be in touch.
* we're gonna have a good day * and ain't nobody gotta cry today * so you're basically using blair's 73stem to screen potential dates? Think of it as an early application process.
So many slots on the chuck bass social calendar.
It'll save me a ton of time.
It seems a bit impersonal.
Thank you.
Are those last season's tory burch flats? I Got them on sale? * we're gonna have a good day * and all my homies gonna ride today * * and all these mommies look fly today* * and all we wanna do is get by today * * hey, we're gonna have a good day * * and ain't nobody gotta cry today * * 'cause ain't nobody nna die today * what is wrong with me? Oh.
And my brother goes to dalton.
Lacrosse captain.
Cute friends.
* hey, we're gonna have a good day * lunch.
Every year the projects pile shrinks while the victims pile I blame the voucher system.
It's like the government doesn't even care.
Last minute transfer.
I thought you should be up-to-date.
Dates will not be my problem this year.
Thanks to your little performance last week, the hrd and i are better than ever.
Now if you'll excuse me I have to find serena.
Vanessa, hey.
Wait up.
Nate, what are you doing here? Uh, you haven't returned my phone calls.
I've been busy.
No, wait.
Just hold on for a second.
You crash the party and you tell me to break it off with catherine and then you pull an 180 and you tell me to stay with her and then you just bolt.
I-i mean, did i do something, or--or what happened? I'm late.
Whoa, whoa.
So--so that's it? I mean, we're not even friends now? We were never really friends, nate.
You'd be the worst p.
I.
Ever.
Well, i don't want to be caught off guard.
I'm so surprised i haven't seen her.
Yeah, especially 'cause you're in the girls hallway looking for her.
Just be nice.
I'm sure this isn't easy for serena either.
It was--it was like i didn't even exist.
Welcome to my world.
It's not so bad once you get used to birds flying into your head and automatic doors never opening.
Yeah.
Well, i guess it's better to be ignored than tortured, right? Well, there's looking on the bright side.
Uh, you know what?I should head to my side of the building.
Good luck.
Oh!Oh, i'm sorry, man.
Oh! I'm--i'm so sorry.
Let me get those for you.
Oh, thanks.
Amanda.
I just transferred in.
I'm dan.
I-i just assaulted you.
Welcome.
I just hid there.
How pathetic is that? No, don't answer that.
Breakups are easy.
It's having to see them date someone alse that's hard.
Why do you think i rub it in chuck's face every chance i get? A twisted version of foreplay? Ignoring you.
You're, uh, you're reading the new harris novel.
Have you ever read him? Read him, i've listened to him, i've fetched him his morning irish coffee.
I interned for him this summer.
The point is, whoever dates first wins.
And with your ex being dan humphrey, you win by default.
Looks like humphrey defied our great expectations and waldorf's rules o order.
Daring to date before serena? It's only a matter of time before it's off with his head Or hers.
The file is sketchy.
She just transferred in.
Her father's with the u.
N.
, she's traveled the world, she won the short fiction award at her last school.
Blair, do you mind? - S.
, this girl is dan with boobs.
Do you really want to see them read together all year? Move her to the front of the line.
Look, i appreciate it, but you're making way too big a deal out of this.
So he was talking to someone.
So what? It--it--it doesn't mean anytng.
I'm fine.
She's not fine.
Call her a person of interest.
* you call me the observer * is that what i am to you? * i only want to uncover * a different point of view what a lovely little gallery.
What are you doing here? I know nate paid you a visit this morning, and i just wanted to thank you, you, show my appreciation for respecting our agreement.
Great.
You can show me by leaving.
See, i was thinking something a little more tangible.
What is this? Open it and see.
** unbelievable.
You really think that Hey.
Hey.
I-i just, uh I waved.
I was wondering when i'd bump into you.
So how's your, uh, how's your first day going? Or something slightly less clich? Good.
Uh, yeah.
School's School.
Yeal Wow.
This is You know, i-i've been really nervous about seeing you all week.
In fact, i still am.
You were? - Yeah.
You are? Uh, l-look, why don't we just fast-forward past all this-- this weirdness and be friends? That sounds so good.
What are you doing for lunch today? Friends eat lunch together, right? They--you're right.
They do.
Uh, the thing is, i-- dan.
Hey.
Uh, amanda, this is serena.
Amanda's new, so i sort of already asked her if she, uh Right.
Great.
Well Um Welcome.
I hope you have I'll see youLater.
Who would have thought humphrey would be the one to move on first? They look very sweet together.
Did i overhear something about a lunch? Class schedule.
New girl.
Now.
Lily? Hello, rufus.
What are you doing? I had no idea you were here.
How was the trip? How--how's bart? Good.
Good.
Um, he's still in beijing.
Oh.
On business, you know.
So What brings you down here, lily? Oh, i just thought it would be nice to, um, to say hello, maybe catch up.
actually i wa on my way out.
of course.
I should have called first.
You're busy with work and - no, i just "repo man" is playing at the sunshine.
You know how i love my harry dean stanton.
Playing hooky? Yeah, don't tell anyone.
Not if you take me with you.
You want to go to "repo man"? Yeah.
As i recall, we went to "repo man" once, and you walked out.
Well, that was 20 years ago.
And you stole my soda] - well, i'll buy you another.
All right.
Let's go to "repo man.
" hi.
My name's blair.
You're new.
Hi.
I'm aman - oh, that's not important.
We'd like to invite you to lunch.
That's really sweet, but i'm already-- we know.
Dan humphrey--bad idea.
It could be hazardous to your health-- social, emotional.
Even physical.
Ouch! Besides, boyfriends are so much less reliable than girlfriends.
We look out for each other.
What do you say? Blair? What's going on? This is amanda.
She'll be joining us for lunch.
Blair.
It's for your own good, s.
They were going to lunch together-- lunch, as in the meal before dating.
Is that what you want? Exactly.
Would you grab my stick? I seemed to have dropped it.
Lady catherine is unavailable.
Would you care to leave a message? If i could just leave this for her, i'm sure she'll get it.
Can i just Very well.
She's not coming--amanda.
What are you talking about? She met some new friends.
To her for lunch.
Hockey sticks were involved.
You know how persuasive our girls can be.
Okay, but why? ?She'll be bound by their laws.
Namely, she won't be allowed to date ex-boyfriends.
Namely you.
No, serena wouldn't do that.
Prove me wrong.
Vanessa.
Hey.
i'm sorry i can't right now What kind of emergency? This is wrong.
Eating here? I know, but the met steps are totally under construction.
No, blair, i mean Amanda? Amanda, we have a few ground rules here.
For lunch? Now that we're all friends, you should know that dating someone's ex is frowned upon.
For instance, serena and dan used to-- oh.
I didn't know.
Of course you didn't.
That's what friends are for.
But now that you know You understand.
Pretty sure - yeah.
Pretty sure? Uh, hey, amanda, would you mind getting some gelato? There's a-a cart right out there on the street.
My treat.
I don't like this, b.
, and i'm not gonna do it, okay? I'm gonna go find dan and apologize.
It's for your own good, s.
So this is Yeah.
And they were about to - that's before kickoff, but yep.
God, why can't i look away? Seriously.
Uh, so what are you gonna about nate?Are you gonna tell him? How can i? He would most likely freak out.
Oh, there's no question about that.
And i can't confront catherine because the butler will remember me and-- and she'll drop the dime on the captain.
Sorry.
That's the only chance i'll ever get to talk like that.
How can i use this to get nate off the hook? I mean, what do i do? Well, you're-- you're not gonna like it.
Blair.
Blair? - Mm-hmm.
I can't trust blair.
Well, maybe not, but google "revenge," you get blairwaldorf.
Com.
Look, she--she helped me with georgina.
She'll know what to do, and when she sees this photo, she will be plenty motivated to do it.
So i have to show this to blair? Yeah.
I mean, i'd wear protective padding when you do it, but--but yeah.
Look, v.
I gotta go.
There's this thing with serena.
Everything okay? Um Yeah, well, we'll see.
Dan.
Hey.
I want to apologize.
And that answers my question.
Look, blair invited her to lunch, not me.
But you were there at lunch.
Yeah, but--but then i left, and i told blair to stop.
So you were part of it, and then you had second thoughts? Dan, i'm trying to apologize.
Real 'cause it sounds like you're just trying to rationalize.
It's--it's just--we knew that this would be awkward.
You know? And i-i just assumed that it would be more of a sad awkward, not this copetitive awkward.
I-i didn't think you'd enlist backup.
Is that what you think i'm doing? Well, you tell mml if--if i have lunch with someone else tomorrow, are blair's minions gonna break her fingers? Just so you know, if this were a competition, i wouldn't need blair and her posse to win.
Hey.
Hey.
Aren't you supposed to not be talking to me, or you'll be shunned or something? I don't like bullies.
Oh.
So my question-- what are we doing tonight? I'm so sorry, blair.
Like i said, catherine knows where the captain is.
She threatened to expose him if i er took nate away from her.
But with this, i was hoping that you might be able - who else knows? What? Who's seen this? Dan.
Just dan.
If you or humphrey ever breathe a word of this-- one word to anyone-- you'll regret it for the rest of your lives.
Do you understand? I just want nate free from catherine.
I don't want him or anyone else finding out about this.
Good.
I'll take care of it.
I'm trusting you, blair.
Like you have a choice.
* oh, oh, oh * oh, oh, oh * oh, oh, oh so are you sure you want to eat here? 'Cause this is, uh, i'm thinking this is maybe not a great idea.
Why?Everyone comes here.
Dan, it's time to send a message.
** i am not sharing my lump crab.
** check it out.
?Is his business.
But when he brings his new maiden to court I can't believe he brought her here.
It's a declaration of war.
Sound the trumpets, strumpets.
What were you thinking? Wh-- i-i was sleeping.
? our gossip girl " oh, no, her--her name's amanda.
Oh, her name's amanda.
Do you have any idea what you're doing? Not only is it social suicide, dan, it's mean.
Do you really think serena deserves to be treated like this? Uh, no.
Look, she started with this girl mafia.
Oh, forget about them.
You need to talk to her.
Apologize before it's too late.
G--chuck! Boundaries.
Get out.
Good morning to you, too.
I had margaurite make you up a little something.
I missed you at S.
T.
K.
Last night.
Mom and i had a girls' movie night.
She made me watch "paris, texas.
" she kept talking about how amazing harry dean stanton was.
Well, i just wanted to make sure you got your breakfast and the morning headlines, especially this one.
Vanessa? What are you doing here? Believe it or not, i'm looking for blair.
Why?What has she done? Nothing that i can tell.
That's the problem.
She won't return any of my calls.
Is there any way you can find out where she is? I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.
Yeah.
Are you lost? I'm looking for blair.
She took the morning off.
She's having brunch at centolire, but i'm sure she wouldn't want to see you.
Well, thanks.
Oh, little j.
, just because we've been ignoring you doesn't mean we've forgotten.
You can't hide out at eleanor waldorf's atelier anymore.
Your day will come.
We're just picking our moment.
Serena - so this is how you want to handle it, using anotr girl to embarrass me in front of my friends? Is that your idea of sending a message, dan? Well, that--that phrase might have been used, but i can't believe you would do that.
Look, i know, and i'm sorry.
I was wrong.
Yes, you were.
I would never try to humiliate you like that.
No, but you would try to coerce girl not too out with me in the first place.
Fine.
Tonight, the three of us.
Okay.
What? Look, you're gonna date other people, and i'm gonna date other people.
We can either let everyone else tell us how we should be jealous and compete, or we can just deal with it and try to preserve at least a little of our friendship.
So you, me and amanda are having a date? I'd rather you not put it that way, but yes.

  yeah, it's a Uh, 8
0.
okay.
This shouldn't be weird at all.
i-i can't wait for you to join us at markworth for the holidays-- snow on the grounds, crackling fire, just the two of us under the stars.
You sure it won't be awkward? Awkward? How? Juggling two women under one roof.
You are sleeping with catherine, right? Or do you prefer "mom"? I can explain.
Hooking up with your dad's second wife? I thought my family was twisted, but you people take the cake.
It's only happened a few times, and i put a stop to it when i met you.
I really opened myself up to you.
Can't--can't we still - oh, please.
I just want to get through this without throwing up in my mouth.
Get through what exactly? I got your message.
What's going on here? Take a seat.
I beg your pardon? Oh, no.
Not yet But you will.
What do you want? Let's talk about your exit strategy.
Lady catherine is not in.
I'm actually looking to speak to her husband.
There's something he needs to see.
Harris hated him.
He called rilke the mitch albom of the 19th century.
Rilke? Rainer maria rilke? "letters to a young poet"? Yeah, i-i gave it to her, actually, but she never read it.
Thoughn her defense, she never read "tuesdays with morrie" either.
This comparison coming from a man who does h best wring sloshed at a pub.
? ? Harris.
Oh.
Uh, you know what? I'm gonna go get another glass.
Okay.
another soda? Belvedere martini, two olives, please.
Doing okay, s.
I wille.
So don't be mad, but we may have something that'll cheer you up.
Several somethings, actually.
* standing there with nothing on * serena, this is jenns, captain of the dalton lacrosse team.
Can i buy you a drink? * i said, "ooh, girl" um ? Even the most chivalrous knight is not above a little romantic retaliation.
It turns out lonely boy is a worthy opponent, and it's time for s.
To bring in the calvy.
? This guy attacked in the crease, akes left.
I faked left.
He faked right, then i faked right, and then wham! Oh! Just laid him out.
Wow.
Amazing.
Yeah, that was a fascinating story.
It was much better than the one where you faked, uh, right and then left, and then you hit him.
Dan's not a big sports fan.
Yeah, i can see that.
Yeah, he likes poets and "letter to poets.
i'm gonna use the ladies room.
Oh.
You know what? I need another drink.
I'll do this again.
Okay.
Okay.
Smokin' hot.
* she grabbed my hand, showed her booty to the dance floor * * and everything else, that was exactly like a freak show * * she like to work it and twerk it * so is this your great peace plan? You invite me out so you can rub lacrosse guy in my face? I didn't plan this.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I'm sure.
What? I thought it was okay that we date other people.
Well, you--you certainly picked a winner.
Well, he's fun, nonneurotic.
I thought thatould be a nice change.
That's classy, serena.
Thanks.
Classy? Like you asking another girl out our first day back at school? We were broken up.
So what, dan? It hurt.
What did y expect? I loved you, and just because we broke up, doesn't mean i can just turn it off like that.
All right.
Um May-maybe--maybe we should stay away from each other for a while.
Yeah, yore right.
You and amanda should probably go.
Are you ordering me to leave? Consider it a suggestion.
Why should i go, dan? These are my friends here, and it's not exactly your kind of place.
Fine.
cashing out so soon, humphrey? You really should wear a bell.
Kinky.
I'll think about it.
I hope you're not leaving.
You're about to see the real serena.
I've seen enough.
not by half.
Hey, blair.
Um, what was so important that we couldn't discuss over the phone? Well, i have some good news and some bad news.
The bad news is that your girlfriend catherine is a lying, manipulating whore sleeping with her epson.
Whoa.
What? catherine and marcus? I know.
It's hard to picture.
I have photos if you'd like to take a look.
I'm sorry.
But the good news is that i convinced them both to leave town.
Well, h-how did you even - and that's not even the best part.
Catherine and i made a deal.
I promised to keep my mouth shut, and she agreed to pay off the captain's restitution.
Congratulations, archibald.
Welcome back to your old life.
Look, i-i don't know-- wait.
Hold that nonthought.
Catherine, whatever it is, just spare me.
What do you mean? Vanessa talked to the duke? No, i told her to stay out of this.
Okay.
Maybe i only have bad news.
Serena's not thinking straight.
She's making this about dan.
It's the new girl that defied you.
What would you suggest? Ninth grade, the danish exchange student who kept flirting with your junior prom date? You still remember how to serve a nair-tini, don't you? oh.
Lily, what-- what are you doing here? Well, serena and i were supposed to have a movie night, but she cancelled, so i thought "pretty in pink.
" it's only a supporting role, but harry dean stanton is excellent.
It's 9:00 at night.
Oh.
Well, i guess i should have called, but i just thought i'd take a chance - lily What are you doing here? I don't know.
Um Bart is being doing business, as he did most of our trip.
The kids are living their own lives, and my life Is in an empty house or in a crowded restaurant, and i don't know which one makes me feel more alone.
I need a friend, and that's why i came to see you yesterday.
I'm sorry, lily.
I Really am, but i can't be your friend.
Yesterday reminded me of how easy it is to fall back into old patterns.
I can't be your safety net anymore.
It's not fair.
You made your choice to be mrs.
Bass.
You need to go do that.
We both need you to go do that.
Rufus? Sorry i'm late.
Hey.
Uh, clare, this is lily.
Nice to meet you.
Okay.
This used to be your favorite.
Nate, it's vanessa again.
Call me as soon as you get this.
We need to talk.
It's important.
What did i tell you? I told you to do nothing.
What, was that too difficult? I thought i would leave doing nothing to you.
I was taking care of it.
How? By having a romantic lunch with your boyfriend? You know what i think? I think you were so scared of anyone finding out who your boyfriend was screwin that you were willing to screw nate.
Catherine's husband promised that the captain would be safe.
It's over.
You know what i think? I think i'd gotten catherine to agree to pay off the archibald debts and leave town in exchange for my silence.
Nate was about to have his old life back until you went to the duke.
He put them on a plane to london an hour ago.
So you're right.
It is over for nate, thanks to you.
Are you really going to do this? Yes.
Why should serena be the one pulling her hair out? Oopsy.
Look at what i've done.
Oh, god.
My hair! oh, my god.
Look at her hair.
What? Is that girl's hair coming out? She's freaking out.
It's her hair.
Totally gross! Amanda.
Hey.
Amanda, wait! No, dan.
Just leave me alone.
Dan.
I'm so sorry.
Is she okay? No.
No, don't.
D-don't what? I didn't plan any of this.
It all--it all just happened.
That's the serena van der woodsen mantra, isn't it? No--no fault, no responsibility, things just happen.
You know, you used to tell me that you were afraid that people couldn't see the real you.
Well, maybe you're the one who can't see yourself.
From--from where i'm standing, this is who you are.
Is that what you think of me? ? ? ? Maybe it's time you did, too.
? ? never again.
From now on, everything goes through me.
Welcome back, queen serena.
Consider us your humbled servants, 'cause if looks could kill, we wouldn't want to be dan humphrey.
Nate.
What are you doing here? I came to apologize.
I didn't know what blair was doing with the deal and the money and You think i care about the money? I mean, i asked you point-blank if anything was wrong.
You lied to me.
I had to.
I didn't know what to do.
What, so you confided in dan? I mean, blair? R everyone but me.
I gotta get to school.
So that's it? We can't even be friends? Well, we were never really friends, remember? Hey, jenny.
What are you doing here so early? Trying to avoid you.
Hard to believe, i know.
You know what i find hard to believe? This handbag.
It belongs in the trash, which is where you probably found it.
Don't.
Ohright.
There may be stuff in here that you need.
Here you go.
Seriously? That's the best you guys can do? I have to say, i was pecting a little more now that you're seniors.
Our methods may lack imagination, but they're very effective especially over a long period of time.
Manda.
It's me-e--dan.
Dan again.
Uh, sorry to be calling you so early.
Look, i'm--i'm really sorry about last night.
If it matters at all, i don't think it was serena, even though i, uh, i blamed her pretty harshly.
Uh, a-anyway, call me.
Getting my hair burned off was not a part of the deal.
The casualties of war.
I don't get it.
You wanted me to pretend to like this guy so he could make his ex-girlfriend jealous? Jealousy is a powerful emotion.
I had to create a monster if i was going to dethrone a queen.
Why do you care who's queen of the high school? ? by the way, i hear you're going to boarding school in vermont.
Something to keep you warm.
You have the day off? What holiday is it? Uh, women's suffrage day.
So why are you wearing your uniform? 'Cause i forgot.
Anyway, it's almost fashion week.
There has to be something i can do.
Well, uh, the worktables are a mess.
Eleanor can't find half her patterns.
Why don't you do that? Okay.
Blair, where were you yesterday? - I was home, just taking care of - serena! Where are we going tonight? The dalton guys keep texting us.
It was a feeding frenzy last night.
Hey, i left you four messages.
You okay - yeah.
I-i wasn't feeling well.
Oh.
You poor thing.
I actually have to get the assignments i missed yesterday.
Oh.
Of course.
I'll see you later.
Wel, well, look who's back on top.
Wait.
Now that i think of it, i know exactly how that happened.
Hmm.
* brooklyn, we go hard, we on the look for the advantage * - Hey.
Uh.
have you seen serena this morning? *Rough it up a bit * we broke, but we rich at heart * let's get out of here.
* it's our time, put the lights on us * * war tactics, they make me sick * * got guns for the strength they lack * * so if you know another way, you can't look the other way * * you know another way * tell them so right to their face * * we think you're a joke, shove your hope where it don't shine * * 8a* i pay for what's called ?* *i hear them all say that i've got heart * * but not everything Sorry, lonely boy.
Don't say we didn't try to warn you.
But if queen s.
Will do this to d.
, are any of us safe? Bow down or bow out.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, gossip girl.
Gossip girl here--your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
You must really want this.
Yeah.
Yeah,i really,really do.
Where's that story of yours? Noah shapiro at the "paris review" is looking forward to it.
I-i know.
I tried to write.
You'll get no letter of recommendation from me.
I need a friend.
I'm sorry,lily.
You made your choice to be mrs.
bass.
You need to go do that.
You're a born queen.
This is your year to rule.
Being queen is blair's whole thing.
Well,well.
Look who's back on top.
I wonder how that happened.
When the white tents blossom in bryant park, it can only mean one thing-- fashion week, the time of year when any park ave princess would trade her last prada pochette for front row seats to the best shows.
and we hear the seating chart to eleanor waldorf's show is being made by our very own b.
This art director just ran off with the husband of this photo editor.
So i sat all of "vanity fair" between them.
I figured we'd want to avoid a catfight in front of the catwalk.
I told laurel my daughter could make a better seating chart than that drug-addled publicist.
It's a blessing she was hauled off to rehab for stealing her son's ritalin.
I'm more than happy to step in.
And you and serena will be with me backstage,of course? Of course.
It's our tradition.
Now i hope you don't mind,but i sat the girls from school in the second row.
Well,since they are your friends,why not? Besides,they'll worship you for it.
I know.
Oh,school.
Another day of reading,writing and aristocrats.
You back to invisible boy? Invisible suits me.
I can go to school unshowered.
I can forget to dress.
Nobody cares.
And now i have all the time in the world to focus on my yale application,so Don't you mean dartmouth? Yeah,well,it seems that dartmouth's whole english department was poached by yale.
Wow.
When's that application due? Monday.
Noah shapiro's helping me choose which stories to submit.
Wait.
What happened to that jeremiah har7s guy? Oh,yeah.
He,uh,well,after he fired me,i went ahead and sent my story to shapiro anyway, and he--he--he loved it.
That's great! Why haven't you told me any of this? Well,i've barely seen you.
You're always off at your internship.
Hey.
You have french first period.
Aren't you gonna be late? Uh.
Uh,we have a sub,and he alays starts late,so Okay.
Well,i'm really late for italian,so ciao,sorella mia.
Hi.
Laurel? Yeah,it's me.
Sorry.
I got stuck in traffic.
I'll see you at eleanor's in five,okay? Kiki smith greeting you in the foyer.
Elm and drag pulling you into the main room.
I love that.
And making a statement on the stairwell-- richard phillips.
Hi,mom.
I borrowed your necklace.
Oh,it's stunning! Serena,do you think-- it's a necklace,mom.
Oh,but i'm talking about the art collection.
Isn't it just breathtaking? Any museum would be thrilled.
Let's hope bart is when he gets back from luxembourg this week.
It's really great,mom.
Your art consultant has exquisite taste.
You got in late last night.
Oh,yeah.
I had the m.
O.
M.
A.
Event with, uh,poppy.
We were perfect ladies,though.
We sipped on sodas all night.
Oh,poppy lifton,the socialite? Yes,they met at a charity affair the other week, and they've been attached at the hip ever since.
Now for over here Yes,the ryan mcginley.
Yes.
Uh,something else.
There's a mapplethorpe that's coming up for auction.
UhWait.
Mapplethorpe-- isn't that the one who took all the pictures of the naked guys? Yeah.
Um,not just guys.
Wait.
Mom,did you Well You modeled for mapplethorpe? Well,i kept it a secret,but i think you and eric are old enough now No,but it's not one of those artsy shots where you can't tell if it's a belly button or a Well,it's very tasteful,i assure you.
You just became the coolest mom on the upper east side.
Mm.
Thank you.
Ah,the besieged queen.
What do you want,chuck? To help.
Your throne's in danger,and you can't wage war on serena without an ally.
You need me.
There is no war.
Now that marcus has been booted back to brighton, i'm free to focus on my old life.
Serena's just been keeping my seat warm.
And how do you plan on making the girls fall at your feet? You going to trip them? A true monarch bestows favors.
It's fashion week,and i'm the only constance girl with clout.
Ladies I trust tomorrow night you won't embarrass me.
Oh,my god.
Second row seats to your mother's show? Oh,my god.
Those are total movie star seats.
Oh.
Serena is in "women's wear daily" With poppy lifton.
Serena could,like,die now knowing that she's lived a fulfilled life.
Hey,guys.
Oh,my gosh.
Is poppy nice? She looks so nice.
Oh,gosh.
I haven't even seen that.
Blair,where are you going? I'll just leave you to your fans.
So when can i meet her? Watching you fail spectacularly gives me so much joy.
And you know what you give to everyone,chuck? Misery.
There's a reason you're always out here alone.
Nate just happens to be away at his grandparents'.
Nate's only friends with you out of habit.
The only person with fewer friends than you is dan humphrey, and at least his lame '90s dad likes him.
And that's because he's something you'll never be-- a human being.
Let me be blunt,humphrey.
These stories are no good.
What? Uh,you--you-- you said my last one was It wasn't bad.
These are just more of the same.
Okay.
You sent me five stories, all about a sheltered young man with girl trouble who lives with his daddy in brooklyn.
You think that's gonna knock the yale english department off their tenured asses? I-i just-- i thought a writer was supposed to write what you know.
This is what i know.
Then learn something new.
Get out of your comfort zone.
A cardinal rule of writing-- if your work's too safe,do something dangerous.
I-i wouldn't know where to begin.
Then find someone who does know.
When i was young,bukowski put a shot glass on my head and blew it off with a pistol.
Find your bukowski.
Then get back to me.
When i said "'50s hemline," i meant like flirty marilyn,not long,dowdy poodle skirt.
I'm so sorry,eleanor.
Fix this thing before i faint.
Eleanor,this seating chart is weak.
Where are all r "it" girls? They're there.
Look.
Well,kirsten dunst? So 2007.
Her rehab stint barely made the radar.
Blair says we can't get "a"-list girls because our show is the same time as marc jacobs.
But those girls bring press.
Without them Eleanor,serena has some new friends.
I bet she could help.
New friends? It's like the plague,only instead of vermin on my doorstep,i get the "human being.
" beat it,humphrey.
My sister doesn't dig stalkers.
Actually,as strange as it sounds,i'm here to see you.
I-i know we don't like each other.
You think i'm a boring,sheltered nobody.
I don't think of you.
Oh,right.
Of course you don't,but,uh,but i've been thinking of me, and--and i've come to the conclusion that i need to get out of my comfort zone.
I-i need to experience new things.
Are you gay? Now that would be out of my comfort zone,but no.
Uh,i just need to get out of brooklyn for one night.
I'd like to experience the world of chuck bass.
You're lucky i'm bored.
Is that a yes? Get in before i change my mind.
Don't ever go to high school,dorota.
The girls are spoiled,stupid and ungrateful.
One snapshot with a socialite and it's all,"serena! Serena!Serena! " have some tea.
Will calm your nerves.
Don't they know that without me,they'd never see the inside of a fashion tent? They'd be stuck behind the barricades with p.
E.
T.
A.
! In fact,i will leave them outside with p.
E.
T.
A.
Maybe that'll teach them some manners.
Something's different.
Who put serena and that poppy person in the front row? And all these socialites? Someone changed this chart,the chart my mother asked me to do! Who changed it? Eleanor said miss Jenny change.
Jenny humphrey? I guess she didn't learn her lesson last year.
Looks like someone needs a refresher course.
What would fashion week be without a fashion victim? Looks like little j.
just started her own trend -- wearing a bull's-eye on her back.
Mom.
Good.
You saw the changes we made to the chart.
Aren't they marvelous? That's not quite the word i was going to use.
Jenny had the inspired idea putting serena and poppy lifton and their friends in the front row.
But i already told you poppy and her crowd never miss marc jacobsbs' show.
And serena would never watch the show from anywhere but backstage with me.
It's our ritual.
None of them will agree to this.
I spoke to lily.
They already have.
Even serena? Absolutely.
Marc is going to eat his grunge corduroys.
All this thanks to little jenny humphrey.
Ah,thgirl is quite a talent.
She shouldered most of the workload at the atelier this week.
How did she manage that after school? Jenny doesn't go to school.
She's got a-a Independent study? Independent study thing this semester.
A 10th grader with an independent study? Mm-hmm.
I just realized i forgot a book at school.
Have fun,honey.
You never learn,do you? Excuse me? Great job ruining my seating chart.
Your seating chart? Blair,i didn't know.
Well,now you do.
here you go.
Wow.
Wow,that's cool.
You just signal the bartender,and she sends over a line of shots? Do you--do you have another signal if you want a martini? Is--is there,like,a insider hand-signal system for the drunken elite? Shut up,humphrey.
i,uh,i'm good with just one.
You're either in for the full ride or you're out.
What's it going to be? all right.
Pass me the shots.
The liquor's just a chaser.
What is that? Does it matter? Go down the rabbit hole or go out the door.
It is so nice to finally get to meet you,mrs.
Bass.
You,too,poppy.
Please call me lily.
Hey,mom,poppy told me that you called her assistant to make arrangements for the two of us to go to eleanor's show together.
Serena doesn't seem to think it's such a good idea.
Blair would be furious.
Things are already tense between us.
And we always watch the show backstage together.
You know that,mom.
I know you did that when you were 12, but it is an honor to sit in the front row, and eleanor specifically requested you.
It is the only way to see a show,serena.
Yeah,but you don't know blair.
She would never forgive me,ever.
Okay,we'll do eleanor's show,and then when we go to the marc jacobs after party, your friend blair can come along.
I have extra passes! See,that is a wonderful idea.
Oh.
Uh,she might be okay with that.
I'll ask her.
Oh,sorry.
Forgive me,girls.
I have to take this call.
It's my art dealer.
Did you find the photo? It can't have already sold.
The auction's not until next week.
Okay,well,find out who bought it and make them a better offer.
Blair,what could we have done to deserve a visit from you? I heard jenny wasn't feeling well,so i brought her some chicken soup.
That's thoughtful of you.
Uh,but i think you have the wrong information.
You mean jenny's not sick? That's strange.
When i ran into headmistress queller, she told me jenny humphrey hadn't bn to school in ten days due to a bad case of mono.
Apparently,her mother called to make sure the school knew.
You know that jenny's working with your mom tonight.
I also know that you don't have my daughter's best interests at heart.
Whatever my motives may be,mr.
Humphrey, facts are facts,and the fact is, jenny hasn't been to school in two weeks.
I happen to have headmistress queller's home number in my phone.
Why don't you ask her yourself? You know,that was so intense,how you talked to those hookers.
Who knew there was a s*x club behind the white castle? Oh,and beer before liquor.
How do you know so many twins? The twins find me.
Ah.
Well,look,you know,i-i-i got to admit,this was,uh,this was awesome.
We gotta do this again.
God.
My feet are hot.
Are your feet hot? Why don't you take off your shoes? That feels amazing.
Arthur,pull over.
This isn't brooklyn.
Aren't you taking me home? Get out.
Wait.
No.
I-i-i hn't-- tonight was nothing.
You're just a drunken idiot My amusement for the night.
Can i at least have my shoes? Spotted--dan humphrey,shoeless and clueless Dad,what are you doing here? I suggest you get up and come with me without another word.
I can't.
Eleanor and laurel are gonna be back any minute.
I don't care.
As of this minute,your fashion duties are over.
Dad,i promised eleanor i'd fix this hem.
She's counting on me,okay? And i counted on you to show up to school, the school to which i pay tens of thousands of dollars every year,might i add.
So i think you've had plenty of practice letting people down.
Dad,please.
I can explain,okay? Why would i believe anything you say? Let's go.
Okay.
They say in fashion,you can become a success overnight.
But one minute you're,and the next you're out.
it's not as bad as it looks.
A girl in my class was e-mailing me my assignments, and i was keeping up with all of my reading.
I just needed to get through fashion week,and it would have been fine.
Being a liar and a truant is not what i would call "fine.
" look,i'm sorry that i cut school and that i lied.
I just--i wanted to help eleanor so badly,and i did.
Dad,i'm really good at this.
Well,i hope you're as good at groveling.
I just spent 30 minutes on the phone this morning with headmistress queller, convincing her that you shouldn't be expelled.
I did my part.
Now you're gonna do yours.
You have an appointment at her office this afternoon to prove you're an honorable person worthy of a second chance.
Go get dressed.
Dad,it's a saturday.
So be glad she's willing to come in on her day off.
What do you want? I tried to reach you all night.
Why haven't you returned any of my calls? What is there to say? You've only taken over the girls at school and abandoned our oldest tradition to go to my mother's show with a complete stranger.
First of all,i didn't take over the girls at school.
Are you really gonna pretend like you don't notice what's been going on? What? These girls are like hummingbirds.
They move from flower to flower.
They'll be on to someone else next week and then back to you.
It's not a big deal.
And i suppose it's not a big deal that you're sitting front row at my mother's show either.
She asked me to do it as a favor.
Oh,and how could you possibly disappoint my mother? Though you have no qualms about screwing over your best friend.
Fine.
I won't go.
Good! And then poppy won't go,and her friends won't go, and you can explain to your mother why she has an empty first row.
Would that make you happy? At least i won't have to watch the next episode of the serena show.
You know,i was coming here to invite you to hang out with us.
Oh,how generous,serena.
I should feel so blessed that you would include me in your little group.
You know what,blair? I am gonna go to that show,and i'm gonna sit front row, and i'm gonna enjoy every minute of it.
Boo! But-- brooklyn kid sees a live hooker for the first time,loses his shoes.
There's so much saccharine in this,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s, it's gi all right,but i did what you told me.
I-went out with a guy i can't stand.
Uh,yes.
This charlie trout character-- now that guy's interesting,complex,a young mephistopheles.
Write from his point of view.
Then you'd have a story.
No,no.
No,there's no way that i'm writing from his point of view.
I hate that guy.
You're judging the character,humphrey.
You think capote got national acclaim for "in cold blood" by judging the murderers? I'm--i'm guessing no.
Dig beneath the surface.
Get into charlie trout's head.
Find the character's humanity.
That might be difficult.
We all have a secret.
A writer's best tool is the ability to draw out a subject's secret and use it.
Okay,so i go back out there,i-i make him trust me and find out his secret? Be ruthless and bring me back a story with teeth.
Did you find it? I did.
Did you offer the seller whatever they want for it? I didn't have to.
You already know the man who bought it.
Excuse me? Your husband.
Bart bought it anonymously.
I had to call in a favor with a frieniaat sotheby's to get his name.
But i never mentioned it to him.
No one knows about that mapplethorpe.
I highly doubt it was a coincidence.
He's bart bass.
I'm sure he found out about it and bought it for you as a gift.
I hate to say that i'm surprised that he knows me so well, but that is the kind of husband i've always wanted.
lena, so glad you could make it.
I love your hat.
Serena! Excuse me.
Is there a problem, serena? Yeah, there is.
Excuse me.
I think there's been a mistake.
My name is serena van der woodsen, and someone else's name is on my seat.
Let me check.
There's no mistake.
Miss van der woodsen is sitting in the back row.
No, she's not.
She's in the front row with poppy lifton.
What are you doing here? My job, no thanks to you.
Don't you have socks to darn? Blair, this is not about you or me.
Go find serena's name card and put it on the correct seat.
Don't touch serena's name card.
It remains where it is.
Jenny, why aren't you backstage? Oh.
What's going on? Uh, it seems like someone's moved serena's seat.
Yeah, someone.
* i promise this what is the matter with you? I am so sorry, serena.
Would you take care of this right away, please? Could you just spare me the dramatics for one day? Go backstage.
Try not to get underfoot.
Jenny, i am so glad that you are here.
Yeah? Good to hear your voice, too, dad.
What is it, chuck? I remembered you were flying in tonight.
I wondered if we could have a drink.
Why?What kind of trouble are you in? Is it unimaginable for a son to just want to sit and talk with his father? Chuck, i'm tired, i'm jet-lagged, andi have to take this call Okay.
Well, maybe later.
Good talking to you, too.
So was that really the best you had last night? Don't tell me that was the great chuck bass.
Stick around.
Hey.
Um, would you mind putting this in the back for me? It's my dress for the after party.
No problem.
Thanks.
Hi.
Somehow my job got mixed up with jenny's, and i want to make sure there's no more confusionl what does the list say jenny's in charge of? Mang sure the models get from here to the runway.
Great.
Thanks a lot.
Spotted--blair waldorf looking to do a good deed? There's a first time for everything.
So what's it really like to be chuck bass? Were you-- were you a happy kid? When'd you start drinking in bars alone? When i realized hot, desperate women drink in bars alone.
What's your father like? Me.
Only older And meaner.
Look, 20 questions is getting a bit boring.
If you'll excuse me, i'm going to pursue a more fulfilling pastime.
Hey.
Hey.
I pay cash up front now.
Let's go.
Excuse me? Oh, my mistake.
Hey.
What's up? That guy just said i'm a hooker.
Did you just call my girlfriend a prostitute? It was an honest mistake.
There's nothing honest about it.
Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on.
Calm down.
He said he was sorry.
Did he?Well, uh, maybe i should teach him some manners then.
It's not my fault your girlfriend dresses like a high-class call girl.
That's it.
You're dead.
jenny! Message one.
Mr.
Humphrey, this is headmistress queller.
I spoke with jennifer this afternoon, and the situation has gotten out of control.
Please call me immediately.
End of new messages.
michael! - Michael! - Oh, you look ggeous, tinsley.
Cristina!Over here! Oh.
Full house.
Mm-hmm.
Jenny, get the models ready to go.
Done.
Good.
where are the models? what models? The models that are about to walk the runway wearing your mother's clothes? Oh, those models.
Somehow they got the idea that they'd been overbooked, so they went home.
What? They went home? They're not the brightest bulbs, are they? Jenny, we start in ten.
Are the models ready? - No.
The models are gone.
What? What do you mean, the models are gone? How can they be gone? Wh--what did you do with them? Are you trying to kill me? Laurel, it's gonna be okay.
What? - I have an idea.
Jail, brawling in public.
You know, i hear yale's looking to recruit more bar fighters this year.
Bar fighters and, um, pacific islanders.
They're looking to round out the freshman class.
For what it's worth, humphrey, you had my back.
Never thought i'd say this, but thanks.
Oh, that--that changes everything.
College versus chuck bass' gratitude-- i think that's a-an even trade.
Oh.
Oh, no.
My dad-- my dad's gonna kill me.
Count yourself lucky.
Lucky?H-how is it lucky that my own father is gonna murder me? My father doesn't care enough to get angry.
Yeah, i'm sure.
Please.
He expects this.
Oh, he'll be annoyed that he has to call his lawyer.
After that Has he always been like that? Since the day i was born.
No, that's crazy.
Even bart bass doesn't hate babies.
It's, uh, it's in our D.
N.
A.
I think disney did a study.
He hated me.
That doesn't make sense.
It does if his beloved wife Died giving birth to me.
That's not your fault.
Tell him that.
Sometimes i swear he thinks i killed her.
Who knows?Maybe i did.
Chuck bass, your lawyer called.
You've been released.
I'll, uh See if my lawyer can have you released into his custody.
If they haven't reached your father yet, maybe they won't have to.
Thanks.
Lily, i'm home.
Aha.
I have missed you.
Good, because i am going to steal your passport and lock you in our room.
Mmm.
That sounds like the perfect plan.
But not before i give you something.
Oh! I mean, if it's not your taste, we can exchange it.
Oh, no, no, no.
The necklace is exquisite.
It's It's just-- you didn't happen to buy a piece of art recently? Perhaps a mapplethorpe? Yes, i did.
You did.
Oh! You did.
You got it for me.
Oh! How did you know and when can i see it? Well, you can't.
No one can.
I don't understand.
Lily, i'm a powerful man, and that makes me and those around me a target, and it is my job to protect this family from anything that can be used against us.
Used against us? Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
H-how did you even know about it? Did you hire someone to look into my past? Do you have a lily bass dossier? I want to see it.
Lily I want to see it.
Everything.
How on earth does one lose models? N-n-never mind.
This is going to be sensational.
"models lost, socialites save the day.
Your show will get so much press, it'll drive marc jacobs to drink.
God forbid.
Every time he goes to rehab, his sales soar.
What do you think? - Well, the dress fits.
Mm-hmm.
How handy is it that society girls are wafer-thin? I hope you know what you're doing.
Yeah.
Me, too.
** hey.
Why aren't you dressed? I don't think i'm gonna do this.
Blair would be crushed.
If anybody's gonna walk the runway in eleanor's designs, it's her.
Serena, i've only known you for a few weeks, but it's pretty clear you've spent your whole life worrying about blair and what she thinks and how she feels.
You don't understand.
I was best friends for years with this girl that was just like blair, and it was subtle, but i was always having to make myself less sparkly so that she wouldn't feel insecure.
Till one day i finally realized that is crazy 'Cause a true friend would want you to be your most beautiful, vibrant self.
No, i just--i really don't want to hurt her.
I know.
I know.
But is that a good reason to hide your light? You're gorgeous, sweet, amazing.
If blair's a true friend, she'll support you.
You're right.
Yeah? Eleanor, where's my dress? Here.
Here.
Blair.
This will be beautiful on you.
It's for the finale.
Are you sure? - Yes, yes.
It's fine.
Just hurry.
Okay.
where's serena? She's onstage.
But i have her dress.
Oh.
You mean serena's on the runway of eleanor waldorf's show in a design not made by eleanor waldorf? Oh, dear.
That's not my dress.
Yeah.
I-it's my dress.
Why did you do this? I waved the white flag at school.
Why don't-- why don't you just claim your throne and leave me alone? Because i can't.
This is about serena.
I didn't realize.
And why would you? Y-you might be privileged, blair, but you work for every single thing you've achieved, like me.
Serena just glides through.
Tell me about it.
I wanted to be your friend last year for a reason.
I wanted you to like me.
Here you go.
Hey, you gave me the wrong bag.
You have letters that i wrote to my college boyfriend? You mean the professor you slept with while at school.
Bart, where did you get these? It doesn't matter, lily.
I love you, and my concern is for our family.
Bart, i'm not ashamed of who i am.
I may have concealed things in the past, but not anymore.
I want my children to know their mother.
Is this something you want your kids to know? Who gave this to you? You were writing about me? Where'd you get that? You watch your back.
No one uses chuck bass.
I hope you enjoy your stay here.
I hope they make a humphrey sandwich.
The story i told you about my mother? I was lying.
My mother died in a plane crash in the andes when i was 6.
You did this on purpose.
You put serena into your dress so you could sneak it into my show.
No, i didn't.
I swear.
When i expose your eve harrington ways, your bright future will be snuffed out like a candle.
Eleanor, andr?Leon talley is raving about the finale dress.
He said it was the perfect culmination to your line, loved it.
They loved the dress? My dress? * ooh * ooh * ooh, yes ** and ? i adapted one of your old patterns.
It's basically your design.
Please take credit for it.
I am eleanor waldorf.
I do not have to take credit for a dress made by a child.
Mom, jenny saved the show.
It was her idea to use the socialites.
And look.
It's a smash success.
Take your bow.
Please? What else are you gonna do, mom? What the hell.
a guy's acting crazy outside, wants to be let in, says he's your father.
Should i put him on the list? Um, no.
My dad is ?.
It's in mistake.
When the phone rang in the dead of the night, i expected a boo from lucy the stewardess, not a call from lockup.
Yeah, look, i'm sorry about this.
I didn't have anywhere else to turn, really.
Police stations at midnight make me nostalgic for my youth.
So it turns out that guy you clocked dropped the charges.
Oh, good.
That--that's a relief.
I'm proud of you, humphrey.
You really shook it up.
Yeah.
Did you get charlie trout's secret in the process? Uh, yeah, yeah.
He thinks he killed his mother.
Bingo! You're gonna have a hell of a story.
Yeah, you know, i'm-- i'm not gonna use it, though.
What do you mean? Well, if i have to exploit people to be a good writer, then, you know, maybe-- maybe i'm not a good writer.
I don't--i'd rather be safe than use people for art.
Harris was right when he cut you loose.
You'll always be second-rate.
Maybe, maybe, but you know what? I have--i have an idea for a new story.
It's about an egomaniacal, washed-up writer who manipulates his protGE.
It's a classic tale of disillusionment.
Good luck with that.
I'll look for it in "reader's digest.
" i can use it to prop up my pulitzers.
I would like to thank everyone for making the show a spectacular success.
But most of all, i would like to thank jenny humphrey, the sensational jenny humphrey.
Without her hard work and talent, the show literally would not have gone on.
To jenny.
To jenny.
To jenny.
Serena, can we talk? About what? How you tried to publicly humiliate me? You know about the dress.
Yeah, laurel told me.
She said it was an accident.
Clearly, she doesn't know you.
I'm sorry.
I was hurt, okay? Y-you blew off our most beloved tradition.
Just get over it, blair.
Excuse me? My whole life, i have been bending over backwards to pRotect your feelings.
And you know what? It's not my fault you're so insecure.
And i'm sure it's not your fault you're so conceited.
I'm just tired of trying to hold myself back so i don't outshine you.
Oh, my god.
Can you hear the words that are coming out of your mouth? Just the truth.
From now on, i'm gonna be who i am, and if you can support that and not be threatened and competitive, then great.
If not From now on, your privileges consist of bread, water and school.
You can't make me give up my job with eleanor.
Watch me.
Dad, you pursued your music when you were young.
You didn't focus on school, and you got what you wanted for a while.
And i don't want my children repeating my mistakes.
And if your career had taken off, then you wouldn't consider them mistakes.
-And maybe i'm just more - more talented than me? Believe me.
I hope you are.
I hope you become a success at whatever it is you choose, after you finish school.
Well, maybe that's not the path i want.
That you don't care about all the school you've missed? No.
I told her i'm not coming back.
If there's one thing i've learned, it's that there would be no gossip without secrets.
give it a tug you might be brave enough to reveal your secret, only to have it used against you Or someone else's secret might affect you in unexpected ways.
there are some secrets you're only too happy to keep.
Others surface only to be buried away deeper than they were before.
But the most powerful secrets Are the truths you thought you could never reveal, that once spoken, change everything.
but don't worry, beThe brightest stars burn out the fastest, or at least that's what i heard.

Here--your one and only sourceinto the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
Andr?K41Leon talley is ravingabout the finale dress, loved it.
My dress? Is that what you told headmistress queller, that you don't care about all the school you've missed? I told her i'm not coming back.
I tried to write, but there was something in the way.
I couldn't focus.
You'll get no letter of recommendation from me.
The captain is being charged with embezzlement and fraud.
This is an absolute disaster.
Serena is in "women's wear daily.
" i'm just tired of trying to hold myself back so i don't outshine you.
Excuse me? From now on, i'm gonna be who i am.

Gossip girl here.
We all have dreams-- some good, some bad,some fun and freudian Morning, miss blair.
And some are the dreams we've had our whole lives.
Dorota, can you believe that in just three short hours, i'll be stepping through the gates of yale? You used to sleep in your father's sweatshirt every night until it fell apart.
I'll get a new one, right after i attend the dean of admissions' private reception, of course.
Most candidates think it's an urban legend, but daddy was invited when he visited.
Your mother already left for work, but she was very specific about your breakfast.
Some kombucha, miss blair? Since the dean handpicks the guests right after their interviews, i'm a shoo-in.
If there's one thing i know, it's that i give good interview.
I could make larry king cry.
I am so proud of you.
And i'm so ready to be surrounded by people more like me and less like Her.
You've got to be kidding me.
Ready? Oh, yeah.
Um, i'm all packed up.
You excited, me at your alma mater? So i guess that means you turned down this, uh, personal invitation to tour yale? Brown's always been my plan, just like it was for you.
And i loved it there, but if yale had invited me, i would have said yes.
The, uh, invitation is handwritten, serena, in cursive.
Yale is for overachieving bookworms and preppies-- the blairs of the world.
Even though the two of us aren't exactly on speaking terms, there's no way i would step on that particular land mine.
Miss serena and you are still not speaking? Not a word in a week, though i can't seem to escape her.
Ever since my mother's show, manhattan has turned into serenaville.
I heard marc jacobs named a purse after her.
Well, i simply don't understand the fascination.
Fortunately, yale is out of her reach.
It's okay, serena.
You don't have to hide the photo.
I've seen it.
I'm sorry they called you my unidentified friend.
Well, i guess it's better than "mother.
" what's in the bag? It's my dress for the fall dinner at the frick.
Eleanor sent them over.
I don't know why there's two.
This one's a little edgier than i thought, but i like it.
Apparently it's for me.
Oh, this must be mine.
It is a really nice color, though.
Dad, what do you think of this color? Of the paper? It's white.
No, no, no.
It's not white.
It's soft ecru.
This is--that's white.
Don't worry.
You'll be fine.
More than fine.
You're the perfect yale candidate.
Maybe, but i-i can't help thinking that yale is for presidents, not humphreys.
As the man who cursed you with the humphrey moniker I didn't say "cursed.
" "cursed" would be cruel.
I now feel compelled to give a speech.
Daniel, my son, you have near perfect grades, excellent s.
A.
T.
S, more talent than money could ever buy.
Yeah, but After that, you find a "but"? What if it's not enough? If that's not enough, then there's something wrong with yale, not you.
Thanks, dad.
All right, well, i'm--i'm off.
It's just me, the best english department in america and a hundred other highly competitive extremely nervous, wannabe yalies.
Get excited, archibald.
We are three hours away from horny women's studies majors wanting to work out all their anger towards men in their bunk beds.
My heart's still set on u.
S.
C.
I-i just wish my mom wouldn't push yale so hard.
I think she's only pushing it 'cause the vanderbilt side of her family practically owns it.
Think of it this way.
Yale is your safety school.
I mean, i guess i could get away from all the drama on the other side of my family and go someplace where they don't know me or the captain.
We blow off the formal visit crap and focus on what really matters-- creating your own freshman 15.
are you not seriously considering going to yale either? I'm, uh, evaluating colleges based on secret societies.
Yale has the crMe de la crme, the skull and bones.
My goal is to get inside their inner sanctum.
And how exactly are you planning to do that? By showing up.
This weekend concludes college visits.
The schools you will be visiting-- harvard, yale and brown -- are among the best in the world.
You are ambassadors of constance billard and st.
Jude's, as well as your own families.
We urge you to present yourselves in the best possible light.
Good luck.
I wonder what lucky school will be the subject of the next nursery rhyme penned by brooklyn's lamest fiction writer? Actually, chuck, i think the dean of admissions at yale will actually appreciate my ability to write about, uh, damaged characters.
Looks like we'll be spending the weekend together.
How nice.
Say hello to the characters on public transportation for me.
Hey.
So you're off to yale? Your @eductive reasoning skills are perfect for a place like brown.
A place like brown? An enclave of trustafarians and children of celebrities who major in drum circles and semiotics, whatever that is.
I can't wait for you to come home next thanksgiving a militant veganista, anemic and proud.
Brown is an ivy league school.
Everyone knows that the only real ivies are the holy trinity -- harvard, yale and princeton.
I know you may find this hard to believe, but not everyone wants to go to yale because not everyone wants to be blair waldorf.
Not everyone can be.
Since we're not friends anymore, let me speak frankly.
You're not that smart.
You lack focus and discipline.
Charm is all well and good, but in the real world, knowledge is power.
You wouldn't make it past the first round of admissions at yale, no matter how hard you tried.
Have fun in providence.
Oh, and, you know, maybe you can get your hair dreadlocked while you're there.
Gossip girl's hardly a war buff, but i did cramfor a quiz or two on the american revolution.
The last time new haven was invaded was in 1779.
hey, mom.
Change of plans.
Tell the driver we're going to yale.
Heads up, b.
There's a cannonball coming your way.
Oh, after that shower, there won't be any hot water left in the building.
I wasn't in the shower the whole time.
I was waiting for something.
I got here as fast as i could.
I know.
I, uh, saw you runningrom my win ? what's going on here? Did you know that vanessa's applying for n.
Y.
U.
Next fall? Something you wouldn't be able to do without finishing high school.
Which she's doing by homeschooling.
Which she has to do because she has to work to support herself.
Living as an adult when you're a teenager is not something any parent wants for their child.
Well, what about what i want for me? Well, until you're 18, what you want gets trumped by what i want.
Plan "b.
" come to the atelier with me today.
Come with you? I'll make you a deal.
Spend the day with me, and by the end of the day, if you honestly think that i should go back to constance on monday, i will.
Jenny, i've seen all your designs, heard about your internship all summer long.
What more is there? Well, things are different now.
Well, at least we'll be moving forward in one way or another.
It's a deal.
You mean it? You have my word.
Thank you! We hear there's nothing like yale in october--the crisp air, the turning leaves,the invasion of prospective freshmen.
Better hurry up, lonely boy.
Your future's waiting.
To summarize, i-i really feel that i have something to say.
Well, by all means, say it.
Via my writing.
Uh, with--with its world-class english department, yale would be the ideal place for me to grow as a--as a writer, to--to flourish and, uh, thrive.
Kudos to you and your inner thesaurus, mr.
Humphrey, but there's a problem withour application.
A-a-a pr--no, there's um, i double--i triple-checked it.
It seems you only have one letter of recommendation from j.
L.
Hall.
Noah shapiro declined to write on your behalf.
Um, mr.
Shapiro and i had creative differences, but--but if you look further down my application, you'll see that i spent the summer interning with jeremiah harris.
A fact which mr.
Harris has not been able to confirm himself.
Oh, um, did you--did you call him early in the morning? 'Cause he's not-- he's not a-a morning person.
I meanhe's not an afternoon person either.

  If you try, like, after 7
0- mr.
Humphrey, if you want your application to stand out, you need another letter, one about your work.
Another letter from whom and how? This is yale.
If you haven't noticed, we traffic in brick buildings full of professors.
I suggest you put on your walking shoes, head to E english department and find someone to read your work.
I thought we were gonna do something.
What happened to your master plan, finding the skull and bones? You don't find them.
They find you.
Hmm.
That's good.
So we'll just sit here and wait.

  I mean, there's a football game at 1
0 or a tour of the university art gallery at 3:00.
whoa.
Good luck sitting on your ass.
Excuse me.
Can i ask you a question? Oh, my.
The dean hasn't laughed like that in years.
It was an utter delight to meet you, miss van der woodsen.
What a lovely surprise.
Oh, and who doesn't like a surprise? I do hope you enjoy the rest of your visit.
Thank you so much.
Looks like he's ready for you.
Shall we, miss waldorf? I've never been more prepared.
So whatever major you decide on, you can mix up with electives.
Yale's are better than most.
Oh, really? Well, what's your favorite? It's a toss-up between the role of s*x in art and great hoaxes in archaeology.
Those are seriously classes? What school are you here from? St.
Jude's in new york.
St.
Jude's? Then you must know, uh, nate archibald.
I heard he's on campus this weekend.
Why does that name sound familiar? He's the son of howard "the captain" archibald.
We've been talking about him in econ.
The guy's like a modern milken.
Hey, uh, jordan, do you want to show me around campus? I'd love to see it.
Sure, but before i go anywhere with a stranger, i think maybe you should tell me your name.
Oh, my name, of course, um, is dan.
Dan humphrey.
All right.
Chuck bass, heir to bass industries, champion of the legendary lost weekend.
Rumor has it you've slept with more "maxim" covers than john mayer.
And better, i might add.
If our intel's correct, you're our prime candidate from next year's class, but we don't take anything on hearsay.
We need to know firsthand if you're as good as your advertising.
Well, i come prepared.
How about a little private party to kick things off? What do you have in mind? I have to say, your application is most impressive, miss waldorf.
There's just one thing i'd like to know.
Tell me something about you that isn't in that packet.
Oh.
Not in there? Do you like to drive race cars? Can you cook authentic szechuan? The young lady before you told me a delightful story.
She was recently in a fashion show just for fun.
I know i must seem rather traditional compared to that young lady, but isn't tradition what yale is all about? Well, yes, but we've been trying to change that image.
Too stuffy.
So? Well I'm aware i lack some people'seasy grace with strangers, and i don't exactly make you feel li you've known me forever even though we just met.
When i laugh, you might not smile just at the coquettish sound of it.
And i may not be "spontaneous" or "delightful" or "full of surprises," and my hair might not sparkle when it catches the light Everything worth knowing about me is in that folder.
I made sure of it.
Well, isn't there anything else you'd like to ask me? Maybe about what my plans are for tonight? Uh, there's so much to do on campus.
I'm sure you'll find something.
It was so nice to meet you.
Right.
Uh, good luck then.
Great hoaxes in archaeology-- is that even a class? What are you doing, serena? Oh, these lovely people were just showing me the course catalog.
No, here.
Yale.
Yale is mine.
Well, i'll admit, i came to punish you for the things you said to me this morning.
Fine.
Consider me punished.
You can go home now.
I actually like it here.
The campus is beautiful, the people are so nice, and do you know how great the drama school is? Of course i do.
It's world-renowned.
The dean made me realize that by being so set on brown, i closed myself off to all other options.
Well, that's a lovely epiphany.
I'm afraid it's irrelevant.
It's not as if you'd actually get in here.
Hello? An intimate gathering at the dean's house tonight? I'd be honored.
Thank you.
You were invited to my gathering.
You might want to make other plans.
? Of all the things-- nate My mom The girls at school-- you wouldn't take this from me Because if you do, i swear i will take you down.
I'm not taking anything from you, blair.
I was invited.
And as for taking me down, i'd love to see you try.
When it comes to war,the rule is never retreat, never surrender.
But whoever said that never met the new serena.
Spotted--little jenny humphreyoff her high horseand in high demand.
Did you look at the resort samples? Eleanor wants your opinion.
Oh, no, i didn't, but i'll do that right now.
And we got in the chambray you like.
We need your advice on what patterns they go with.
I didn't realize it was bring your father to work day.
Yes, well, it was jenny's idea to show me why this is so important to her.
Uh-huh.
Do you have a moment? Just.
I gave jenny my word about something this morning, but i'm not sure if i can keep it.
I need your help.
What can i do for you? Fire her.
I will do no such thing.
Fashion is a young person'sareer, and this is jenny's moment.
She's only 15 years old.
The opportunity can wait till she's ready.
Do you remember the dreams you had when you were 15, mr.
Humphrey? What if they all started to come true? Would you have told them to wait? Just make sure they're up for anything.
This crowd can get particular.
Well, i know you're not a geography whiz, but you aware that providence is in rhode island? I don't have time to explain.
I've been invited to the dean's house tonight.
I have to get ready.
The dean's house? N- Nice.
What's your answer to his question? Yes? No, no, no.
"what person, real or imagined, living or dead, would you most like to have dinner with? " the rumor is, if your answer impresses the dean enough, it's gets you on the short list for early admission, or so says blair.
Oh, i should have given my spot to her.
You got invited, and she didn't? You're lucky to be alive.
Yeah, well, i won't be much longer if i don't find an answer fast.
Steal blair's.
She has no use for it anymore.
No.
No, i can't, no matter how good it is.
George sand.
I did not want to know that.
And how do you even know that? Wait.
Why does blair want to go to dinner with some guy named george? A hot girl named george.
She dressed like a man and apparently is the dean's favorite writer.
And i know this because talking with blair about how she's going to get into yale gets her really- - chuck, no.
You just told me two things i never wanted to hear, and one is gonna haunt me for the rest of my life.
okay, before we go any further I have to know something.
Tell me the truth.
As a writer, what do you think of mRquez? MRquez- - um, that's a tough one.
Okay, you're right.
It's too broad.
Let's just talk "cholera.
Very painful.
Um, no, i'm not kidding.
I tried to read it, and i couldn't get through it.
It's ridiculous.
You're funny And sweet.
Not like most writers i meet.
Hello? ? Do i know you? No, i was told by the other t.
A.
S that you work for the chair of the lit department.
Um, can you come back later, maybe? I apologize for hunting you down now, but i'm--i'm desperate.
I need someone to read my work and write a letter before the weekend's out, and i-i was, uh, i was hoping you could help me.
Nate? Um, help you what? Th-that's, uh, that's nate archibald.
No, that's dan humphrey.
N--what? Nate archibald.
Dan humphrey.
No, she was really into me, and next thing i know,she's throwing a book at my head.
Yeah, faulkner.
It looked like a first edition, not that you'd know.
No, what i do know is that you didn't have to mess it up for meright then and there.
Well, what should i have done, watch you continue to screw up my last chance at making a connection in the lit department for pseudonymous s*x? - No, that's not why i did it.
Is it funny for you?Because my future's not a joke.
It's not.
Just let me explain, okay? Look, nate, i'm sure that your life is complicated with--with your family and, um, i don't know, girls, but you can't pretend to be me.
Maybe it's okay to use people like that in your world, but it's not in mine.
Do ever get tired of carrying around that chip on your shoulder, dan? No wonder serena dumped you.
Hello, shirley.
I would like an invitation to the private reception at the dean's house tonight, and yore going to get me one.
I'm sorry.
I'm not in charge of the dean's private affairs.
? ? Interviews are so stressful for you students.
Check your e-mail.
Do you know how rare a pair is from that era? I had someone at christie's put them on hold just in case.
Poor s.
She should know b.
'S rules by now.
When someone leaves you off the list,don't get mad.
Get in.
Thank you.
Well? I'm impressed.
You're clearly valued here.
You handle yourself very professionally.
Thank you.
But I think you should go back to school.
But you just said you were impressed.
I don't I don't understand.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I just think school's too important.
Okay.
If that's what you think, that's what you think.
We made a deal, and i agreed to it, so I have to say, i thought there'd be some yelling.
You said you'd give me a day, and you did.
Can, um, can you at least take me to complete one last eand before we go home? Sure.
Thanks.
Trying to come up with an answer for the dean's parlor game? You manipulated your way in here? I get what i want, serena, just like i'm gonna win tonight.
What's your answer? Oh, no, let me guess.
Lauren conrad.
Try george sand.
Wait.
That's-- your answer? Not anymore.
If you're gonna cheat your way in, then why should i play fair? Oh, and i heard that the dean asks his question in alphabetical order, so since "v" comes before "w," it looks like the answer is all mine.
how kind of you.
you gentlemen wanted a chuck bass party.
Your party has arrived, straight from I can't tell you where they're from actually, but they're the best money can buy.
Before you ask, they don't speak english, and they don't care.
By the way, that's not one for each of you.
They do their best work in threes.
Not bad, bass, but you're not done.
The girls are all right, but they're just girls.
You still need to prove your loyalty.
We want nate archibald.
We know you' tight with him.
We know he's on campus.
Archibald's not worth your time.
We think he is.
My family lost our compound in newport because of his father.
Pull him in.
Take him down.
You've got one hour.
If you want in, you'll bring us archibald.
Aiment-vous les films du lelouch? Oh, j'adore lelouch.
"roman de gare" Tait un de mes films prFRS cet annE.
Et toi? Actually, it's "vous," as a sign of respect.
I'm sure that's why you don't know it very well.
Blair waldorf.
Mademoiselle.
You were my father's favorite teacher.
I'veeen looking for you.
You inspired his expatriation to france.
I'd love for you to hear about it.
Shall we? Oh, oui.
Where have you been? I got tied up.
Hey, look.
You wouldn't want to leave tonight, would you? I mean, i think i am completely done with this place.
Did you strike out? More like abruptly thrown out.
People here know who i am.
They know all the stuff about my dad.
Plus, there was this whole thing with dan humphrey.
Well, i'd love to say, "tell me all about it" and mean it, but since i can't, why don't we just meet up and get blazed? Yeah, yeah, okay.
Hey, look.
There's this place off campus called mike's bar.
I'll meet you there.
Stay put.
Perfect.
It's done.
Let's go.
Although i love henry viii, i prefer sir thomas more.
I think it's great that pope benedict canonized him when he did.
Oh, thank you.
Don't you mean pope pius xi? That's quite right, miss, uh Van der woodsen.
Van der woodsen, is it? Hi.
Most people don't know their popes in succession.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Can i borrow you for a minute? How do you even know that? You slept through history class last year.
I love "the tudors.
" henry cavill is a total babe.
You look pretty calm for someone who no longer has the perfect answer to the dean's question.
You don't think i came all the way here without a backup answer, do you? Oh, and it's a real crowd-pleaser.
It's gonna kill.
Everyone.
It's time for my favorite part of the evening, which has delightfuhly become known over the years as probatur.
That's latin for "the quiz.
" we will begin with mr.
Applebaum.
And now on to miss Steinberg.
Your anwer is artemis.
Artemis is the goddess of the forests and the hills.
As a freegan, i believe in all living things being equal to all people.
I'm so glad they did this alphabetically, 'cause now i get to see the look on your face when i use your answer even sooner.
I can tell you right now, And also screw the man at the same time.
Very nice, miss steinberg.
Uh, now on to miss van der woodsen.
The person you would most like to have dinner with, real or imagined, living or dead is Pete fairman.
Uh I do not know this person.
Who is pete fairman? Um He, uh, he He's He's the man she killed.
? Why? It's not like you don't deserve it.
Miss van der woodsen, would you like to, uh, explain? No, of course, dean berube.
Um, pete fairman was a man that i knew.
Man/dealer.
Miss waldorf, let her speak.
He died almost two years ago when i was with him.
What happened was a tragedy, and i am filled with regret over it, but i was not responsible-- were you responsible for the s*x tape? Blair.
It wasn't very sexy, if you ask me.
Blair, that's enough.
Let's go.
Dean berube, do you mind if we, um, sort this out privately, please? Take all the time you need.
My answer was george sand.
Love her, idolize, worship! Get your hands off of me! Or are you trying to kill me, too? A guy died, and you use it as part a game.
Who does that? It isn't a game, and this isn't just another thing on a laundry list.
This is yale, my dream.
You crossed the line.
And so did you when you brought up pete! As far as my being here, you take that up with the school.
You did not just do that.
Why did you think you were invited? You know on paper you're not yale material.
Could it be your face on "page six," your name everywhere? Face it, serena.
Yale needs to up their "q" rating, just like all the other schools, and they're gonna use girls like you to do it.
You shut up! You shut up! Aah! No! Blair! And i really hate those stupid headbands.
Aah! My headband! Aah! You--aah! No! You! Oh! Aah! Are you sure it's okay for us to just come up here like this? Yeah.
The maid's expecting me.
Larissa? Whose maid is larissa exactly? You didn't say where we were going.
Jenny.
Lily's not here.
I didn't think you'd mind.
Rufus.
Whoa.
Oh, um This is not my dress.
I was just trying it on For fun.
Sorry.
When i called, um, larissa said you were going out tonight, and i could leave this with her.
I forgot to include it in the garment bag with your dress.
Oh.
But clearly, um, i don't even think you need it.
Uh, this dress looks so great on you.
The only thing wrong is the shoes.
I can totally go pick you out a different pair if you want.
Oh, upstairs, third door on the left.
Okay.
How have you been? Fine.
Sorry for the intrusion.
Oh.
It's no bother.
I'm always happy to see you.
Uh The house seems quiet.
Well, bart is out of town, serena and charles are on college visits, and eric has a new friend, so i hear.
Well, the place looks amazing, as do you.
It's quite a dress.
Of course it is.
Your daughter made it.
You're so lucky to have a daughter that's this good at what she wants to do so early in her life.
It's a gift.
You had one, too, if i remember correctly.
Here you go.
The perfect pair of jimmyhoos.
I will lend these to serena when she wears the dress.
Okay.
Jenny, we should get going.
Okay.
See you.
Bye.
By the way, no matter what you wear, you look fantastic.
Hey, man.
Where are you? I've been sitting here forever.
Please, just call me back.
A round of shots, mike.
Coming right up, guys.
We just taught nate archibald a lesson, and he'll never come back to yale.
Yeah, archibald's such a loser.
Excuse me.
Did you say "nate archibald"? Yeah, we just tied that chump to the statue in the gazebo.
It's priceless.
I hope he freezes his ass off.
Well, you got the wrong guy.
I'm nate archibald, and i look forwardto coming here next year and kicking your ass.
In fact, why wait? Okay, it can wait.
Go! Get him! Come on! Hey, excuse me.
Excuse me.
Uh, hi.
Um, i know this is a strange request, but could you untie me? Sir.
Hey.
Yeah.
Hey.
Come on.
Hey.
Excuse me.
Would you be so kind as to, uh Dan? I hope you at least bought the statue a drink first.
No, you know, i don't know if i want you to help me.
Well, you might, if you knew that the only reason you're here is because they thought you were me.
How is that even possible? I-i didn't lie about my name.
Yeah, but i have a feeling someone else did for you.
Why would anyone want to hurt, uh, mr.
Perfect nate archibald? Apparently my legacy at yale involves a lot of people hating my father's guts.
It turns out he killed a few trust funds around here.
By the way, this knot is ridiculous.
Yeah, i know.
Could you, uh, could you try a little faster? 'Cause i see something approaching that looks female.
I'm not entirely proud of my choice of boxers.
You two again? Yeah.
Hi.
Is this performance art piece your new plan to get my attention? Uh, w-would-- would it work if it was? Move over.
My mom was in the navy.
Oh, my god.
I can't do it anymore, blair.
That's because you almost lost.
I had you pinned with that chicken wing.
Don't deny it.
I don't mean this.
I mean everything-- the wars, the betrayal, the watching out for every possible land mine.
It's exhausting.
I'm sick of it, too.
I'm sick of always looking like darth vader next to sunshine barbie.
Life's too short.
? Well, if that's how we really feel, may--maybe we shouldn't be friends.
? So we might as well just start now, right? Fine by me.
You live your life.
I'll live mine.
Sounds great.
I agree.
From comrades to combat, we thought we'd seen it all, but we've never seen this--serena and blair calling a cease-fire.
After so much scorched earth, can either side claim victory? Why do i feel like you're gonna tell me the cat died? No, no.
It's nothing bad.
Uh, when i was your age, all i wanted was to be a musician, but my parents didn't think it was a good idea, and it made for some pretty uncomfortable years.
And last night, i realized that-- that we don't have to do things that way.
I don't understand.
Your dad asked me to bring over all my stuff on homeschooling.
Aah! After christmas, we can reevaluate.
Aah! And if everything works out, maybe you'll apply to the professional children's school for next semester.
Like vera wang.
Aah! Thank you.
Aw! I won't let you down.
I promise.
I know you won't.
What are you doing here, making sure the dean knows it's all my fault? No.
I came to tell him that yale is your dream, and you deserve to go here more than i do.
What are you doing here? Doing the same thing for you.
I was up all night thinking about the first time we came here together when we were 9.
your dad took us to that harvard/yale game, and you tackled senator schumer's daughter for wearing a harvard sweatshirt.
I bet those grass stains never came out.
I don't want to not know you.
I can't not know you.
Maybe we just had that fight because the reality of being separated next year is just too scary to think about.
So? Wait here for me.
We'll ride home together.
Okay.
So you think you can, uh, maybe help him out a bit? Well, i can't promise anything, but i'm pretty sure i can get someone in the department To read these and write you a recommendation.
Thank you so much, really.
It's so nice to know that my dream of going to yale isn't dead.
It might be, uh, embarrassed and humiliated, but not dead.
And i'm sorry about ling to you.
I just needed to be someone else for a while.
Yeah, well, next time you're up here, why don't you just be yourself? Okay.
Yeah.
I would have liked you whatever your name was.
Bye, dan.
Bye.
You know what? - You--you do dan humphrey better than dan humphrey.
Really? That, uh, that thousand yard squint--can i steal that? Well, thank you.
Here he is.
It looks like someone messed up last night.
You sent us after the wrong guy.
He may have been the wrong guy for you, but he was the right guy for me.
You'll pay for this when you get here next year.
Oh, i'm not coming here next fall.
Those girls i brought to the party last night? They witnessed some pretty incriminating acts with their lipstick cameras.
You may be the future leaders of america.
You're now under the control of chuck bass.
I own you.
Keep it.
I've got plenty.
Missed you last night.
Did you? Or was it your plan all along just to get me out of the way? What? I know what you did.
You should be glad.
Those guys were coming for you.
I saved your ass.
You didn't have to send them after dan.
Two birds, one stone.
Seemed good to me.
Besides, since when do you care about humdrum humphrey anyway? He's nothing.
He's less than nothing.
I actually think he's pretty cool.
We'll talk about this in the car.
No, i think--i think i'd rather take the train.
So the dean seemed inscrutable to you, too? I don't think he even blinked.
Well, since we're probably both gonna end up at hunter after what happened, i think we ought to say a proper good-bye.
Hello? Serena, dean berube.
Oh, hello, sir.
I just thought you should know that despite events at last night's reception, i-i remain most impressed with you, and come time for early acceptances in december, i'd check that list to see if your name was on it.
Okay, but what about blair? Well, like all the other students with blair's qualifications, she will learn her fate in the spring.
If it's all right with you, i'd like to issue a press release that you came up to visit our glorious campus.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
I won't accept.
I can't, like this.
What? No, you have to.
It doesn't matter how you got it or why.
It's an opportunity.
No, you're my best friend.
What's mine is yours.
You can't share this.
? Dreams--everybody has them--some good, some bad Some you wish you could forget Sometimes you realize you've outgrown them Sometimes you feel like they're finally coming true And some of usjust have nightmares.
But no matter what you dream,when morning comes, reality intrudesand the dream begins to slip away.
Dream a little dream of me.
Gossip girl here, Your one and only source Into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
gossip girl was right.
I'm gay Every time mom brought home someone who said, "i love you," They would end up married.
I'm not ashamed of who I am.
I may have concealed thing In the past, but not anymore.
The bad news is that your girlfriend Catherine i A lying, manipulating whore who's sleeping with her stepson.
The good news is that I convinced them both To leave town.
what do you care about Humdrum Humphrey anyway? he's nothing I actually think he's pretty cool.
the only person With fewer friends than you is Dan Humphrey, and that's There's nothing quite like autumn in new york, But it's not only the leaves that change.
Something in the air brings out the true colors in everyone.
Why are you all so quiet? Good morning.
Bart, you're back early.
my last round of meetings Wrapped up sooner than expected.
rushing home to the family.
How long's this layover? Didn't Lily tell you? I'm here for the long haul.
And just in time for our housewarming party Tomorrow night.
um, I've been meaning to ask you.
Uh, can we bring friends? of course, dear.
Oh, um, did you get the little suit that I laid out for you, Serena? that was for me? I thought the housekeepers got new uniforms.
Yeah, it's conservative, yes, but classic.
Bart brought it from paris.
it had its own seat on his plane.
Bart bought me a suit? new watch.
Cash--direct deposit into one of my offshore accounts.
Now that we are all here, Lily and I have something we want to discuss.
As tomorrow's party marks our debut as a family, We've been talking about what that actually means.
Less money for me when you die? We were thinking more along the lines of some guidelines.
Guidelines? for what? For life together.
I mean, now that we're all here, Having some rules would be nice.
like what? Like every friday, we dine as a Family.
uh, don't you think monday would be- A weekend curfew of 1:00 a.
m.
is that eastern or pacific? And no going out on school nights.
what? Are you serious? all right, all right.
Mom, where is this coming from? Bart and me.
we made the decision together We are in complete agreement on this matter.
yeah, I'm sure.
Medicine cabinet, bedside table, underwear drawer? It's borderline solicitation, v.
, and--and, uh, creepy.
It wouldn't be creepy if you'd Actually read the flyer.
you're on a missio To save dutch schultz's favorite speakeasy.
But what are you protesting? the--the owner died, didn't he? He did, which is why the whole building's up for auction.
And if we don't stop the sale, it won't be long before Some evil developer turns it into a pain quotidien.
oh, I like le pain-- Okay, we're doing a petition for landmark status uh, which you signed And dad signed and mom signed And--and Eleanor Waldorf.
how about I come to school with you And hand out flyers to the guilty rich? well, if there is such a thing, I d--i don't think there's any in my school.
Well, maybe one of their mommies or daddie Is looking for their next cause.
hmm.
Whose bag is that? that's a soccer ball.
oh, Yeah, apparently, half the soccer team at st jude' Got mono from making out with lauren goldenberg ew.
So i-i guess their only other option was to ask me to try out.
Wait.
they asked you? Yeah, well, Nate did.
I'm now an alterNate.
I'm also really, really late.
Uh, you with me? Yeah.
Well, uh, good luck with the guiltless rich.
What's next, no tv until after you finish Your homework? they're just a few rules, Serena Who watches tv on a tv anymore anyway? It's not about the rules, Eric.
it's about mom.
When it's just the three of us, it's fine, But anytime she gets a new guy, she stepfords out And lets him make all the decisions.
I don't think that's what's happening Remember when we had to move to chamonix Because german Klaus wanted to ski all year round? that wasn't so bad.
But what about paolo-- The raw food diet? family colonics? Or sameer? I know I enjoyed our brief conversion to islam.
I see what you mean.
look, Mom can't let these guys choose her life for he Because they shouldn't be able to choose ours.
It seems different this time.
She seems pretty serious About making the whole family thing work with Bart.
We could at least try, right? fine.
But the second he starts to call the shots, These gloves come off and the nails come out.
I just mixed metaphors, didn't i? yeah, but it kind of worked.
And the coach is really impressed with your tryouts.
really? Yeah.
thanks for subbing in.
well, Save your thanks until after you see me play It's gonna be-- Humphrey, never a pleasure.
Oh, good.
we agree on something.
Archibald, Isn't it about time you ended this bromance What happens at yale stays at yale.
Hey, man.
let's go.
Poor Chuck.
what is life without a friend to share it? Oh, it looks like you just lost yours to Dan Humphrey.
Who cares? I'd rather talk about who you lost yours to anyway.
Been there, done that, been decontamiNated.
We both know you'll do it again.
it's just a question of when.
The answer is never.
We're inevitable, Waldorf.
Despite whatever vestigial attraction My body may feel for you, my brain knows better.
And yours should, too.
I gotta go.
I've got a disciplinary hearing.
well, I knew you were trouble, but a hearing Impressive.
Oh, it's not for me.
Kelsey, Kelsey, Kelsey, how many times must we tell you? As one of the girls of the steps, You represent constance royalty.
so it should come as no surprise That many girls before you have gotten the ax When their choices reflected poorly on us.
I didn't realize-- that tights are not pants? Honestly.
Blair, you got a minute? What are you doing here with those? Shouldn't you be at whole foods? As much as I hate these words coming out of my mouth, I could really use your help with this.
oh, saving a teardown.
Charity is for diseases and enDangered species.
Real estate is not on the list, at least not in new york.
I can make you help me, you know? Oh, it makes jokes, too.
Everyone knows that you and Marcus broke up, But no one knows why.
Even you wouldn't stoop that low.
Blackmail seems to work so well for you, So maybe I'm missing out.
Now that we've established that I own you, You have six hours to get a thousand signatures And make sure they're legible.
have fun.
Well, well.
look who's playing by the rules, And it's not even a school night.
Eric convinced me.
what about you? I'm on my way out to a house call.
Ugh.
gross.

  Well, as long as you're home by 1
0.
Naive Serena.
Don't you know Bart and lil's list of rules doesn't apply to me? What are you talking about? according to my sources, The real reason my father flew back early Is to court some executives in town from the midwest.
The only problem is, they won't do business With anyone who doesn't share their family values, So Bart is making sure we do Or appear to.
Wait.
all this just so he can close a deal? I do my best work off the radar, But while you're on "Page Six" With the Poppy Liftons of the world, You're the bigger threat to Bart's business.
Night, sis.
I hope your book is captivating.
Hi, Bart.
We missed you at family dinner.
maybe next time.
Where do you think you're going, and in that dress? Oh, the girls and I thought we'd hit up 1oak, then maybe Bijoux, And I don't know--anywhere we can find some paparazzi.
I'm in the mood for a little show tonight.
Oh, I forgot to put on underwear.
Waving a white flag, are we? Not exactly.
I have a proposition for you.
I'll say yes.
that little troll Vanessa is working my last nerve.
Not what I expected.
and then I realized this could benefit both of us.
You had me until "troll.
" Dan stole your best friend.
now you can steal his.
Seduce and destroy.
What's in it for me? the thrill of the impossible.
The only person Vanessa loathes more than me is you.
It would be one for the ages.
Maybe you're not up for it.
If memory serves, you've had some mechanical problems.
I'll just imagine she's you.
This just in Blair Waldorf and Chuck Bass Placing a wager on the takedown of lonely boy's b.
f.
f.
We think we've heard this sTory before, And we're pretty sure it ended up with everyone dead.
So what did Lily have to say About last night's curfew flaunting? I kind of snuck out before she could corner me Let them discipline the sibling that actually deserves it.
you mean Chuck? What? you smiled.
No, I didn't.
I hate Chuck.
don't make me lose my appetite.
Oh, hey.
is that Eric? Hey, uh, Larissa said you'd be here.
Hey.
and we are? who is this? Jonathan, this is my sister, Serena, And her friend, Blair Waldorf.
This is Jonathan, my boyfriend.
It's nice to meet you both.
nice work, e.
Oh, my gosh.
hi.
so nice to meet you.
Sit down, both of you.
I invited him to the party tonight, But I thought you should meet him first.
yeah, I met Chuck the other day.
Chuck.
wow.
hear that, Blair? Chuck.
Ignore her.
she's dehydrated.
Did I miss something? no, but we did-- The sTory of how you two met.
We want to know everything.
so then the ball came to me And so I kicked it to this guy, and then--and then, you know, He kicked it to another guy, an he kicked it to another guy And then that guy scored, So, you know, it was basically an assist.
Yeah, it was awesome.
it was pretty amazing.
Oh, it's so weird that you're on a team now I mean, pretty soon you're gonna have Actual guy friends.
what are you talking about I have plenty of guy friends.
Dan, I know that you're mr.
soccer now, But you and I both know you prefer to hang out with girls.
Vanessa, Serena, once upon a time.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
except that it's completely untrue.
Okay.
dad, will you please tell Jenny that--that I have guy friends? Of course he does.
I'm his-- no, not including you.
Or cedric? not including dolls.
Okay, watch and learn.
Nate.
hey, man.
hey, it's Humphrey.
Dan.
Yeah, good.
good.
hey, listen.
Uh, you want to hook up for some soccer later? You're--you're-- you're by the park, right? Noon, yeah.
sweet, bro.
all right.
I love it.
bye.
Apparently, uh, we're gonna play soccer later.
Uh-huh.
no big.
Is cedric invited? Jenny.
Hmm.
come on.
Thank you, dad.
you know, cedric would get dirty.
Then Dan would have beaten them All right, I'll see you two later.
I got my boy waiting for me.
Great turnout, v.
I got a good feeling.
Let's hope so, Horace.
Here come the sharks.
What the hell are you doing? you mean you have to ask? I'm here because of you.
thank you for introducing me To this unique business opportunity.
no.
Unh-unh.
you are not buying this plac To turn it into another yuppie fusion bar.
For your information, since I bought Victrola, Bass industries has expanded into vintage entertainment.
We're willing to work with you.
thanks, But we're already petitioning for landmark status Why don't you have a bake sale while you're at it? In the real world, we are your only hope.
Endorse our bid, and we promise to return this place To all its sweet sordidness.
It sounds perfect.
just one problem--i know you.
Or do you only think you do? hey, get outta here, rich boy! Ooh! wow.
I didn't think that suit could get any worse.
I was wrong.
I think that's-- oh, Serena, wait a minute.
Would you excuse us, please? thank you.
so what's my punishment? Don't be childish.
why not? you're treating me like one.
Isn't that who curfews are for? well, You're certainly living up to our expectations According to Bart You went out looking like a stripper last night.
If you have a problem with our rules, then just say so, But to simply defy us not you, him.
Bart and I are husband and wife.
but he's not our father.
Come on, mom.
Things were so good last year.
We were almost like a real family.
Why change that? Serena, you're making this Much more complicated than it really is, And going by your actions last night, I clearly think that you could benefit from a little structure.
If I thought this was actually you talking, I might listen.
If this is how you're acting now, I should have insisted on more structure years ago.
You mean, like, three husbands ago? That was unkind.
I'm not really in a family mood.
I think I'm gonna pass on tonight's little soiree.
Nate? Hey, man.
Oh, right, yeah, yeah, we're meeting in the park.
Yeah.
No, no, no.
I just-- I got--i got tied up.
Yeah, I'll see you in ten.
Okay.
Whoever said, "you can't have it all," Must have known the Archibalds.
Looks like poor little Nate is Yuck.
poor.
A mr.
Chuck to see you, miss Blair.
Dorota, who? Excuse me.
don't you-- Deal's off.
what? what are you talking about? I'm out.
I don't know what I was thinking about, Pretending to buy some broken-down Bar.
but you promised to seduce vanessa She needs to be destroyed.
She's your problem.
humphrey doesn't warrant this.
The great chuck bass is just gonna give up? No, no, no.
there's no shame if the prize isn't worth it.
You can do your own dirty work.
There's not enough in it for me.
But what if I made it worth it? What are you talking about? I think you know.
You're not serious.
My, my.
That girl has gotten under your skin.
The question is, bass, will you? Aren't you the least bit worried I'll succeed? Do we have an agreement? Careful, b.
One thing about making a deal with the devil Oh, we have a deal.
He always comes to collect.
After you left, Your lawyer came back and showed us your proposal, Which did indeed include keeping everything as is And lobbying for landmark status.
so I was telling the truth.
I'm sure you've done something in your lifetime To deserve getting bean ed by an iced beverage.
Isn't it possible there are parts of me you don't know? Possible, just extremely unlikely.
You have a reason for coming here? If it was to insult me, there's a website you can go to the manager of the inn wants to meat you If you sign off,you have our support It still doesn't mean I trust you Of course not Now I'd better put on something special I don't know how she expect to take this family seriously when her record stands at 16 months Which one has the power with that klaus.
you say someone who wore the wedding shoes zip No, that was danish claus, with a "c.
" This is german klaus, with a "k.
" Wait, I forget.
did she marry both? no, just german klaus, But she did date danish claus longer.
oh, your mother.
Remember how she always used to just jet off To mustique or ibiza without warning While you and eric were still in school? eleanor always knew When we showed up with our overnight bags.
lily had a new boyfriend.
We tried alternating between you and the archibalds So you guys never knew how bad it really was.
we knew.
But bart is the worst.
he's controlling and a hypocrite.
He acts like he's family friendly When he's dated half the models in manhattan.
B.
, you look gorgeous.
where did you get that dress? Oh, this? Just chuck.
When did chuck give you a dress? when we were going to europe.
And you're wearing it tonight? It's just that it would be a shame to waste it.
that's all.
uh-huh.
You know, you gotta teach me that--that, uh, That bouncing-off-the-knees thing, 'cause I tried it once, but I broke my dad's gibson.
It's very scarring to see your father cry.
well, I actually wouldn't know.
My father--not too big on showing emotion.
mm.
Hey, so I'm guessing you're not going To the bass/van der woodsen housewarming party, Are you, tonight? no, no.
Um, well, especially since this is the first I'm hearing of it.
Oh, so you and serena are, like well, to say things ended badly Would be an understatement.
you going? Uh, nah.
I think I'm just gonna stay at home, Chill out, watch a movie, you know? yeah, that sounds good.
Well, I'd actually invite you over, But the house is, like, a total mess.
oh, yeah.
no.
Housekeeper has the week off, so Is your mom there? I mean, not that she cleans things You know, i-i-i don't know All that stuff with your dad yeah.
no, it's, uh.
.
My mom's staying out in the hamptons okay.
So I told her I was staying at chuck's just so she doesn't Worry about stuff, you know? I'm gonna get a drink, actually.
you want something? Yeah.
sure.
thanks.
cool.
What is it? Nothing.
I like it.
This our guy? Horace rogers, meet chuck bass.
pleasure.
Man, come here.
Look at that outfit.
Didn't know it could be worse than the one this morning.
Kidding.
I know savile row when I see it.
joe kennedy taught me.
You knew joe kennedy? used to come here all the time.
Had a girl up the street.
I was 9 years old, selling papers out front.
Rumor has it He kept this place in booze during prohibition.
So you like old joe? Rumrunner, womanizer, millionaire.
He was my kind of guy.
They all used to come here back in the day-- Gangsters, fighters, musicians.
Dangerous folks, no doubt.
But they had style.
Something tells me you'd fit right in.
That's possibly the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.
Well, are you sure he's living there? Uh, squatting, I think, would be the correct term.
There's just, like, A sleeping bag and a bunch of brooks brothers shirts.
Why isn't he staying with chuck? well, obviously, dan, he's embarrassed.
Okay, look, invite him over for dinner tonight.
Dad's making chili.
and then once he's here, We can convince him to stay.
okay.
uh, Don't--don't mention anything to dad, though 'cause he'll probably, like, handcuff him to the couch Or say something stupid.
I'll see ya.
That was, uh, that was jenny.
oh.
And it turns out my dad's making his once-a-year chili, And attendance is mandatory for me and whoever I'm with.
I'm sorry.
I'm deeply sorry.
but this year, that's you.
Wow.
well, I guess I don't have a choice then, do i? You don't.
Uh, scattegories will be involved.
scattegories? Be prepared.
it's been a while.
Hey, jonathan.
you visiting eric? uh, he's not here.
I was just dropping off some books.
Have fun tonight.
uh, you're not coming No.
eric talked to your stepfather, And apparently it's family only.
Wait, bart said that? it's no big deal.
I'll see you later.
Well, you won horace over.
He trusts me.
You're really serious, aren't you? You're gonna save this place.
Yeah.
I guess I am.
I knew it'd take a miracle, But I never thought it would be chuck bass.
I was wrong about you, And I'm sorry.
Thanks.
means a lot.
Vanessa, there's something En route to J Sisters.
How's it going At the conclusion of a deal, I like to celebrate.
My parents are having a housewarming tonight.
I'd like you to come.
yeah, okay.
Good.
I'll send the car at 8:00.
Richard phillips, this is Ariel foxman and honor brodie from "in style.
" Everything here that you see is thanks to them.
Except for this gorgeous painting, Which richard did.
Um, would you just excuse us for one second? I'll take care of it, lily.
excuse me.
Serena? The suit looks lovely on you.
And I'm glad you changed your mind and decided to join us.
Can I introduce you to some people? no, I'm waiting on some friends.
We are allowed to bring friends, right? sure.
Bart, just curious.
Does mom know you told eric he couldn't bring his boyfriend? I told eric no such thing.
We discussed it.
the decision was his.
Really? the 15 year old and the billionaire? Sounds like a discussion between equals.
Serena, I hope that over time You'll see that I want what's best for this family.
In the meantime, I suggest you talk with your brother.
Good evening, chuck.
Blair.
Do I get a progress report? Does vanessa still think You're buying that beer hall of hers? I am buying it.
it's a good investment.
You're kidding.
Fine.
but you're still gonna crush her, right? We made a deal, remember? Yes.
excuse me.
Some housewarming.
Good thing I didn't bring a casserole.
Can I get you a drink? chuck.
I'd like to speak with you now.
I'll be back in a moment.
So, jenny, I still can't believe You dropped out of constance to become a designer.
Um, it's incredible how supportive my dad's been.
By "incredible," she means "difficult to believe.
" what about you, nate? How's everything at home? I know it's been a tough year.
yeah, it has, But, you know, we're getting by.
it's just you and your mom now? Uh, you know, I've seen nate do that knee bounce thing With the soccer ball, and it's--it's amazing.
Well, my mom's actually out at our hamptons house, But I still have school, so I gotta--i gotta stick around.
You staying by yourself? isn't that kind of lonel Well, yeah, but, I mean I grew up there.
You know, it's where all the memories are.
Do you know what this is about? to show me lily's poliform kitchen? I love what it does with the doors.
Did you really think I wasn't gonna find out My company was buying a bar in brooklyn? it wasn't a secret.
I just wanted to make sure I had everything in place.
Did you read the proposal? why would I do that? Because the tax break wi be huge.
Saving a landmark buys us amazing p.
r.
, Engenders goodwill in the community, Paving the way for future investment.
Plus, it's a great place.
Look, father, let me take you there and show you around.
I'll make you a believer, I promise.
what I believe Is that you've betrayed my trust and wasted my time.
This is a good move for bass indusies.
I stand behind it.
really? chuck bass stands behind it.
what's that worth? I gave people my word.
they're counting on me.
Well, luckily, letting people down is your forte.
Oh, man.
This has been great.
bu look, I should go.
Look, i, uh, I'm tired, so what about scattegories? Oh, I can't believe I just used scattegories as an enticement.
Well, next time.
W--uh, I mean, it's late.
You sure you just don't wanna crash on the couch? nah.
no, it's cool.
Look, uh, nate, i I, uh, i-i know about how you're living at home.
Excuse me.
what? it was a mistake.
I just thought we were supposed to meet at your place today.
But I saw the notice.
wait, so you--so you broke into my home? Well, no.
I mean, there w-- There wasn't really much to break into.
It's just, you know, j-jenny and I wanted to help you.
jenny knows, too? Oh, so suddenly I'm the humphrey family's Favorite charity, huh? no, no, it's not like that No, look, you tell your dad I said thank you, and then I had to leave.
nate-- Dan, we hang out at yale, we played soccer once.
so what? Just stay out of it.
I overheard the end of that conversation.
And I'm sorry.
I don't know your dad, But from What I saw today, you deserve better.
You say that But you don't really know me.
My father, on the other hand, has a lifetime of experience.
The man makes some good points.
Stay.
Please.
Bart told me I could bring jonathan.
But he told me there would be press here, And do I really want to come out in a National magazine? he's worried about his own image I don't think so.
I think he's trying to protect me.
Why--why are you so against him? I don't know.
Excuse me.
serena, eric, would you guys mind If our reporter asked you a few questions? Honestly? sure.
So your mom told me how close-knit your family is.
Is there a particular memory that stands out? A birthday or christmas? she said what? Just that-- um, excuse me.
I just need to--to borrow serena.
You said we were a close-knit family? I'll bring her right back, And I'll tell you all about the wonderful time That we had in mustique.
It was such fun.
don't you mean you and constantine Or did you forget, the same way You forget to say good-bye to me and eric Every time you left? serena, don't do this If you have issues with bart, fine, But don't sabotage this.
what? i-i'm not doing anything I thought we were just sharing memories Of a--what a close family we are.
I remember this one time, um, when I was 11.
Eric and I wanted a white christmas.
Luckily, mom's husband was a raging cokehead, So he left blow everywhere.
oh, my god.
It wasn't everywhere--just on the smooth, shiny surfaces.
Was that, um, german klaus with a "k," Or was it danish claus with a "c"? I can't ever remember which ones she actually married Or which she just decided Were more important than her children.
You know what? I was--i was wrong.
It's not bart at all.
it's you.
Looks like the bass housewarming party Just got a little colder.
Serena's walk down memory lane has her heading out the door.
Bet's off.
But the game's not over.
I'm calling it on account of boredom.
You were right.
vanessa's not worth playing with.
Maybe she is, maybe she isn't.
why the sudden change of heart? Like I said, the whole thing is dull.
Pursuing vanessa is beneath us both.
You think I'm going in for the kill.
You're worried you're gonna Have to go through with what you promised.
I'm not worried about that.
Well, then what? Then nothing.
Just forget it.
I can't believe serena did that in front of everyone-- That reporter, all of these people.
Eric, my darling, you are always honest with me.
It isn't true, is it? I know serena's timing sucked, But she did pretty much raise me all those years.
Oh you just weren't here, you know? I wasn't that bad.
Our ringtone for you was "since u been gone.
" Used to sign our permission slips from school.
Well, there was a lot going on in my life.
And I did the best I could, just like I'm doing now.
Yeah, but now it's like You want us to go from zero to brady in 60 seconds.
We're not there yet.
Oh, I know, but I just thought if-- You don't become a family just by telling people you are.
You become a family because you want to be one.
I--mm.
I think mine's carbonated.
Yours? You're still upset.
Well, like I said, I tried to help him, and then he bailed.
So, you know, if he doesn't want my help, Then that's--that's fine.
And being a friend means giving someone something they need Even when they can't ask for it, which you did.
Right.
i-i did that.
so it also means not giving up on them When they say "no, thank you.
" I didn't do that, and I'm not doing that.
He wants to be alone.
it's his choice.
Good luck to him.
well, From what you told me, this thing is pretty intense I don't know if he has anyone else in his life Looking out for him right now.
You really wanna be his friend, you need to be that person I know I left my bag with my coat.
Could you just check again? no need.
Don't tell me you took my purse by mistake.
Hardly.
But then it wasn't your bag I was after.
Don't you know Never to leave anything that valuable unattended? Oh, and I took the liberty of Increasing your storage space.
what did you do Marcus and catherine are free To live their sick little lives in peace, as am i.
Now that you have nothing on me, you're done here.
Except one more thing.
You may think you've discovered the hidden chuck, But you should know He has no real feelings for you whatsoever.
It was all a little bet we made To see just how gullible you could be.
I don't believe you.
It was simple, really.
Chuck wanted to get dan, and I wanted to get you.
So are you telling me that chuck had his dad's company Make an offer on the brooklyn inn In order to get back at dan? Isn't that a little convoluted, even for the two of you? Real estate was just foreplay.
Seducing and humiliating you was the Ultimate goal.
chuck didn't hit on me once Maybe what's really going on here is that you can't stand That he might actually be a good person When he's not around you.
I seriously doubt that What are you doing, blair? Tying up some loose ends, Telling vanessa that she doesn't mean anything to you.
We were just playing chess, And she was another piece that you needed to knock over On your way to take the queen.
do you disagree? Guess i-i should've known.
Good boy.
what the hell was the point of that? Well, you may not have seduced her, But she seems pretty humiliated to me.
what are you saying? I'm saying I lost, you won.
I'll be waiting in my room in one hour.
Come claim your prize.
Poor chuck bass.
You made your bet.
now you have to lie in it.
Dan, is that you? Are you talkin' to me? you're the only person here.
Right, but that's, uh, never stopped you before.
I deserve that.
I haven't started yet.
Fine.
sit, pile it on.
my night couldn't get any worse.
Coming to rub my nose in it? falling for your line of bull Talk to vanessa already? Look, I know you have no reason to trust me.
And you ain't gonna be able to give me one, either, So you might as well go.
look, I don't care what you think about me.
But I'm not giving up.
I'm gonna save this place.
Try saving yourself first, kid.
I like to think I know people, but I was wrong about you.
So what are you doing at nate's anyway? Well, uh, nate and I are friends.
At least, I hope we are.
what about you? I just had to get out of my house, talk to someone.
Blair was busy.
chuck is chuck.
The only person I really wanted to talk to, I can't anymore.
So I came here.
Pretend I'm nate.
What? pretend m-- Well, look, he pretended to be me, so it's only fair.
Really? Well, um My mom hosted this big party.
It as supposed to be about our new family.
But it turns out, of course, it was for publicity.
So i-i blew up at her in front of everyone.
And this whole time, I was thinking that bart was the problem, But i-i realized it's all her.
You ever think that your mom acts like she's perfect Because she's She's too ashamed to acknowledge How far from it she's really been? I thought you were pretending to be nate.
Kidding.
I'm sorry.
You--do you not think I'm right? No, I'm--i mean, I'm sorry about everything.
I am, too.
They must have had me chipped while I was sleeping.
Hi, mr.
bass.
Hello, daniel.
eric said you might be here.
I'd like to take you home, serena.
I should probably go, Test out some of those theories of yours, See if they hold up.
I'm really glad you're nate's friend.
He really needs someone like you right now.
Hey.
where is everyone? Well The party wasn't the same after you left.
Actually, I think it might've even stopped While you were still here.
I owe you an apology.
No, I'm the one who said things they shouldn't have.
No, not about that, about the 17 years that I wasn't here.
And I did put the men in my life before you guys.
Well, it wasn't all bad.
There was a brief period between klauses.
Don't forget that, uh, weekend with sarkozy When he made us go to euro disney.
oh! I'm sorry I embarrassed you In front of a national magazine.
And I'm sorry I acted the way I did.
Apology accepted.
Well, our family is our family.
That's just who we are.
And I shouldn't care who knows about it, and I don't.
Just like the seasons, people have the ability to change.
It doesn't happen very often, But when it does, It's almost always right.
You killed the story, didn't you? I already put out the hit.
Sometimes it takes what's broken Becoming whole again.
What happened? sometimes it takes Opening up to new people and letting them in.
Hope you don't mind, but we've, uh, we've got a lodger.
So I'll make up the sofa? I'll get the ice cream.
And I'll get the guitar And the "songs of the '80s" fakebook.
I'm thinking wham! Uh, almost forgot-- make yourself at home.
But most times, it takes just one person Who is truly afraid to show what they feel Getting an opportunity they never thought possible.
What took you so long? If you thought that was long, You have no idea what you're in for.
Say it.
Say what? I'll say anything.
Say those three words you wanted me to say.
"are you kidding?" Not quite.
Eight letters.
three syllables.
Say them, and I'm yours.
But I'm already yours, And you're ruining the mood with all this talk.
you can't say it.
You wanted it from me.
I'm prepared to settle.
Maybe I'm not.
Chuck bass, I Will never say those words to you.
Then you will never have me.
Is this because of vanessa? it was a game, chuck.
That's it.
Maybe I want to raise the stakes.
Are you ready to play that game? I chased you for long enough.
Now it's time you chased me.
And some things never change.
Let a new game begin.
X.
o.
x.
o.
, gossip girl.
Gossip girl here, Your one and only source Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
Say those three words, and I'm yours.
I will never say those words to you.
We were just playing chess, and she was another piece That you needed to knock over on your way to take the queen.
I'm really glad you're nate's friend.
He really needs someone like you right now.
Hope you don't mind, but we've got a lodger.
That's not my dress! it's my dress.
You can't make me give up my job with eleanor.
watch me.
Your dad asked me to bring over all my stuff on homeschooling.
Every girl fantasizes about finding her prince charming.
But if that prince refuses to come You are late.
time for breakfast.
I'll be down in a minute.
I just have to finish something.
A girl has to take matters into her own hands.
Don't forget--god always watching, miss blair.
Wait, no.
What do you mean the herringbone won't arrive until tomorrow? The meeting with the buyers from bloomingdale's is today.
No, I don't care about italian customs.
if the electricity goes out, I think we found a new energy source.
she's making me dizzy.
Fine, then you can be the one to tell eleanor that yourself.
Stupid! stupid italians.
Oh, oh, I know, with their pizza and pasta and michelangelo.
But apparently not their herringbone.
dad, you don't understand.
Eleanor put me in charge, and it's a really big deal.
honey, breathe.
No, no time for oxygen.
I am late.
Oh, and I forgot my homework.
Seriously, she's making me feel like a slacker.
Maybe I can help you fix that.
Tomorrow night's the aaron rose opening at the gallery.
Vanessa and I could really use your help setting things up.
Aaron rose is that artist You--you discovered up at r.
i.
s.
d.
, right? yeah, the kid's amazing.
Homework, headset, handbag, check, check, check.
I have to pee.
guys, have you seen my sketchbook? Oh, no, no, nate! whoa, sorry! oh, my gosh.
Jenny-- sorry, uh You--did you do something with your hair? Uh, yeah.
shorter, blonder.
I was--i was bored.
I like it.
it looks-- it looks good.
Oh, go ahead and use the bathroom.
I'm sorry.
oh, no.
I didn't mean to-- no, no, no.
I'm gonna go.
it's fine.
I'll just No, no, no, no.
no, no, no, it's fine.
bye.
Okay.
Want to get in? I'd love to give you a ride.
Oh, I'm sure you would.
Too bad you've made the terms of that arrangement impossible.
About that--maybe I was a little too hasty.
Come on.
get in.
Maybe I don't want you anymore.
Don't torture me.
I'm dying.
All you have to do is say those three magic words.
I hate you.
Eleanor waldorf.
Dude, I love that dress.
Thanks.
I mean, thanks on behalf of eleanor waldorf designs.
I'm agnes, by the way.
I think we've worked together, 'cause I kind of recognize the top of your head.
jenny, and yeah, 'cause I think I recognize your feet.
Um, excuse me a minute.
okay.
Eleanor, I think the buyer from bloomingdale's is here.
Should--should I take notes, or what do you Uh, you said I could be in the meeting today, remember? Well, not today.
I need you to finish that.
Robert? Darling.
I am so glad they sent you.
come.
you are going to love it.
Jenny? Nate? what are you doing here? I found this when you left, and I thought You might need it, so oh, my gosh, I do.
thank you.
thank you so much.
Sure.
that was really nice of you.
Well, I'll let you-- let you get back to work.
yeah, I'll see you later.
Bye.
bye.
That guy is totally into you.
Uh, no, he's not.
he thinks of me like a little sister.
Yeah, a little sister he'd like to do.
No.
no, he doesn't.
yeah, yes, yes.
How's the--how's a.
p.
economics treating you? Um, well, today there was a rousing debate About inflation versus liquidity, Which isabelle settled by calling warren buffett.
Apparently, he's her godfather.
Hey, um, so the other night, Seeing you was really nice.
I know the first leg Of the dan/serena "let's be friends" tour Was a disaster, but, uh well, we were young and stupid then.
Now we're older and wiser.
You have to help me destroy chuck bass.
ooh.
All right, I'll take that as my cue to leave.
oh, you're very perceptive.
Dan, wait.
if you're having a problem with chuck, Then a man's perspective could be helpful.
Just because you two are making a doomed attempt At being friends doesn't mean I have to play the enabler.
blair, come on.
Well, if you're plotting against chuck bass, Then i--i'm sure I can think of something.
Fine.
I have an itch that only chuck can scratch, And he won't oblige unless I tell him I love him.
ugh.
You--you need help getting chuck to sleep with you? really? You hear the judgment in his voice right now, right? He--he's working on that.
Yeah.
you're right.
I'm sorry.
uh, no--no judgment, only help.
So do you love him? no! no, of course not.
Then why don't you just say it to get what you want? Frat guys have been doing that since forever.
I can't.
If I say it, then chuck wins.
Right, but if you say it, then you get him, and you win.
No, I lose.
see? this is totally pointless.
I was thinking I would just disappear for a while And give him a taste of life without me.
no, no, no.
That's a terrible idea.
Don't disappear.
become unavoidable.
Chuck may be a deviant, but he's still a man.
So just, you know, drive him crazy, Wear him down.
you should be good at that.
Look who finally got a little interesting.
I'm sure it's a fluke.
See? isn't this nice? Ugh.
even broken up, you guys make me nauseous.
Jenny! I am so sorry about today with robert.
I know you wanted to be at that meeting.
It's okay.
I've just been so on edge, Because these meetings with these buyers Have not been going the way that I had expected.
I don't understand.
The--the runway show went so well.
That's this season.
they want to know about next season.
Fortunately, robert did see one dress that he was very fond of.
I didn't know you started anything for next season.
I haven't.
he--he loved the dress that you are wearing.
Barneys and bendel's are coming tomorrow.
I have to have something to show them.
Um, you could show them this dress.
Well, if you're offering.
I do think that it would be good for both of us.
Right, 'cause then I could be in those meetings? Absolutely.
when those buyers leave here, They will know the name jenny humphrey.
So you are going to have to remake that dress In my fabrics, of course.
Um, um, eleanor, the meeting's tomorrow.
I-i don't even have a pattern for this dress.
I'd have to take the whole thing apart And completely make a new one.
You expect me to reschedule barneys and bendel's? Okay.
I guess i better get to it.
Yeah.
Want to get a drink? Want to say those three little words? No.
Then no drink.
Why? scared you won't be able to handle it? Spotted-- upper east side beauty Laying down the gauntlet for her favorite beast.
But careful, princess.
it's gonna take more Than a little leg to get this prince to ravish you.
I'll have one drink with you, Unless you can convince me why I should stay, of course.
Well, just because we've reached an impasse On a certain issue doesn't mean we can't be friends.
So ever since charlize theron became the face of dior, I've wanted to change my signature scent.
I've been trying out a new one.
I can't decide if I like it.
Would you mind? It smells a little like desperation.
Yeah, well, I'll just keep on looking.
thank you.
You've been very helpful.
To friendship.
Oops! I am so sorry.
Let me help you with that.
I gave you a shot.
And while your efforts were admirable, I'm bored, and you ruined my pants.
Good night, blair.
Hi.
um, I'm looking for dan humphrey.
Uh, yeah, he's here with vanessa somewhere.
Cafe? maybe? Uh, wait.
What do you think? if no one comes to the show, You might be the only one who ever reads it.
Um, well, I don't know much about art.
But I do know a lot about spelling, so Oh, no.
I think maybe you--you should have had someone proofread it Before you stuck it to the wall.
Are you kidding me? where did I mess up? -I-i went over it a hundred times! -I'm kidding.
Wow.
you haven't even said your name.
-You're already humiliating-sorry about that.
Good, so you'll stop abusing me then? No, but I will introduce myself.
I am serena.
Uh, aaron.
Oh! aaron.
then--then-- then you're the artist.
Yeah.
I have to meet rufus at the storage space.
He is stressing.
if his right eye starts to twitch, -That's when you have to break out the valium.
-too late.
He's been winking nonstop since lunch.
The caterer thought he was hitting on him.
-Hey, could you, uh, get that for me? -it's, uh, blair.
Since when does she call you? Oh, uh I'm--i'm helping her with this thing.
-Um, I gotta take this.
sorry.
-All right.
Hello? I just wanted to thank you For encouraging me to throw myself at chuck.
I can skip dinner now that I'm so full on humiliation.
-Chuck was completely unmoved.
-well, are you--are you sure He wasn't just acting like it didn't work? Unfortunately, there was no hard evidence of that, Literally.
I didn't even get the chance to show him my necklace Tangled up in my hair.
The nape of the neck is chuck's kryptonite.
oh, that's good to know.
-So he just got up abruptly,and he,he left? -like a bass outta hell.
Well, then you got him right where you want him.
trust me.
He's headed home.
intercept him.
I'll let you know what happens.
Oh, please don't.
So I don't get it.
where--where's the mike? Oh, they're hidden.
there's a bunch all around the gallery.
Well, I hope people only have nice things to say About you and your show, because you're gonna hear 'em.
Well, I guess you'll have to come and find out.
Serena? -Hey.
you been here long? -no, uh, not that long.
Okay, well, you hungry? 'cause we should get going.
See you later, aaron.
yeah, you, uh, you two have fun on your date.
Oh, no, it's-- it's not a date.
yeah, no, we're, uh, we're just fr-- We--we used to date, but we're friends now.
I should get back.
dude, eleanor is a slave driver.
But don't worry.
I'll get you home in time -I'll get u home To get all your work done.
-ladies.
By the way, I love your dress.
I mean, I've been coveting it all day.
Who makes it? I mean, it's definitely not eleanor waldorf.
.
not yet Um, no, I made it, actually.
No way.
okay, no, now I am wearing it.
come on.
What am I gonna wear? Uh, jenny, this is max.
max, jenny.
Hi.
hey, what's happening? I cannot believe you told blair to go to my house to seduce chuck.
well, I would have sent her to my place, but I thought It might be awkward a little bit with nate on the couch, so yeah.
How's that been with nate? Oh, it's been good, actually.
it's been really good.
I don't think I ever realized how much he-- Oh! is this the third time blair's texted me? Uh, fifth, actually, I think.
Oh, she wants to know if I have candles.
Ew.
no.
I'm--i'm sorry.
Um, go on.
no, I was just saying I don't think I ever realized how nate-- Is this driving you crazy, too? -No.
no, it's--it's fine.
-oh, she's getting cocky now.
What are you doing, blair? Serena knew how upset I was.
She didn't want me to be alone, So she invited me to sleep over.
Go away, chuck.
It's pointless.
I'm not gonna say it.
I don't care.
Ignore it.
Give it! You almost had me, blair.
Almost.
Hey, you bitch.
No, no, no.
you are a bitch.
You must've taken, like, a million pictures tonight.
It's what I do.
I like photographing you, though.
Okay, wait, wait.
that was trish and saskia, And, uh, they just got off wor so they want to meet up now.
Uh, no, agnes, I gotta go.
I-i have so much work to do, it's not even funny.
No, sweetie, this is work.
I mean, trish and saskia are, like, the hottest stylists.
She's right.
you should meet these girls.
They do editorial for "nylon" and "paper" all the time.
-I mean, it sounds awesome, but i -no, no, no.
listen, sweetie, Just come and say hi for, like, five minutes.
That's nothing.
you can sleep when you're dead, baby.
Which is gonna be tomorrow when eleanor kills me.
I'm sorry.
i-i am gonna have to pull an all-nighter as it is.
-I have--i have to go.
-all right, suit yourself.
Agnes! Agnes, you have my dress! Excuse me.
I need--excuse me.
Excuse me.
agnes! This is agnes.
you know what to do, bitches.
Sorry, j.
, but in the real world, You can't take a note to the principal When a drunken model eats your homework.
Agnes, I'm gonna kill you.
No, dude, no, no, no, trust me.
i-i'm sorry.
I just got all of your messages.
Look, here, take the dress, and I don't think that You should give this to eleanor, by the way.
-I mean, my friends,they freaked over it last night.
-great.
I don't care.
Okay, seriously, you work your ass off, and for what? So eleanor can rip off your ideas? No, eleanor promised that I could be in the meetings With the buyers from bendel's and barneys today.
Just like she introduced you to the guy from bloomingdale's.
Look, come here, okay? no.
stop.
Jenny, come here.
agnes! oh, my god, I don't have time for this.
what? Just look at this, okay? I mean seriously, this can be an ad campaign.
Yeah, that does look pretty cool.
I mean, right? and look, you can do whatever you want to do, But, I mean, what do you think people will say when they see That jenny humphrey's finally gone on her own? I don't know.
"jenny humphrey's so young to have her own line"? Or "too bad jenny humphrey's stuff Looks exactly like eleanor waldorf's.
" Blair waldorf in brooklyn.
-You two,are you two lost? -will you talk to her, please? I--there's nothing to talk about.
I told you it's over.
She stopped listening to me.
maybe she'll listen to you.
Um, sure.
I'm gonna go check out the art in the art gallery.
Talk.
Oh, she's back.
Wow, this is looking complicated.
Don't worry.
You walk in on surgery halfway through, it looks like murder.
-Can I help? -you know how to weld? Um, I've seen "flashdance" several times.
You and chuck have been toying with each other forever.
So you didn't win this one.
you ever think maybe you -Should just, I don't know, let it go? -this is different.
Why? Do you--do you love him? Wow.
someone loves chuck bass.
I don't know.
I just I I don't understand how it got to this place.
You know, the first time that I told serena I loved her, Uh, it was terrifying.
I've never felt so exposed.
But the feeling that I got when she said it back to me Uh, was probably the single greatest moment of my life.
But you broke up.
Doesn't mean I wouldn't do it all over again.
If I say it, he wins, and if he wins, Then I'll just be another girl to him.
You don't know that that's true.
You have to decide what's most important to you-- Keeping your pride and getting nothing or taking a risk And--and maybe, maybe, having everything.
Well, I almost lost a finger in the process, I might be permanently cross-eyed, but I did it.
Thank you.
you look like hell.
You should go home.
Uh, the buyers are gonna be here any minute.
Yeah, I know.
that's why I'm gonna need every moment alone To figure out what the hell am I gonna do? this dress is a mess! It's not my finest work, but I wouldn't call it a mess.
The seams aren't finished, the zipper gapes, And--and you finished the hem on the machine.
I told you that once the machine ate my fabric, -I had to start all over.
-Stop lying to me.
I know where you were last night.
Laurel caught the interns looking at pictures Of you and agnes out at some trashy bar.
Look, I'm sorry.
I thought I could still get it done in time.
You want to be a grown-up and have a real job? You have to accept real responsibility And the consequences for your actions When you don't come through.
I should've known better than to give so much responsibility To a child.
A-a child? I'm sorry, but this child seems to be the only one That can design anything that the buyers are remotely interested in.
This is not about that dress.
you are using that dress As an excuse because you are scared That if I am in that meeting and meet someone important That they will want to be in business with me and not you.
You are lucky I don't fire you this minute.
Oh, you are lucky that I don't just quit, Because then what would you do? Go on home.
I'll see you monday.
Can I at least have my dress back? Sure.
it's of no use to me anyway.
here.
I don't mean this one.
You touch this dress, you will never set foot in here again.
Sometimes the most important thing to know Is when to get out And when to give in.
So i-i'd say this was a success.
Makes me realize what a bust all my other openings were.
Well, I'm gonna let you bask in your glory, Because serena's here, and And she brought blair again.
That's the second time that girl was here today.
You're not I'm not what? oh, no.
oh, no, no, no, no.
no, no.
I'm not--no.
I mean, serena wants us to get along, But not like that.
no, that would, uh, that would be sick.
Why don't we just tell serena you're not interested In being friends with blair? oh, we just started hanging out again.
I don't want to rock the boat.
hey.
This is a huge turnout.
Aaron must be so thrilled.
And your dad.
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty exciting.
Uh, so I thought you were gonna be with chuck tonight.
-What happened? -oh, she is, um, but she told him to meet her here.
She needed some moral support.
Yes.
she is freaking out.
she needs a drink.
Let me see what I can do about that for her.
So first nate's a part of the family, And then I see you've invited blair to my opening? seriously? I'm sorry.
i-i know.
I know.
I didn't invite her, But serena and blair tend to be a package deal.
And I don't know.
I've--i've recently Sort of seen another side to her, and I mean, she's not that bad.
Are you kidding? you're talking about blair waldorf.
She and chuck just used me as catnip For one of their twisted little games, -And what they did was really messed up.
-i-i had no idea.
Why didn't you tell me that? Truthfully, i-i was embarrassed.
And the weird part is That chuck wound up being the more human of the two.
At least he felt a little bad about it.
not her.
-What? -no, it's just--i can't believe that I allowed myself To be sucked in by blair waldorf.
What do you think? Um, I think that you are officially a successful artist.
Well, thank you.
you know what they say-- "success is nothing without someone to share it with.
" They do say that.
So who are you planning to share it with? Uh, my dad, My nana, my dog mookie, named by nana.
She's a huge mets fan.
And, uh, and you.
Uh, uh, you.
I was hoping you.
Maybe dinner? Uh, sorry.
i, um, I'm not really dating right now.
The vague and unsatisfying "i'm not dating right now" response.
I know it well.
-Usually I'm giving it, not getting it.
-sorry.
Yeah, I can tell, Which is why I'm gonna give you a second chance.
If you can tell me the fate of cecil the caterpillar, I will go out with you.
Okay, I don't really date crazy people who speak in riddles.
Just think about it, And when you figure it out, I'm yours.
Chuck just texted me.
he wants to meet me on the roof.
The roof? well, this way, if he doesn't say it back, Then I can just jump.
then he'll be really sorry.
Oh, no.
don't do it, b.
You don't want your obit to say you died in brooklyn.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Hey.
stay there.
Blair, I need to talk to you.
-I can't.
chuck's waiting for me.
-I know.
it's about that.
Just, um, you know, be--be careful.
Well, why? you said to be the opposite of careful.
-You told me to take a risk.
-Right.
I know.
I know.
But i--it--it was bad advice, 'cause when I said that, I was thinking of how things were for--for serena and me.
I mean, we're talking about chuck here.
-It's not the same thing.
yes, it is, and it's gonna be okay.
Sure, well, maybe.
just before you say anything, Make sure he's done playing games.
He is.
now if you'll excuse me Hey.
I didn't know you guys were coming.
-Hey.
I'm gonna go say hey to aaron, okay? -okay.
Yeah, max knows aaron from r.
i.
s.
d.
, So he wanted to come and say hi and I wanted to see you After hearing about your crazy stunt with eleanor.
Yeah.
I'm actually just about To go tell my dad about that one.
Before you do, guess what? The editor from "nylon" saw the photos from last night.
He wants to do a feature on you as a designer to watch.
Agnes, since I quit eleanor's, I am an unemployed, homeschooled 15-year-old.
I'm not even an intern to watch.
dude, relax.
Max and I were just talking about it.
You should do your own clothing line.
Yeah, sure.
with no money, no contacts, nobody knows who I am.
That sounds like a fast track to success.
Stop coming up with reasons not to do it And just make some more dresses.
I can model them.
max will do some photos.
I mean, you can totally do this.
you really think so? Yes.
now you're gonna come with me to this party, And you're gonna meet this editor, 'cause he's dying to meet you.
So are you my bitch or what? I am.
I am totally your bitch.
good.
Jenny, hey.
hey, wait up.
Hey, are you taking off already? Uh, yeah.
me and my friends are going to a party.
oh, I didn't know.
I-i was hoping we could hang out tonight, but Well, there's always tomorrow at the loft.
Really? I mean, I kind of doubt that.
You're always working now, like last night, And the night before, and the, you know Yeah, well, I actually quit eleanor's.
Wait.
you quit eleanor's? That job was-- was everything to you.
I know.
um, it might sound crazy, But I'm actually thinking of starting my own line.
Really? what does your dad think about that? Okay.
um, I was hoping for a-- More of like a, "congratulations, jenny" Or at least a monosyllabic "wow," but No, look.
I mean, come on, jenny.
You really think you can start your own business right now? You coming, jen? Uh, yeah.
be right there.

d.
with aaron, And he's an amazing photographer.
He's gonna shoot my line.

Um, my friends are waiting for me, So I guess if my dad asks, just tell him I'm at eleanor's.
wait.
Brooklyn? At least it will be memorable.
I'm sorry, but don't you have something you want to say to me? Yes.
This is so silly.
what does it matter who says it first? Why don't we just say it together? Because that wasn't the deal.
Why does everything have to be a deal? Because we made it one.
What's going on, blair? You told me you had something to say to me.
Say it.
Why do I have to be the one to go first? I was the one who waited on that helipad for you.
I went to tuscany alone.
it's ancient history.
I was the one who asked you to say it first.
at the white party? When you were on your way out with the count? Did you really think I was going to say it then? Yes, and when you didn't, I wanted to die.
Don't tell me you brought me all the way to brooklyn for this I thought you were ready to tell me how you really felt.
Obviously it was just another one of your games.
My games? you're the one who started this.
And you're the one who finished it.
E me.
I don't think we've met yet.
Nate.
aaron.
Nice to meet you.
yeah, a pleasure.
That guy max that was here earlier? Is he a friend of yours? yeah, yeah, I know him from school.

look, look, blair and chuck Were gonna self-destruct at some point, So I just-- I may have helped it along.
Wait.
you intentionally sabotaged blair? I know you're upset, And that--that was not my intention, But I just found out they completely screwed over vanessa.
no.
Whatever they did to vanessa, that's different.
This is about two people who love each other.
blair and chuck? c-come on.
I don't understand.
I thought you wanted to help blair.
No, I did this for you, 'cause you wanted me to help her.
I don't care about blair waldorf.
All of this is a-- it's--it's all a game to her.
No, in this case, it's not.
Blair loves chuck.
she's just been too scared to admit it.
I told her to talk to you Because I genuinely thought that you would help her be brave.
These are amazing.
Thank you.
Good thing you like 'em, 'cause soon it'll be shots Of you and your clothes up there.
Um if you guys want to be alone, That's cool.
I can just call later.

I was just choosing to ignore you.
Well, don't, Because what just happened with you And blair-- it's none of your business.
No, it is, actually.
Look, I don't know how you feel about her, But I do know how she feels about you, And she was going to tell you until I stopped her.
Oh, my god, agnes.
Oh, come on.

Then I can wait.
Fine.
-sorry -come on Serena, hey.
serena, hey.
look, I'm--i'm--i'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.
I was out of line.
yeah, you were.
Look, I'm sorry that blair and chuck messed with vanessa.
She doesn't deserve that, but instead of hurting blair, You should have been honest with me.
i-i know.
it's just-- Look, it's about what happened last time with amanda.
I was worried what would happen if we fought, 'cause i-i really want this to work with us.
yeah, me, too, But it's not going to if we can't talk to each other yeah.
you're right.
Okay, so--so let's--let's talk.
let's be friends.
let's There was something I wanted to tell you.
Um aaron asked me out.
But I said no, because i-i wasn't sure how you would feel.
But I kinda want to say yes.
Wow.
look at that, Just diving into the deep end of honesty.
Headfirst.
Look, I like aaron.
He's a good guy, so, uh, you have my blessing, If that's what you're looking for.
Well, he--he does seem nice, And even though we just met, I feel like I've--i've known him my Oh, my god.
What? "cecil the caterpillar.
" camp suisse.
Uh, did you just-- are you having a seizure, 'cause you're speaking in tongues.
no, I'm sorry.
I just--i just realized that i-i do know aaron.
We went to summer camp together, And there was this song about cecil the caterpillar.
I-i can't believe I didn't recognize him.
Oh, wow.
you--you went to--you went to camp in europe together.
Uh, that's cute.
No, it was--it was much more than just camp.
we got married.
Uh, there was a small ceremony with licorice rings On the banks of lake geneva.
it was tasteful.
mm.
what happened? Well, I took a bite out of my ring, so he asked for a divorce.
But we were happy for a time.
I can't believe-- I have to go find him.
D-do you mind? Oh.
no, of course not.
no.
I, uh, I have to find vanessa anyway.
Look, he's the-- he's the ex-husband.
I'm just the ex-boyfriend.
The problem with fairy tales is That they set a girl up for disappointment.
In real life, The prince goes off with the wrong princess Or the spell wears off And two lovers realize they are better off as Well, whatever they are.
Are you here to gloat? over what? Well, you won.
pop the champagne.
I didn't win.
Then why does it feel like I lost? The reason we can't say those three words to each other Isn't because they aren't true.
Then why? I think we both know That the moment we do, It won't be the start of something.
it'll be the end.
Think about it.
Chuck and blair going to the movies.
Chuck and blair holding hands.
We don't have to do those things.
We can do the things that we like.
What we like is this The game.
Without it, I'm not sure how long we'd last.
It'd just be a matter of time before we messed it all up.
Look, I'd rather wait.
Maybe in the future I suppose there could be some excruciating pleasure in that.
How could you do that to me? what are you talking about? You're lucky I showed up when I did.
what? That was a bad scene, jenny.
no, it wasn't, okay? We were dancing around in our underwear, not making a porno.
Not yet, anyway.
No, not ever! I would never let myself Get in a situation like that.
All right? I know what I'm doing, nate.
no, I know you think you do, But that guy was taking advantage of you.
Okay, you are not my father and you are not my brother, So why do you care so much? Because But I'll confess.
Every once in a while, a girl craves her fairy-tale ending.
So sleep tight, kiddies.
It seems like little j.
got her happily ever after.
Gossip girl here-- Your one and only source into the scandalous lives Of manhattan's elite.
You confided in Dan and even Blair.
Everyone but me.
So that's it? We can't even be friends? Well, we were never really friends, remember? Hope you don't mind, but we've,we've got a lodger.
Make yourself at home.
Have you seen my sketchbook? Whoa, sorry! Oh, my god.
Yale is your dream, And you deserve to go here more than I do.
You can't share this.
We'll find a way.
I'm gonna give you a second chance.
If you can tell me the fate of cecil the caterpillar, I will go out with you.
I just realized that i-i do know Aaron.
We went to summer camp together.
We got married.
There was a small ceremony with licorice Rings.
You should do your own clothing line I can model them.
Max will do some photos.
That guy was taking adVantage of you.
You are not my father, and you are not my brother So why do you care so much? Can I at least have my dress back? You touch this dress, you will never set foot in here again Spotted at minh--jenny humphrey buying 16 yards of tulle.
But since when does Eleanor Waldorf Pay for her purchases with a penny jar? They say a stitch in time saves nine.
Will it save little j.
? We are going to blow them away.
We better, otherwise I am so dead.
Dude, have you seen the time? At least your brother and the lodger Went to go see a movie.
Yeah, that's Nate avoiding me once again.
He's still acting like He didn't stick his tongue down your throat? Yeah.
Ew.
Well, amnesia doesn't really happen till after s*x with guys, So what's his problem? I don't know.
He used to date Vanessa? I'm Dan's little sister? Too young? I wouldn't know.
We don't talk.
So what? After tonight you'll be so famous, You'll have ten Nate archibalds.
Yeah, except I only want the one.
Okay, fine, then you have to make the move.
That's the only way it's gonna work.
Oh, my god.
Is that the time? I told you.
Okay, yeah.
You need to sew way faster, 'cause we are so screwed.
'cause ready or not, We're putting on a fashion show.
I just--i think they're up to something, man With their closed doors and this private thing for Eleanor.
Jenny--she didn't say anything to you? Uh, no, no.
But we haven't talked much this week, so She seemed weirdly happy that we were leaving the house Like how much privacy does she really need To watch "project runway" and eat pizza? Oh, oh.
Hold on a second.
Ooh, it's Jordan.
Who? The, uh, you know, the t.
A.
From yale.
She was trying to get me a recommendation? You--you hooked up with her.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Jordan.
Oh, it's good to be Nate.
"i had three professors read your stories.
I'll call you later.
" hey, that sounds like good news.
Good? No.
It means she had the first one read it.
He didn't like it.
Neither did the second, And after the third, she probably just gave up.
And why text before calling if you don't need To soften the blow? Or she was somewhere she couldn't talk, So she sent a text.
With an imagination like that, you should be a writer.
Hey, where are you going? I-i can't concentrate on a movie right now.
I-i-i gotta--i gotta go home and stare at my phone.
Maybe you could talk to jenny, figure out what's going on.
Yeah, sounds like a great idea.
My father went to yale, And I've wanted to go there ever since I was a little girl.
How nice.
So, Serena, tell me about karl Lagerfeld's birthday party.
Oh, it--it was fun But did you know Blair's mother is a designer? You know, when dean Berube suggested I meet with you, I had no idea you would be such a delight.
Yes, thank you.
Bye.
Oh, excuse me.
My husband's on his way out.
Malchus, this is Serena Van der Woodsen.
Good afternoon.
Uh, hi, and best friend Blair Waldorf.
Pleased to meet you.
What am I doing here? Liz and her husband are both prominent yale donors And good friends with the dean.
Well, Just like their good friend the dean They only have eyes for you.
Come on, B.
, you can do this.
Yale is your dream Just stop cracking your knuckles.
Well, as pleasant as this has been, I'm afraid I'm going to have to run.
My husband's off to his business dinner, And before I meet my friends from bryn mawr, I have to order room service for my daughter.
Oh, no.
She's gonna be here by herself all night Oh, Emma doesn't mind.
As long as she has her harry potter book And a bowl of ice cream, she's happy as a clam.
Uh, no, Blair will take her to a movie.
I-i would take her myself, But I've got something with my family, so Why, Emma would love that.
You sure you don't mind? Emma, dear? Come here.
Anything for the friends of dean Berube.
Yes, mother? Serena's friend Blair.
Yes, would like to take you to a movie.
Oh, thank you.
This is gonna be fun.
Hello.
Hey.

So did you figure out Cecil the caterpillar.
Camp Suisse.
We got married and exchanged licorice rings.
And you ate your five minutes after the ceremony.
Yeah.
When did you finally remember? Um, About the time you were speeding away with a gir On the back of your motorcycle.
Audra.
Yeah, she's just a friend.
No, I recognized you the moment you walked In the gallery.
No, you didn't, but it's okay Some faces you don't forget.
Um You know, I have this charity gala.
It's actually here, and I wouldn't normally go, But my mom's being honored and my brother's out of town, And I'm rambling, but I was wondering I'm late! I know.
I was thinking maybe we could, uh Mm.
I'm sorry.
Hey, uh, maybe in another nine years.
What was that about? Jenny, come on.
The Van is almost here.
Eleanor's going to kill herself after tonight.
I know.
I just have a few more things to do.
Dan? What are you doing here? I spy with my little eye someone getting busted.
Is my mom gone? Yes.
So what kind of movies do you like? Something where the animals sing or Oh, sweet heaven.
So muffy mcdonough's been bragging About how she's gonna lose her virginity 'cause she finally landed a date with the lacrosse captain.
They call him "the de-virginator.
" Oh, my god.
Stop your mouth from moving.
But now that I finally have the night away from mom and dad, We'll see who's first.
I'm saying t.
T.
F.
N.
To my you know what.
Ormaybe we'll see how your mom feel About your little clearance sale, lohan.
Please.
I heard you talking about getting into yale.
Well, dean Berube is, like, my uncle, So help me or I tell him how you took me to a club And got me wasted.
Rumor has it that Lady b.
's been outfoxed by a young fox Got a credit card, fake i.
D.
, and I want bacardi and a boy.
This body's open for business.
It seems only one ivory tower has been stormed tonight.
You quit Eleanor's? I had to.
She was using me.
Does dad know about it? No, of course dad doesn't know.
What am I saying? You haven't been shipped off To a convent yet.
Hey, Dan, just take it easy.
Nate, look, I'm sorry, but this is none of your Business.
Dan, I promise I'll tell dad everything tomorrow I just--i really need tonight.
I've worked so hard.
For--for what? What is this Stop! We're putting on a guerilla Fashion show.
I don't know what that means Okay.
These dresses--i made them.
And--and Agnes and her friends are gonna model.
Please, Dan.
Tonight's the one chance I have to show everyone what I can do.
IVan, I swear if that Van's not here in ten minutes, You're not getting those photos of me.
Are we busted now or what? Dan, please.
I just need a few hours.
Then I'll tell dad everything.
All right.
I, uh, i-i just need to think.
Well, you finally did it-- Made absolutely sure I'm never gonna Get into yale.
What are you talking about Little Emma--turns out she's less holly hobbie And more jenna jameson.
Can you speak plainly? She's determined to become a woman on my watch, And if I don't help pimp her out, she's gonna Character-assassiNate me to the dean.
I don't understand.
I thought she liked ice cream and magic Next time leave the scheming to the experts.
What are those? Pictures from camp Suisse Aaron dressed up as cecil the caterpillar.
I bumped into him outside the palace.
The guy gave you a ring pop when you were Ancient, unimportant history.
Focus, Serena.
You got me into this, and I'm not losing yale Because of that little tart's libido.
Why don't you just occupy her for a while Take her to the charity gala.
When you get there, You can say you didn't know how lame it would be.
Then it's time for her to go home.
You're off the hook.
So I checked out "gossip girl," And I'm thinking we hit socialista Before beatrice.
See what I'm dealing with Emma, I was thinking, where is the glory In bedding down with some dirty manhattan hipster Who's probably filming you on the nanny cam? You really want to make muffy jealous? Have your flower plucked by one of the elite.
And where would I find someone like that? Luckily, we know the place.
But you're gonna have to pay a visit to my closet first.
Sorry.
Thing about a caf?- people weirdly want service.
Come on, v.
, what-- what am I gonna do? You gotta give me something here.
She's telling your dad tomorrow, And whatever this whole fashion show thing is, It sounds like she put a lot of work into it.
So we--we all just cover for her--you, me, Nate Don't lump me with Nate.
He's your friend.
Are--are we ever gonna talk about this? He was living there with no electricity, No furniture-- you did the right thing Which is why you haven't been to the loft since he moved in.
Just tell me.
Do you still have feelings for him? Nate hates me.
That's not what I asked.
Nate and I tried.
It didn't work.
End of story.
I'm just saying, if you like him, You should tell him, 'cause Nate is a good guy.
It's funny how you're ready to condemn your sister, But Nate, who's done some pretty questionable things, Gets a free pass.
I get she lied-- no.
No.
It's not about the lying.
I-i don't want her to get in trouble.
What if she's about to make a huge, life-altering mistake, And I don't stop her? Who's about to make a huge mistake? Well, what do we have here? Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Chuck.
Bass.
Oh, my god.
I read about you on "gossip girl.
" You're-- you're like the devil.
Finally some truth in advertising.
Headed out, are we? Serena, Blair and I are going to the gala.
Hope you're coming? Well, I'm all for company on a saturday night, But the only thing I like that aged is my scotch.
What? It's old people? Blair told me it was all hot guys.
Sounds to me like you're being taken for a ride Well, how about you take me for a ride instead? Buckman, could you pass this to miss Serena? It was with the concierge.
Looks like you've just hooked yourself a Bass.
You look beautiful.
Can we go now? Patience, love.
The sooner we get there, the sooner the jig is up.
I'll go check on the vestal virgin.
Left at the concierge, miss.
Thank you.
Well-played, cecil.
She's gone! Who? Who do you think? Emma! Jenny, you should wait for Dan.
No, there's no time.
This is my one chance I have To prove that I can be a designer.
Otherwise it's back to being little j.
At constance, Except worse this time, because everyone's gonna know I failed.
And since when are you so worried? You haven't spoken two words to me all week.
Careful, guys! Those are couture! Hey, why do you keep eating those pot brownies? You know sugar makes you spaz.
Jenny, Come on.

A real limo.
This is so perfect.

Jailbait, that is.
Text him.
I've texted him six times.
Well, text him again before he screws that girl And any other chance that I had of getting Into yale! I put out an a.
P.
B.
On "gossip girl With Emma's facebook picture on it.
Every girl in manhattan will be on the lookout.
Chuck! You! What did you do with her? Hey! She assaulted me, demanded I deflower her.
Oh, limos and virgins, your specialty.
Just so you know, while there are few things I consider sacred, the back of the limo is one of them.
When she realized she couldn't ride this thoroughbred, She bolted.
Last time I saw her, she was heading in a cab downtown.
Hey, is just texted me-- she said the Bartender at 1oak Says e.
Boardman just used her credit Card there.
She didn't waste any time.
Come on I can't go.

Here.
I pulled you a suit on the way out.
It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
I don't see her.
I'll talk to the Bartender.
You have to admit, the licorice ring was sweet.
Look, even if you're just being literal, I don't want to hear another word about your albatross Until we find mine.
There she is.
Oh, my god.
Look.
Looks like you got nailed, just not in the way you wanted.
Give me time.

Their cab is probably halfway to serge's by now, If she even waits that long.
She's not answering her phone.
Well, congratulations, s.

She already left.
The Bartender says she's in the corner booth.
E.
Boardman? ELizabeth.
That's not Emma.
That's her mother, And that's not her father.
Oh, my god.
It seems the saying's true-- Like mother, like daughter.
Or is it the other way around? Oh, she's cool.
Don't worry.
This is stewart.
He's in love with me.
Uh, isn't he gonna get fired for this? Yeah, well, he was gonna quit anyway To be a professional gamer.
Oh, I have to check on the models.
Stewart, take this.
Do not do anything gross to my friend.
If you'd just come to me sooner-- Never mind we don't know where she is.
We don't even know what she's doing.
I know, dad.
I'm sorry.
I-i just-- She's still not picking up.
Did you try Nate? I did already.
His phone's off.
Oh, I should've known better.
I should never have trusted her What? Spotted at the palace-- Nate archibald and little j.
What is it? Um, "gossip girl.
" they're at the palace.
Let me see.
There's nothing to see.
Let's just go.
Let's get out of here now.
We hear lonely boy's b.
F.
F.
Still carries a torch for Nate.
If she finds out about little sister, Wonder who'll get burnt.
Come--come on.
You're a cab.
Do that weaving thing.
Dad, dad, dad.
It's okay.
We're gonna find her, all right? At least she's with Nate.
He'll watch out for Her.
He couldn't have known about this, right I gotta think Nate would've said something.
Don't be so sure.
Nate didn't know.
He would never keep that from us.
We don't know what Nate would do, Vanessa.
His morals are questionable at best.
Who--who would've thought that he'd date both you And a certain lady? And by "lady," I mean older, and by "date," I mean-- What's he talking about? Nothing.
What is up with you? What happened to, "if you like him, tell him.
Nate's a good guy"? Are you saying--you're saying you do like Him? Are you saying that he's not a good guy Sounds like you still like him.
Is that jenny? No, it's--no, it's Jordan, The t.A.
From yale who will have to wait.
Come on.
You gotta be kidding me! You're letting the mister softee truck pass us? Come on.
Here.
Dad, that's a $1.
Whoa.
Are you sure jenny's here? Yeah.
What is this? A private party, sir.
If you're not on the list, I'm afraid I can't let you in.
I'm just here to find my daughter, so-- Rufus? What are you doing here? I-it's fine.
Okay.
I'm--i'm gonna go look for Nate.
He's taller and easier to spot.
I'm gonna look for jenny.
Thanks.
Uh But--well--is jenny okay? I saw her earlier.
What--what's going on? I was about to ask that myself.
Rufus.
Bart, hello.
I need to find my daughter, So if you see her, hold onto her, would you? Congratulations.
What? I didn't invite him.
Let's go get a drink.
Thank you, god, so much.
I won't let you down.
Chuck's seeing if the doorman knows Emma's guy.
Why? Who cares about him? Blair, no.
This poor little girl's mother is having an affair.
No wonder she's acting out.
So? This is my golden ticket.
You are not blackmailing that woman to get into yale.
Serena, open your eyes! This is a sign from god.
He wants me to do this.
This family needs help.
Well, no argument there.
They're even more screwed up than yours.
So humbert humbert's name is serge Grodanz.
His father plays tennis at the club.
I know where his building is.
Let's go.
I'm going over there.
You know, I'm--i'm late for the gala.
My mom's texting me.
Look, do whatever you want, Blair, But please save Emma first.
Fine.
We'll save Little red riding hood from the big bad wolf.
But after that, it's bulldog, bulldog, rah, rah, rah! I'm trusting you.
You have any bright ideas? As a matter of fact, one.
Dan.
Hey.
Whoa.
What are you doing? What am I doing? What are you doing? Or is this not you with my 15-year-old sister? Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, just calm down.
We took you into our house, Nate.
Look, Dan, it's not like I planned on it, all right Okay, things just happen.
I'm sorry.
Come on.
She's a sophomore.
I'm a senior.
Don't act like I'm some creepy older guy.
No, you're the guy who traded s*x for money.
Oh, my god.
Vanessa.
It's amazing I don't want you with my little sister.
Okay, look, I'm sorry I didn't say anything about jenny, okay? But you have no right to judge me.
Where is she? Look, I don't even know.
She went off to find Agnes.
Do you want me to come help you find her? No, I don't want your help.
I want you to pack up your stuff and get out of our house.
Emma, open up.
Emma? I know you're in there! Go away! Serge is in the bathroom, And when he gets out, There's gonna be one less virgin around Here.
I do have to admire her determination I'm not letting muffy lose hers before me.
She beats me in everything.
Tell her to check "gossip girl.
" Emma? Do you have your phone? Check "gossip girl.
" It's important.
Look, I already told you, nothing's gonna--what?! It says, "muffy's muff gets stuffed.
" does that mean-- That little muffy took her first steps as a woman? Afraid so.
She lost her virginity and her "gossip girl" cherry In the same night? But how did she get on "gossip girl"? It pays to have connections.
Emma? Come here, my little princess.
What? Who are you? Now I feel violated.
Come on.
Piece of advice-- lose the tulip.
Hey, it's Aaron.
Leave a message.
Oh, if this is Serena, that girl at the hotel today-- Not what you think.
I mean, not my girlfriend, If that's what you thought, 'cause I don't have a girlfriend, and I'm rambling.
So, uh, if this isn't Serena, leave a message.
Thank you.
Um, okay, that was the worst message I have ever heard Or the best.
Um, I was just calling to thank you for the ring, But somehow I am finding myself Wanting to give you another chance.
Hello? Hello? Are you calling for Aaron? Yeah.
Hi.
Who's this? Tamara.
Aaron's in the bathroom.
Do you wanna wait, or-- No! Uh, no, no.
Just-- just tell him, um No, just--don't-- don't tell him anything.
I'm sorry.
Cecil, you got me again.
Nate, where are you going? Jenny, I'm sorry.
I gotta go home.
Your brother's here, and he knows.
Wait.
What? Yeah, he saw us kissing on "gossip girl.
" He's here with your dad.
My--no, my dad's here? Jenny, come on.
The models are ready, and we gotta go.
No, no, no.
My dad and my brother are here.
Good.
So they can see how amazing you are with their own eyes Instead of reading it in the papers tomorrow.
I mean, it's not like he's going to kill you twice.
Okay.
Wait.
Please.
Nate, please, don't go.
I really need you here.
Please.
Good evening.
May I have your attention, please? Thank you.
As head of the new york philanthropic society, Presenting this award is my favorite duty.
Please join me in congratulating lily and Bart Bass.
Did you find her? No.
Lily and Bart Bass have funded the construction of clinics And hospitals in equatorial guinea, Sri lanka-- My apologies.
There seems to be Some sort of technical difficulty.
It looks great.
Thank you! Oh, my god.
Vanessa! Vanessa, wait! Here, here, here, jenny, jenny.
Stop.
No, just-- It's not your place, okay? No, I have to say something.
No, no.
Stop.
I shouldn't have done that.
I'sorry.
Jenny.
Vanessa! Looks like it's bros before hos for little j.
Who knew that when her loyalty kicked in, Nate would be kicked out? J humphrey designs! Backers are welcome--whoa.
Get your groping hands off of me, creep.
I cannot believe your sister.
She's taken it to a whole other level.
Yeah, yeah, she has.
She's gotta be around here somewhere.
I'll check the lobby.
You might be upset, but the truth is, This wasn't how you wanted to lose your virginity.
And which venue would you suggest, perhaps? Chuck, I know it wasn't easy Getting "gossip girl" to post that bogus report.
Thank you.
For you, anytime.
I think your little virgin's making a break for it.
Ugh! Emma.
Emma! Wait.
Aren't you done? You won-- You, muffy, my mom.
I'm the only loser.
You still don't get it.
Having s*x for the first time shouldn't be Part of a competition to beat muffy the lacross-titute.
It should be with someone you love.
Was your first time with someone you love? Yes.
It was.
And honestly There are better ways of getting your mother's attention.
I told you, this is about muffy.
Please.
I wrote the book on distracted, self-centered mothers.
My mom has never met a single one of my teachers.
She regularly forgets my birthday, And she only comments on my appearance When she has something to criticize.
But you're perfect.
True, and that's why I finally realized It wasn't about me The same way it's not about you.
My mom always says when we come to the city, We're gonna hang out and do mother-daughter things.
It never happens.
So tell her that.
And Can you try to avoid the serges of the world? Thanks, by the way.
That guy was pretty gross.
Uh Hello? Hey, Jordan.
Uh, no, no.
No, no, it's not too late.
Uh, yeah.
I-i saw that.
The three professors.
That's No, i-i know what anemic means.
Uh, all right, well, thank you.
Thank you for trying.
I appreciate it.
Okay.
Is everything okay? Um No.
No, not really.
No, don't-- don't worry about jenny.
She'll probably get in some trouble For disrupting the event, but honestly, I think everyone in there was kind of Relieved.
No, I know.
Jenny will be fine Jenny will be great, because jenny always does What she has to do to get what she wants.
I don't follow.
Tonight my sister alieNated everyone in her life.
But tomorrow she's gonna be in "the new york times.
" I just can't help but wonder If she's the one with all the guts in the family.
Hey, where is this coming from? Nowhere.
Nowhere.
I'm sorry.
The humphreys already spoiled your mom's night.
I don't wanna spoil yours, too.
No, I don't care about this night.
I care about you.
Tell me what's wrong.
Uh I'm not gonna get into yale Or probably any other school with a decent writing program.
No, Dan, that is not true.
No.
I gotta go find my dad.
Thank you.
Good night.
Do you realize what time it is? And look at that dress.
You expect me to believe you went to the movies in that? Mom, please don't.
This isn't her fault.
Bed now.
Bed! Mrs.
Boardman, before you say anything you'll regret-- What was your plan-- take my daughter clubbing And hope she'd plead your case to the dean? I have some bad news for you, miss Waldorf.
From what I've seen, you're not yale material.
Oh, you haven't seen anything yet.
Tell me, did you have a nice time With your bryn mawr friends? What is that supposed to mean? Here.
Let me lend you my phone.
You'll be needing it to make a call to New haven.
Mom, this isn't Blair's fault I told you to go to bed.
Blair was only trying to help me.
You're lecturing me? No wonder I don't want to spend time with you.
Bed! Right now! You were saying? Just Your daughter is a great girl.
You should pay more attention to her.
Soon it'll be too late.
Excuse me, ma'am? Um, did you see a girl come out? She had a blue shirt and dark, curly hair? Jenny.
Dad? Dad, let go of me.
Let go of me, dad.
I'm trying to find Vanessa.
I hope you're proud of yourself You know what? I am.
Because honestly, I achieved everything that I wanted.
Jenny, you can't just go through life Not caring about who you hurt.
Dad, I already have 32 missed calls on my phone, okay And those people aren't calling to tell me how mad they are That I ruined their party.
They're calling to tell me That they like my designs, and they want to Meet me.
Well, those people are not your father And speaking for him, I have never been more disappointed.
Hi.
Hi there.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Jenny, I think you owe lily an apology.
No, really.
No, no, no.
He's right.
Lily, I'm--i'm really sorry.
Well, honestly, it wasn't the evening I expected, But it was amazing.
The whole thing was inspired.
Okay, I'm just gonna wait over here for a moment.
If you think you're getting away with this tonight, You are dead wrong.
It's too late.
It's done.
Yeah, you're right.
Officer, if you're looking for the person responsible For tonight, this is her.
Dad! Rufus.
You can't be serious.
You're giving me no choice.
It's her number all over the polaroids.
Miss, I'm gonna have to take you to the station.
We'll call your parents from there.
He is my parent-- the one getting me arrested! Officer, my name is lily Bass, and I was the one Being honored this evening, and my husband Also owns this hotel, and we won't be pressing any charges.
Makes my job easier.
Lily, this is none of your business.
I am saving you from making a terrible mistake.
You know what? You guys figure it out.
I'm going home.
Poor jenny--all that glamour almost led to the slammer.
But what will the morning bring? Figured you'd be back at the family manor.
Is this the new minimalism? What the hell is going on? What do you think? I told you we were in trouble.
You didn't tell me it was this bad.
Then again, if it drove you to brooklyn, I guess I should have known.
Brooklyn's over.
I'm going to stay with my mom Don't be so dramatic.
You're coming with me.
No.
I'm not.
B.
, it's time to get up.
There are other schools besides yale--like princeton.
Princeton is a trade school.
There's only yale.
Well, I'm proud of you for not succumbing To your baser instincts.
Hey, even though you might not get into yale, At least this way you won't go to hell.
Blair Waldorf's phone.
Y-yes, dean Berube.
She--she's right here.
What? No! Yes.
Dean Berube.
What a surprise.
Miss Van der Woodsen? You have a visitor.
Yes.
So, uh, I was thinking you, me, assorted breakfast pastries.
How many pastries exactly? Is it just you and me, or is the entire harem Coming along? Yeah, I want to explain yesterday Look, Aaron, the rings were sweet, But I thought about it, And I don't really want to date someone who has a posse.
A posse? Well, in our last two encounters, You've been with two different girls.
Well, one--one was a friend.
So you've said.
And the other one was You know what? No, i-i could explain who Tamara is And why she was at my apartment last night.
The fact is, either you feel something here or you don't.
If you want an excuse not to give this a shot, that's fine.
But ever since you walked into the gallery last week, I haven't been able to stop thinking about you.
I even dug up my old camp stuff.
So did i.
Is it too weird to think that maybe fate brought us Back together again? Yes But romantic, too.
Hey, you know what? Forget breakfast.
I've waited nine years.
I think that merits dinner.
You didn't eat that ring, did you? No, not yet.
Good.
It's nine years old.
Wait.
You kept yours? I'll see you tonight.
Oh, my god.
Emma told the dean that I'm the one person Living or dead that she'd most like to have dinner with.
Oh, b.
! And he said that yale Could really use a girl like Blair Waldorf.
Oh, b.
, I'm so happy for you.
Hey, I was just about to we you.

  Your, uh, sister stomped out of here At about 6
0 this morning, so it's just the 2 of us.
Did you sleep in that last night? I didn't sleep, actually.
I was up all nigh Finishing this story for Noah Shapiro.
The guy from "the paris review"? Which story? The one about Chuck Bass.
You said you couldn't write that story.
No, I could always write it.
I chose not to.
Dan, just because jenny-- dad, look, The morning after my little sister stage A fashion show that all of new york city Will be talking about is not the time For the "slow and steady" speech.
All right, I'm sorry.
I-i tried it your way.
I wish I could get the two of you to understand That success, people praising you, it goes away.
And when that day comes, If you don't like who you are, you're done.
Well, I guess that's a chance I'm willing to take.
Dan, please.
I have to worry about you now? It's gonna be all I can do to try and reach jenny.
It's a little late for that, dad.
I-i think you need to look in her room.
S.
And b.
Are headed for yale.
Nate's headed out of town, and Dan's headed for trouble.
As for little sister jenny, She's nowhere to be seen.

Blair, ever since you walked into the gallery last week, i haven't been able to stop thinking about you.

The guy from "the paris review"? Which story? The one about chuck bass.
You said you couldn't write that story.
No, i could always write it.
I chose not to.
You should do your own clothing line.

Gossip Girl 210 French Gossip girl x.
o.
x.
o.
, gossip girl.
You're in for a real treat, son.
I even amazed myself with this bolognese.
I'm amazed at how calm you're acting.
Your 15-year-old daughter's moved in granted, agnes' mother's more courtney love than june cleaver, but she's a committed parent, and she's gone through similar phases with agnes.
She promises to call every day, so jenny's safe.
You're gonna act like you're cool with it so she chooses to come home instead of being forced.
That's risky, but i like it.
i hope it works.
yeah.
so you ready for the best sauce ever? - you know, actually, i can't stay.
I'm gonna meet shapiro, and i know you don't agree with me writing a story about chuck and his mother i don't believe in using other people to get what you want.
Shapiro loved the story.
He's writing me the recommendation for yale.
Congratulations.
I'm happy for ya.
I'm happy for you and your sister both.
I'm glad you're a musician and not an actor, dad, 'cause our family would have starved.
Save me some cold pasta? - i'll leave it on the stove for you.
all right.
Though it seems like just yesterday serena and i were 8 and playing dress-up in my mother's vintage manolos, my 18th birthday has finally arrived.
The party needs to be perfect, so blood orange martinis or beluga and belvedere? Why don't we make different drinks tonight and do a taste test? I can't.
I'm meeting my mother's new boyfriend.
Even moms have boyfriends, and i don't.
Cyrus has been one of my mom's attorneys since the divorce.
He asked her out when they first met but she didn't wanna mix business with pleasure.
Finally, his amorous overtures wore her down, and she agreed to dinner.
She's been smitten ever since.
Oh, that's so romantic.
One thing my mom has is good taste in men.
Maybe a dashing stepdad is just what i need.
Speaking of good taste in men, how's the sexy artist, serena? Aaron's amazing.
He's been sending me these maps to the most beautiful places.
The other day i ended up in a private room in the cloisters - overlooking the gardens.
spare them the details.
Hazel will kill herself from envy.
This is him again.
I gotta go.
what? What about my party? - blood orange martinis all the way.
You girls have been getting a lot of press.
you got talent.
Who's the designer? - it's me.
And i'm the face of the line and the brains behind the operation.
who do you imagine your client will be? - girls like us.
Sophisticated girls with a bit of edge who can afford high-end product, and i know these girls and their style because i'm their peer, so that's what makes me unique as a designer.
What's the name of the label? We haven't fully decided yet, clearly, but, it really doesn't matter, 'cause we're just here to take the work to the next level.
Definitely, which means finding a clear vision for the brand.
Which since fashion is a designer-based industry, and i'm a designer, that brand would be me.
No, the brand is the concept, which we both came up with.
Can we just talk about this later when we're alone, please? No, we're gonna talk about this now.
If mr.
Smith here wants to represent us, - then he should know who he's dealing with.
except mr.
Smith might get the wrong idea about our professionalism.
Then cut the crap and start acting professional instead of putting on the jenny show.
Me? Agnes, look at who's acting out yet again - in another business meeting.
you wanna see acting out? And yet another one bites the dust, agnes.
What is the matter with you? This guy was our last chance.
Okay, he totally overreacted.
I mean, we're artists.
We need to work with somebody who's not gonna be freaked out - by a little bit of passion.
passion? You know the heat from the fashion show's not gonna last that long.
I will find us another business manager tomorrow.
Good, because until we get one, we can't meet with any buyers.
Yes.
Okay? Now it's all gonna work out, all right? And i'm on it.
dorota.
dorota! Hurry up.
Cyrus will be here any minute.
He is the most attractive, brilliant man i have ever met.
darling, you're gonna love him.
i kind of already do.
I'm so excited to meet him.
I told you to put the roses on the table next to cyrus' seat.
Cary grant always looked his best with white roses.
Dorota, are you insane? - i don't know.
you used the everyday china.
Cyrus will think we're just common upper middle class.
go get the objet, and hurry up.
yes, miss blair.
Eleanor, you look like a goddess.
that must be his driver.
and you're more handsome than ever.
Not enough! Darling, come meet cyrus rose.
The lovely blair.
Come here! Not enough! Happy 20th anniversary for bass industries.
surprised you remembered.
not only did i remember i got you something.
You once told me that you snuck into hockey games as a kid, sat in the back row.
You bought a box for the season? I thought you could revisit your childhood passion in style.
We can go to rangers games together, hang out.
Nice gesture, but, misguided as usual.
I don't have time for hockey games.
You know that.
I always knew you had chops, humphrey.
here's your letter.
Have a seat.
thank you, sir.
Thank you so much.
Don't thank me yet.
There's more to come.
Meet james wolf, senior editor at "new york magazine.
" It's nice to meet you.
Shapiro took the liberty of showing me your piece.
I'm very interested.
I'm, i'm flattered.
"New york magazine" doesn't normally publish fiction.
it's not really fiction, though, is it? - i told james the trout character is based on chuck bass, son of bartholomew.
It's the 20th anniversary of bass industries.
We want an expos on the man behind the company.
You dated the stepdaughter.
You know the son.
Yeah, look, the last thing i need is bart bass as an enemy.
Yeah, and i'm really not the undercover type.
If you're afraid of the man's wrath, we won't print your name, but if your reporting's as good as your fiction, i'll assign you another piece.
Look, i'm sorry, sir, but he's not an idiot.
He's gonna know it came from me.
We'll only print something if it's true and can be verified.
If the man's clean, the story goes away.
If he's not, that's on him, isn't it? You just grew a pair, humphrey.
Don't lose them now.
This opportunity could open real doors for you.
What? How did you do that? I mean, it's amazing, but why? You know, i've shown you the most beautiful places i know, and now i'm showing the beautiful places you.
This is nothing, though.
I want you to pose for me.
will you? - sure, i guess.
Yes! Yes.
I can't believe this.
Spotted s.
And a.
Bringing sexy back to times square.
Move over, disney.
42nd street is steaming up.
I called you, like, ten times last night.
Where have you been? I went to the dentist at lunch and ,yesterday i met aaron in times square.
it was the most romantic thing.
who cares about plaque or pretentious artists when your best friend's having a meltdown? - he's totally unsuitable.
who is? Cyrus.
He's 5 feet tall.
He has a catchphrase, and he's a hugger.
I was expecting cary grant, and i got danny devito.
That sounds awful.
Sorry.
I gotta run.
Oh, aaron? Yeah.
He asked me to pose for him in his studio, to be his muse.
and you said yes? - why not? It's romantic.
No, it's a death trap.
Being the muse never works out.
Plenty of women have been both lover and muse to famous artists, like picasso.
Serena, a guy starts out in his blue period, and everything's great, but it's only a matter of time before he's all into cubism, and it's some other girl's eye coming out of her forehead.
I'm gonna go.
Wait! No, what about the gnome? I have to take him down.
B.
, enough already.
You always said you wanted to be an elegant woman at 18 like grace kelly.
You're right.
I'm going to be an adult.
I'll try and tolerate him.
Good girl.
This has been great.
Mr.
Bass, thank you for answering my questions.
anything for a friend of serena's.
as i mentioned, i'm just i'm kinda over the writing thing, and i wanna see what else is out there.
You're easily the most successful person i know, so i figured why not at the top, right? Yeah, i was hoping that i might be able to shadow you for just a few days a week after school.
I'm a busy man, daniel.
I don't think that's gonna be possible.
Yeah, of course.
I don't want to impose.
It's just you know my dad his world is pretty narrow.
He may have had a hit song in the '90s but he didn't build half the manhattan skyline.
Your father's a fine man, but, i can see how you'd want something more.
Why don't we start with two days a week? That's, that's more than enough.
Thank you.

  Agnes, it's 3
0.
I have been waiting up for you at the apartment since Will you lower your voice? Your high-pitched shrill is not helping my pounding head.
Excuse me? Waitress, can i get, a revive? Thank you.
Where the hell were you? I went out with max last night, and then we ran into some friends, and it was really good.
You should have come.
Then you should have answered your phone or at least turned it on so that you could hear the 50 messages i left you.
What are you, my mother? No, agnes, i am your partner! And you promised that you'd find us a new business manager today.
And i will do it on monday or today, if my hangover ever wears off.
Do you understand how much i've given up for this? - yes.
no, agnes, you don't.
I left home.
I quit my job, - and my dad he basically hates me.
you need to chill.
Take a xanax or a tequila shot or something.
Hi.
This is jenny humphrey.
I'm calling for scott smith.
Yeah, i know.
I met with him yesterday.
Well, again, thank you for your time.
It's been a pleasure, dan.
Listen, do you like hockey? Sure, yeah.
I was thinking maybe i could give you a business primer over a ranger game tuesday night.
What are you doing here? I'm sorry, sir.
I told him you were in a meeting.
I came by to have robert clear your schedule for the game.
apparently you already have a date.
what are you doing here? I'm newly interested in the construction business.
I thought i thought your dad could show me the ropes.
I was just leaving.
Thank you, mr.
Bass.
$18 a flower? That's absurd.
Yeah, yeah, it, it is a bit steep.
Yeah.
I'm an attorney, and i'm telling you, you're not paying for that peony.
You're paying for the florist's madison avenue rent.
I am grace kelly.
Grace kelly is me.
Blair, i would love to fill this whole penthouse with peonies for you for your birthday, but would you allow me to buy them someplace else? I mean, it's the principle of the thing.
I prefer to get my own peonies from my own florist, but thank you so much.
Eleanor, over dinner, you mentioned your fondness for cyndi lauper.
Mom and i love cyndi lauper.
We used to re-enact "girls just want to have fun.
" Our first dvd was "vibes.
" I got tickets to see cyndi lauper at joe's pub tomorrow night, and that way, your mother and i - will be out of your hair for the party.
my mother's coming to my party.
what? You never want me at your parties.
this year is different.
I'm 18, and it's a grown-up party.
I e-mailed dorota a new guest list.
parents are invited.
we'll return the tickets.
No, nonsense, nonsense.
Blair and i will celebrate her birthday on her real birthday next week.
We are going to see cyndi lauper! Thank you so much for giving me another chance.
My, ex-partner had some issues, so i've completely severed all ties with her.
I'm glad to hear it.
I'd be delighted to work with you alone.
Really? That's amazing.
I'm sure we can get started on the incorporation right away.
you are 18, aren't you? - actually, no, i'm 15.
that's not a problem, though, is it? - no, not at all.
We just have to get the papers signed by a parent, but that's simple, and then we're good to go.
Awesome.
Yeah, no problem.
You can stand right here.
thank you.
you're welcome.
So tell me, when you're ready.
I've been practicing my poses.
Okay, zoolander.
Just give me a second.
So what is it that you want? You want, like, a little bit of this? Or, like, you know, some of this? I don't know.
How about, how about a little less? You know, try being still.
Try nothing.
You can try that.
You can't hide your face.
That's no good.
I don't know what to do.
Can you say something? Okay, okay.
Put your head up here.
Put your feet up.
Really enjoy yourself.
Okay.
There you go.
Look over here.
that's too close.
Get outta here.
it's not too close.
I never thought i'd hear from you again.
Frankly, neither did i.
Are you still an intern - at "new york magazine"? - yeah.
Why? What do you know about a guy named dan humphrey? Nothing, except he's about to walk into a meeting with my boss.
I have to go.
I'll call you back.
Did brooklyn boy really think he could bury the bone in the backyard and no one would find it? Every bass will have his day.
Now how many muses come over in the morning bearing breakfast? Oh, my gosh.
You must have stayed up all night making that.
Pretty much.
What do you think? It's beautiful.
It's also kind of weird, maybe.
Not that it's weird, but it makes me feel that way, you know, seeing myself like this.
I should probably be more cool and mysterious and stop talking.
I kinda like being your inspiration.
Good.
Get used to it.
am i early? - no, actually, you're right on time.
Serena, this is danielle.
She models for me.
I thought modeling was our thing.
I'm doing a series.
I should go.
no, you don't have to.
yeah.
No, i do.
I have this thing that i forgot about - that i, i'm gonna do.
oh, can i have this coffee? Yes, yes.
Have have the coffee.
Noah, it's dan.
You know how i told you it might take a while to get anything good on bass? Turns out the story's not gonna take as long to crack as we thought.
You have glow, miss eleanor, like chinese lantern.
It's love, dorota.
How can you possibly love cyrus? He does all the things you hate.
He uses the wrong fork.
He slurps his soup.
He wears sports socks.
He's short and pushy.
he's nothing like daddy.
which is precisely why i like him.
Harold was lovely in a million ways, but he he had his secrets.
Cyrus is someone i can trust.
Before i go see cyndi lauper, i have to go pick up my dress at barneys.
I have to get my hair done.
Would you like to come with? No, thanks.
But have fun.
screw grace kelly.
I need to scheme.
oh, no.
That tiny man must have some big secret i can exploit, and with his trusting nature, finding it out shouldn't be too hard.
You're humphrey? I wasn't expecting a kid.
I'm sorry to disappoint, but no one else is showing up.
So if you got information, i'm right here.
All right, in '87, your friend bass bought a building in midtown to convert to condos.
The market crashed, and he couldn't raise the funds to complete it.
So wouldn't you know? That building burned down.
are you saying it wasn't an accident? - kinberg building.
Bass collects the insurance.
He goes on to build an empire.
It was just like in "all the president's men.
" Yeah, and i'm thinking there's no way this could be legit, but all of the facts check out the date, the building, the fire, the insurance, even.
and you're happy about this? - it's huge.
An arsonist? This article could change my life.
It could also change serena's life, lily's life, their whole family's.
I know, all right? And i feel badly about that, but if this is true, then people have the right to know.
Noah says all i need now is for me to get a statement from bart.
By tricking him into telling you information so you can exploit it.
Dad, i'm writing an important story for a quality publication.
Why can't you just admit this is a good thing for me? Hello, alison.
Jenny asked you to sign what papers? All right, thanks for having my back on this.
Talk to you later.
You and i are gonna talk more.
Now i have to go find jenny.
My mom is so happy.
I've never seen her like this.
Your mother is a diamond in an ocean of coal.
From the moment we met, i knew she was the one.
Have you always been so romantic? Like, with your ex-wife? Certainly not.
Actually, i've only felt like this once before in my life.
Tell me about it.
You know, alice and i were very young when we got married.
We were very fond of each other but never passionate.
And then i got drafted.
I was sent to vietnam.
And i fell deeply in love with a vietnamese girl named kim-ly.
It means "golden lion.
" How feline.
Go on.
I knew i could never stay married to alice if i could feel a passion like that for somebody else.
And i planned to bring kim-ly back to america.
But first, i had to go back by myself and end my marriage.
While i was breaking the news to alice, kim-ly was killed in a surprise attack on her village.
she died? - yeah.
So i was devastated.
But i always knew in my heart that what i'd felt for kim-ly was true love.
And i think i was too much of a romantic to stay forever in a loveless marriage.
So ultimately, alice and i parted as good friends.
I'd always hoped i could feel something like that again, and now i have with your mother.
Yeah.
My prayers have been answered.
Aaron.
Hey, it's me.
what's up? - it's such a beautiful day, i was thinking i could take you to one of my favorite spots for a change.
Have you ever been to the old puppet theatre in central park? That sounds great, but i'm still in the studio with danielle.
i'm sorry.
Are you still working? - no, no.
We're just hangin'.
Can, we do the puppet thing tomorrow? Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Looks like b.
's prophecy came true.
One day you're a muse.
The next, you're old news.
The caterers done setting up downstairs? Yes.
And what about you, my sneaky daughter? Are you done yet? What do you mean? Cyrus told me that you had lunch together, and he was very touched.
Of course, he doesn't know yet that you have an agenda for absolutely everything.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're not a child anymore.
But you can't help it, can you? You can't stop meddling and scheming.
Let me guess you played nice so that you could dig up some dirt on cyrus.
But it didn't work, did it? Because he is the most upstanding man i have ever met.
Sorry, mom.
It turns out that cyrus is just like daddy.
He cheated on his ex-wife.
He had an affair.
He fell in love with her.
I'm sorry.
It's true.
You can ask him yourself.
Yeah? This is scott smith's office calling for jenny humphrey.
This is agnes andrews.
Oh, i'm sorry.
I must have mixed up your phone numbers.
I'm about to see jenny right now.
Is there something you want me to tell her? Yes, please let her know the contracts are ready for j.
Humphrey designs.
i'll give her that message.
Thank you.
There's a totally cute guy over there.
The busboy? Beggars can't be choosers.
How's your totally cute boyfriend, serena? - he's not exactly my boyfriend.
you mean he's free? Hazel, i can hear your desperation from the other room.
Serena, what's wrong? I think you were right.
The whole muse thing kinda backfired.
I would say i told you so, but since i'm now 18, i'll refrain.
what happened? - we had this amazing night.
I modeled for him, and he did this incredible installation.
He totally loves you.
But then another girl showed up at the studio, and she modeled for him, and they've been hanging out all day.
So pablo's already moved on? That was faster than i thought.
It's okay, s.
It's actually a good thing.
This way, you can get out before you're in too far.
You just missed your dad.
he was ringing the buzzer for an hour.
my dad? Wait, what are you doing with my dresses? When i let you in, i had no idea you'd be such a little thief stealing my contact list and our whole business.
i wasn't stealing, agnes - you know, you think you're so - talented and unique, don't you? - no, i don't.
Three weeks ago, you were absolutely nothing.
You were a little intern pinning my hem.
It was my idea to do the fashion line.
I found the photographer and the models for the fashion shoot.
It was also my idea for the guerilla fashion show, and i have all the contacts! I know.
You're right, okay? You're right.
Just give me my dresses, please.
Do you know how many "talented" artists there are living in brooklyn designing dresses? Agnes, give me my dresses! What are you doing?! These dresses are as much mine as they are yours.
now they belong to nobody.
are you totally insane? Yes, i'm insane, jenny! What are you doing? Agnes? Don't! Agnes, please! These dresses are everything! They're my entire future! You are out of your mind! What the hell did you do, agnes?! You did this! Now by the time i get back, i want you and your crap out of my apartment.
It was good to see you.
The mythical serena.
You must be cyrus, eleanor's boyfriend.
How did you know who i was? Well, i recognized you from aaron's studio.
You know aaron? - he's my son! - wh oh, my goodness.
You didn't catch the family resemblance? No, it's okay.
You know, i think he's quite smitten with you.
Really? I'm not so sure.
He told me that he took you to the cloisters.
He definitely doesn't do that with just anyone.
I'm actually gonna go stop by his studio to see him now, but it was really nice meeting you.
Likewise.
oh, eleanor.
did yo cheat on your ex-wife? - well, did you? Is it true? - yes, it is.
Get out.
I thought he was different.
I have to go lie down.
there are so many hot guys here.
my god.
Look at that guy.
Cyndi lauper? What are you doing here? My pal cyrus called me yesterday.
He bought out my gig and asked me to play this girl's birthday party insad.
I guess he's madly in love with her mother.
I'm looking for a blair waldorf.
How do you do? Make yourself at home.
Dorota! This is dorota.
She's your biggest fan.
Oh, my.
Miss lauper! Wait! Miss blair, where are you going? I wanted a harry winston choker for my birthday.
Instead, i got a conscience.
I gotta go.
Sorry to bother you at home, sir.
What was it you wanted to speak to me about? Something kind of strange happened while i was at your office.
I overheard this guy talking about you to an employee.
He said that you were responsible for a fire in one of your own buildings.
He had a lot of details.
I figured there must be some kind of explanation, if it even happened, which, i'm sure it didn't.
And look, i know it's none of my business.
I'm sorry.
But he was so insistent, i figured if he was telling people at work, he he could be telling other people, too.
So it's out.
I've had that man's death on my conscience for 20 years.
Wait.
Someone died? Dad, don't say anything else.
He's writing a story for a magazine.
So what's it gonna cost to make this go away? I don't want your money.
If you use this against my father, i will destroy you.
Chuck, what happened is bigger than you hating me or me trying to make it as a writer.
I couldn't ignore this if i wanted to.
It will ruin our family.
Don't do it.
Please.
You're still here.
I sent my driver to dinner because i thought i'd be at the party ringing in your birthday.
You threw in the towel rather easily.
I expected a harder fight.
I'm smart enough to know that getting into a war with eleanor's daughter is never gonna result in a victory.
So you retreated with dignity.
Who says i gave up? Oh, my god.
You outmaneuvered me.
You deliberately let me win, counting on the fact that cyndi lauper would prey on my emotions.
I'm a lawyer.
I do think a few moves ahead.
Some of us can't rely entirely on our looks, you know.
Well done.
not enough.
fine.
You're a genius.
You better be good to my mother, or i'll be coming for you.
Those are fair terms.
Now come upstairs and stand next to me while i tell my mom the whole truth about the golden lion.
She'll be furious with me, so i may need an attorney.
You're not what i had in mind.
Well, you're not what i had in mind.
Sir? This was left for you with the concierge downstairs.
I'm sorry i'm interrupting your "work.
" Serena, i thought i was seeing you tomorrow.
Excuse me.
Right, because you're seeing danielle tonight.
I'm seeing a lot of people.
You and i just started hanging out, okay? Did i miss a talk where we decided to be exclusive? Look, i don't know how it works in high school, but i like to date more than one person at once.
You're free to see other people, too.
Thank you for the condescending lecture, but that's not really my thing.
Hey, dad.
Can i come in? Of course you can, jenny.
This is your home.
i'm happy to have you back.
i'm not back yet, but i will be if you sign these papers.
The papers your mother already refused to sign? She only refused because she didn't want to get in the middle.
And here i thought you'd come to your senses.
You don't even have your coat off, and you're already using - emotional blackmail to get your way.
spin it however you like.
if i sign this paper, it means that - everything you've done up to now this lying, cheating, manipulation it's all okay.
And if you don't sign it, then everything i've done everything is all for nothing.
I won't put my name on a piece of paper condoning who you've become.
Fine.
Then i'll just have to find another way.
What other way? You gonna sleep on agnes' couch till you turn 18? If that's what it takes.
Poor little orphan jenny.
Looks like she needs a daddy warbucks.
But daddy warbucks don't grow on trees at least not on a tree that grows in brooklyn.
Mr.
Smith? Hi.
Yeah, sorry to bother you on a sunday.
Is there any way that we can meet at your office today? Can i come in? I can't stop you.
I want to apologize, son.
Apologize? I never blamed you for your mother's death.
I read that short story that, dan humphrey wrote about you and your mother.
I had no idea you felt that way.
It's my fault.
I know i've had trouble being close to you.
But it's not for the reasons you think.
It's just hard because every time i look at you, i see her.
you miss her.
you have no idea.
I've made some terrible mistakes in my life but i don't want to make another.
I want to know my son.
So any, interest in going to that hockey game? I'll clear my calendar.
I spoke to your sister.
My, plan didn't exactly pan out.
I heard.
She called me.
You've been thinking about that story on bart bass? Yeah.
i took your advice and killed it.
you saved that family.
I think it's time you saved ours, dad.
It's so important to you to be right.
That's a trait i inherited.
I'd be the first to say it.
But you you need to get jenny back, even if it means letting her win.
So what's the urgent question? Neither of my parents will sign the papers.
What else can i do? You have one other option, but it's extreme.
You could file a suit to become emancipated.
What's that mean? You'd be empowered to be your own guardian.
Your legal ties with your family would be severed.
You mean divorce my parents? Okay.
What do i need to do? I can't believe aaron is cyrus' son.
Of course, you get the prince, and i get stuck with the toad.
It doesn't look like i'm gonna have the fairy tale ending.
I went to have a talk with aaron yesterday.
and? - instead, he had a talk with me.
I really tried to deal with the casual dating thing but i guess it's just not for me.
Of course not, because beneath that free spirit facade, you're totally conventional, just like i am.
It's not a facade.
I believe in freedom, people following their hearts, doing what they want.
You know i always wish i'd lived in the '60s.
You believe in long hair, peasant skirts and sandals, but you in an open relationship? I don't think so.
Speaking of relationships, how are you faring with cyrus and eleanor? He's not exactly my cup of tea, but he makes my mother happy, and - he's not that bad.
i'm proud of you.
It's not like i have to see him that often.
He'll come to pick her up for dinner once, twice a week.
have to go.
bye.
Darling, we have some wonderful news.
Thanks to you, blair, we've been up all night talking about love and death and the brevity of life.
And we have decided that he should move in today.
Some surprises hit you over the head like a squash racket.
And others sneak up on you when you're least expecting it.
What are you doing here? I'm picking you up for an afternoon of puppet theater in the park.
But we broke up last night, remember? Wait, how did how did we break up if we're not going out? Thanks for reminding me.
That feels good.
Serena, i really like you.
Even though i grew up on the upper east side, i don't want the same life that my parents had social obligations and forced conversations, saying no to all the things that i wanted to say yes to.
I thought you felt the same way.
And if i was wrong, i apologize.
No.
No, you were right.
Wait.
What are you doing? Don't you want to get dressed? Nope.
And sometimes the biggest surprises are the ones you spring on yourself.
Come on.
Scampering about in a slip is one way to shed old skin.
But will embracing free love be as easy as flinging off a pair of fendi flats? Looks like someone's going barefoot in the park.
X.
o.
x.
o.
, gossip girl.
Gossip girl is here--your one and only source Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's Elite.
I like to date more than one person at once You're free to see other people, too.
Did you hire someone to look into my past Do you have a lily bass dossier? Lily I want to see it.
I won't put my name on a piece of paper Condoning who you've become.
Then I'll just have to find another way.
Well, you have one other option.
You could file a suit to become emancipated.
You mean divorce my parents? The captain is being charged with embezzlement and fraud.
You're skipping town? I'm gonna be a much better father to you From dominica than I will be from jail.
For the rest of the country, thanksgiving is when families Come together to give thanks, but on the upper east side, The holiday thankfully returns to its roots-- Lying, manipulation and betrayal.
And from what we hear, just like the indians, Someone else is being pushed out of their home.
Not only are cyrus' moving boxes everywhere, But so are his annoying relatives.
But they can't be that bad.
Aaron always talks about his nana.
Oh, Sylvia? You know, she kissed me on the cheek She left a big, orange lipstick mark.
It looked like I'd been spray-tanned.
And cyrus' nephew spent the morning talking to me About corn, grain of the future.
And his sister asked me to go shopping with her.
Oh, that's sweet.
At century 21.
Ugh.
The horror.
But even though daddy isn't coming, I'm determined to have The perfect thanksgiving I didn't get last year.
You're still gonna help me make his famous pie tomorrow? Yeah, but I can only stay for a couple hours.
Aaron is coming to meet my family Before thanksgiving dinner.
And how do you plan to introduce him? "mom, you d.
V.
R.
'big love.
' this is aaron, "and he's just like bill paxton, Only younger and with scruff.
" I'm serious.
The serena I know would never want to share A guy she really liked with anyone else.
Well, I'll admit, it's been hard.
I-i like him enough that I don't want to date anyone else.
And you can't get the prize if you don't compete, right? There's so many things wrong with that sentence.
Ugh.
Here comes your ghost of boyfriends past to haunt me.
Please try to be civil.
Okay.
Pfft.
Hey, have either of you seen jenny? Oh, if she's hiding from you, She has better taste than I thought.
I tried.
My dad has been calling her cell, And he's been trying her friend agnes' place, And she's just not returning any of his messages.
I was looking for eric.
Um, the headmaster said he left early, so Well, she has been spending A lot of time with him over at the apartment.
Well, Look, if you see her, could you please just tell he To call us back, because I would love this cold war of theirs To end before the holidays.
Speaking of, happy thanksgiving.
You, too.
I'm gonna miss your dad's mashed potatoes, but not the drama.
Yeah, well, this year's gonna be a little quieter, I guess, Especially if jenny doesn't show.
Uh, i-i guess I'll see you after the break.
Yeah.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, sorry.
Not as sorry as I am.
Archibald, I haven't seen you around here lately.
Why do you care? Oh, I don't.
If you're not with the humphreys anymore, Obviously things are looking up, which is too bad.
I kind of liked watching you slum it.
I thought it would teach you who your real friends were.
Well, I guess it has.
I need to be sure you understand what emancipation means.
I do.
I've been researching it.
She's made me watch "irreconcilable differences, Like, 15 times.
Once you file, the state opens up An investigation into your family.
There has to be proof of parental neglect.
Just fill out these papers authorizing the investigation.
Once you sign them, your parents will be notified.
Wait.
They have to be notified? Well, of course.
They need to know you no longer want to be their child.
Okay.
Thank you.
Let's go.
So what are you doing for your holiday? I decided to pass On joining my family at the washoe reservation, Where they're helping to stage a protest.
And my plan is to hole myself up in my studio, Rent "berlin alexanderplatz" And eat a frozen annie's organic turkey dinner.
Oh! Well, god, you know, no one enjoys a 16-hour german movie More than yours truly, but, uh, you could come here instead.
I don't really feel like seeing jenny.
Well, I'm pretty sure she's not coming, So you can take her chair.
I didn't realize it was still that bad Between her and your dad.
Where is she having thanksgiving? With nate? No, uh, nate and jenny aren't spending time together anymore.
Uh, so how about it? A fassbinder and freezer-free thanksgiving at my place? Well, when you put it that way I know.
Agnes' mother just told me that agnes is On a modeling assignment in tokyo, And she hasn't seen jenny for a week.
Then where is she? I don't know.
I think I have to call the cops.
You know, uh, when I asked serena this afternoon She said that jenny's Been spending a lot of time with eric.
Eric! Serena! Charles! We're home! So much for coming home a day early.
We should have stayed on necker island With dick and bono.
Right? Is my daughter there? Well, rufus, hello to you, too.
No, no one's here.
Why would you think your daughter would be? Is she with eric? Well, I certainly hope so.
I'm pretty sure she's been with him all week.
What do you mean, all week? What, you don't really believe she's been staying I'm gonna call you right back.
It was nice of the roths to let us stay at their place While they're in aspen.
Very.
If they hadn't offered to help, I'm not sure what we would have done.
We don't have a lot of options left, nate.
Yeah, I kind of noticed.
But I'm hoping that is about to change.
Son, I missed you so much.
Just like nate archibald, Gossip girl has a family waiting for her today, So although I'd love to stay and chat, I'm signing off until after thanksgiving dinner-- Just in time for pie, coffee and surveying the damage.
My life in dominica is Well, it's good.
We moved some money offshore before I left, Enough to get a house on the ocean.
Weather's always perfect.
People are nice.
I'm so happy you're living it up in the caribbea While we're squatting with no heat in New york.
Hear your father out, nate I want to make things better.
I know how hard your life has been because of what I did.
I can't turn back the clock, But I can ask you to come live with me.
All the money in the world isn't worth it Without the two of you to share it with.
Mom, did you know about this? Yes, and I'd like to go, But only if you want to come, too.
Please, nate.
We can be a family again.
All you have to do is say yes.
I didn't know she was there until today.
I called serena.
She didn't even know.
Eric must have been sneaking her in at night.
Let's just go wait for her.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
The last time I saw you and jenny together, It didn't go very well, and you don't seem to have Changed your mind about anything.
She's my daughter.
If I want to see her, you're not gonna change my mind.
I'm not trying to.
It's just that I haven't seen jenny yet Let me talk to her, see where her head is at.
If there's one thing I have learned about teenage girls, Is that sometimes they need someone Outside of their family to talk to.
A-all that might be true, but it's thanksgiving Jenny needs to be with family.
She is.
She's with mine.
Once you've calmed down, and she's ready to talk, I'll arrange a meeting.
Marshmallows.
Jenny likes 'em on her, uh, sweet potatoes.
I'm so glad to have the house to myself.
Cyrus took my mother to jean-georges for dinner.
God knows why.
Where's warren jeffs? He's, um, making dinner for us, Which would be completely romantic and amazing, Except when I asked him where he was today, He said he was hanging out with a friend.
I know I'm probably being completely neurotic, But ali could think of was, was this friend a girl, A girl he kisses? A woman needs to be with a man who thinks of only her.
Anything else is a nonstarter.
Tell him how you feel.
Dorota, more flour.
Are you baking already? I thought we were supposed to do that tomorrow.
I needed a little tradition of my own to keep me grounded.
It turns out the rose family has a restaurant thanksgiving.
You know, b.
, the thing about traditions is You can make new ones.
For all you know, You could like his family dinner more than your own.
Ready.
Oh.
That's-- that's my cue to go.
Remember, serena doesn't share.
Remember, blair should learn to.
Bart, you're home earl so are you.
Chuck said he thought you were going out with jonathan tonight.
Yeah, so did i.
Huh.
They're home early.
Don't come up! So how were things while we were away? Not so good.
I don't think it's working out with jonathan.
What do you know about someone at your school named ben shurn? Um, he's the, uh, The--the captain of jonathan's swim team.
Why? Just Maybe you might want to ask jonathan What he was doing monday night.
You're home.
My plans for the evening got held up at customs.
Your dad just insinuated That jonathan might be dating someone else.
How and why would he know that? He has a p.
I.
On retainer, like I do.
I get that for business, But for family and friends of family, it's just creepy.
Not to worry.
Bart's people are top-notch and very discreet.
At our old place, he had this safe with files on everybody, From staff to senators.
When I was 13, I found the most amazing surveillance photos Of gina, my hot italian au pair.
Those photos--and gina-- changed my life.
Yeah, but what if I don't want my life to change? What else does he know? How much do you want to find out? This is so good.
But candles and home cooking? What's with the romance? Bound to give the girl the wrong idea.
Well, or the right one.
I've had an incredible time with you these past few weeks.
Honestly, uh, you're all I ever think of.
Really? Oh.
I mean, that's flattering.
You're, of course, welcome to see other people.
That's your choice.
But, uh, as of right now, this moment, I'm officially a 1-woman man.
Wow.
A 1-woman man? If--if I would have known we were celebrating, I would have brought a bottle of champagne.
Well, actually, I'm-- I'm kind of glad you didn't.
Um, I also wanted to talk to you About the fact that, uh, I'm sober.
Oh.
I feel a lot better.
My--my work is a lot better since I stopped drinking.
I just need to be around people that are gonna keep me On the right track, not tempt me over to the dark side.
The dark side.
Right.
Well, I used to party Every now and then.
No.
No.
But that-- that was so long ago.
So it's--it's, you know, E-except for the occasional celebratory glass of champagne, I, um, I'm pretty much a teetotaler now.
So you can count on me.
I'm--i'm--i'm the right girl for the job.
Well, i-i figured.
The kids need to tell us things when they happen, Not after they get caught.
The only way to protect them is To know what they're up to at all times.
Don't you agree? Yes, but ithis case, it's complicated.
Well, I certainly hope you grounded eric Well, not yet, but-- where are you off to? Uh, I just have to get to-- to go find jenny and tell her that we know She's been staying here? How about you bring her back here? Because I would love to talk to her.
Blair, this is delicious.
I must get the recipe.
But you know what? The ratio of cinnamon to nutmeg--not enough.
Mother? Yes? Why are you letting cyrus ruin everything? It's all about his family and his traditions And his notes on my pie.
Oh, honey, calm down.
You know, you always think the--the worst of people.
Cyrus made reservations for dinner At your favorite restaurant, the gramercy tavern.
So he's having the chef make your favorite recipes-- Oyster stuffing that you like.
That's not the point, mother.
The point is That thanksgiving is a family holiday, And this is our family now.
Now you get with the program, and fast.
I hope there's some of that pie left for me.
Is there? Huh? Oh! Oh! Gimme.
Mmm! Dorota, everything's awful.
I know thing you want to know, miss blair, But I not supposed to tell.
Who do you work for? Spill it.
Your mother make me keep this safe until tomorrow.
Keep what safe? Mr.
Rose propose this evening at dinner.
They be telling everyone at thanksgiving, When whole family is there.
I saw your father today.
Yeah, I had a feeling.
I know you both need some time, So i-i convinced him to let you stay here for a while.
And when you're ready, I would love to help you talk to him And make things right.
Thanks for the offer.
I really--i appreciate it, But, um, you don't know how he's been, so Jenny, he's your father, And he loves you so much.
And at least for the next couple years, You belong at home with him.
Thank you, mrs.
Bass, For letting me stay here and everything, But I'm pretty tired, so I'm Okay, well, get some rest.
We can talk some more tomorrow.
Oh, jenny So you're okay with it, jenny not being with us tonight? If, uh, by "okay," you mean extraordinarily depressed, Then yes.
I miss her a lot.
You know, in the all arguments you two have been having, I haven't once heard you tell her that.
Oh, my god.
You're right.
It's not that rare, is it? Aaron, what are you doing here? Uh, I live right around the corner.
I'm just picking something up to take to, um Oh, no.
It's--it's all right.
I can hear her name.
Serena's.
Uh, you know what? I'm just gonna go and see if there are any pecans left.
So, um, you know, could you do me a favor And say hi to serena's family for me? 'cause we all spent last thanksgiving together.
Yeah, ablutely.
Except bart, actually.
There was this, uh, this crazy thing with, uh, With my dad and her mom and my mom, and it was, I guess, Like all things in serena's life, It's very complicated.
Serena's life is complicated Uh, well, yeah.
I-i don't know about you, But the serena I know has long, flowing blonde hair, Towers over both of us.
Is--is that the same one? I just don't see her as complicated.
So would you say that they're cheddar people or more goat-y? Oh, serena's not that big into cheese.
I think you might want to go with the, uh, Wines of southern France.
Well, I guess you don't know her as well as you think you do She doesn't drink anymore.
Oh, sure.
I mean, not problematically, of course I mean, at least not for months.
Wait.
Months? Yeah, well, y-you know, the thing in the spring With georgina? You two are getting serious.
I'm sure you guys talked about that.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Uh, I'm, uh, I'm gonna go pay for this.
Mother Is there anything you want to tell me? Oh, yes, actually, there is, And I will tell you tonight at the restaurant Once everyone is assembled for dinner.
Of all the things you've done, mother, This is one of the worst.
I'm your daughter.
Lumping me in with everyone else to hear the news? I don't know what news you are referring to, blair.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go check The reservations for dinner.
Dorota, get it together.
We're leaving.
If I'm just like anyone else to her, Doubt she'll notice I'm not at dinner.
But it's your favorite holiday.
Not anymore.
Nate? Hey, vanessa.
I didn't expect to see anyone here.
I had some paperwork to catch up on.
I thought, it's thanksgiving.
It'd be quiet.
Why are you here? Oh, I borrowed this pixies box set from rufus.
I, um, I was gonna return it.
I wrote a thank-you note.
If you could give it to him, That'd be--that'd be nice.
Why didn't you take it by the loft Well, I think dan likes me About as much as you do right now, so Look, you and chuck and dan-- I've somehow managed to alienate everyone.
If you could just give rufus the cds And--and the thank-you note, I'd really appreciate that.
Of course.
And, vanessa, listen.
Uh Take care of yourself.
All right? My new boyfriend aaron is on his way here to meet everyone, And I want your word on something.
If you're talking about the dress, I say "higher.
Chuck, I want you word that you will not mention anything About the girl I used to be.
I just got aaron to myself, And if the one thing I have to do to keep it that way Is hide my recent history for a while, Then that's what I'm gonna do.
I get it.
You lied to him.
N--no, I didn't.
I merely chose not to tell him everything I ever did.
And it will come out naturally, Over the course of the many conversations we're gonna have, As we're dating exclusively.
You have my word, whatever that's worth.
Where are you going? Eric's waiting for me in my father's study.
We're having a business meeting.
Oh, my god! You're here! "hey"--that was so not on the same level as my hi.
Uh, I bumped into dan at the store.
Uh, he just said something.
I'm trying to figure it out.
Figure what out? Something about a girl named georgina? What? What--what's, um, he even talking about? That's, uh, Gosh.
Um Well, you know, he's-- he's probably just jealous.
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, he was talking a lot about Thanksgiving last year when you two were together, so Yeah.
Well, I guess he's just not as over me As I thought he was.
But--but seriously, Aaron, the next time he starts to tell you stories about me-- No, no, no, no.
Never again.
No, it's not gonna happen again.
Could you? Oh, it, uh, says "lily.
" What's going on? Is something wrong? I've been grappling with what to do all day-- What to say, which one of you to talk to first.
Is jenny okay? Yes, but you might not be.
I know it is thanksgiving, But I think you should get here right away.
Lily? I will see you soon.
Come on.
We're going.
Vanessa's coming over.
Call and cancel.
Vanessa abrams.
Can I help you? I'd like to talk to you about nate archibald.
Are you going to open it? I don't know.
I'll tell you the combination.
It's like the end of every heist movie ever made.
Are those gold bars? I didn't think they actually made those.
Is that-- is that a sat phone? Encryption.
Government prototype.
Put it back.
I knew you'd come back for more.
Chuck, you know how hard this cal was for me to make.
I'm listening.
The fbi just came to see me, And nate's in trouble.
Tell someone who cares Chuck, this is serious.
He needs our help.
Where are you? The gallery.
Sorry, kid.
I have to do something.
Yeah.
Happy hunting.
Okay.
Don't you dare answer that blackberry, dorota.
But it's your mother, and it's thanksgiving And we have nothing to be thankful for.
This is the worst thanksgiving of all time, And if we have to wander the upper east side Like outcasts in a jane austen novel, so be it.
Maybe we can go feed ducks at boat pond Like when you were little.
Fine.
I'm not a monster.
I won't deny the ducks their dinner.
But if you look like you enjoy even one second of it, We're leaving.
Oh, no.
None for me, thank you.
Mom.
Serena, it's a special occasion.
No, I'm only 17.
Well, that's never stopped you.
Uh, no.
No, I said no, thank you, okay? Oh.
Uh, mom, have you shown aaron your beautiful art collection? Oh, yeah.
Um, was that a jessica craig-martin I saw over there? Why, yes, it is, aaron.
Good eye.
I know.
Yeah, I'll--i'll be right back.
I My shoes are killing me.
This is crazy, jen.
These are e-mails of mine, photographs, Notes from my psychiatrist at the ostroff center.
So much for doctor/patient confidentiality, huh? What about serena's and your mom's? I can't bear to open them.
These are Five times the size of mine.
I'm sorry.
Um, speaking about seeing things, Have you seen my emancipation papers? Because they're not in my bag, And I really don't want anyone to find Them.
Eric? Jenny? Are you two up there Come on downstairs.
Be social.
Uh, yeah.
We're coming.
Has chuck finally decided to grace us with his presence? Actually, um What's he doing here? I invited him.
Hi, mr.
Bass.
Daniel.
Aaron, hey, man.
Well, if it isn't the last person I wanted to see.
Wh--i'm--i'm sorry? Why'd you lie about serena? Oh, my god.
Where is she? She should be right down.
Dad? Dan.
And aaron.
Hey.
What's up? Well, your boyfriend called me a liar.
Did--did--did I lie about something? You know, dan, maybe you and I should talk in private, To discuss who said what to whom And why they felt compelled to say it? Yeah, uh, that's-- we don't need to do that.
She's right.
I lied.
Yeah, well, it's not cool, man.
If you have a problem with me dating your ex, At least be honest about it.
You're right.
I'll be honest.
Yeah.
Serena, I'm sorry, but I'm already late To meet my father at the waldorfs'.
Bye.
You didn't exactly tell him the truth.
Well, you didn't exactly have to.
You know, I'm sorry.
I thought--i thought he knew.
I really did.
Well, he didn't, and he doesn't I'm sorry.
I-i panicked, And I was mad at you.
No, i-i should have kept my mouth shut.
But really, serena? I mean, You're g--you have to tell him everything.
If there's one thing that weearned this past year See, around here, the truth always comes out.
Oh, uh, it just did.
You know, when you called, I thought it was an emergency.
Obviously I was wrong.
It's more like an intervention.
There's someone you need to talk to.
The fbi knows that your dad's in town, And they think he's about to commit a crime Even worse than fraud or embezzlement.
Like what? Like extortion and kidnapping.
When your father escaped to dominica, He could only get his hands on enough money To get himself set up.
He should have found a job, reinvented himself.
But instead, he lid the way he'd always lived.
Now he's got nothing left.
Yeah, well, if my father's poor, What's the point of us going to live with him? I mean, we don't have any money.
But the vanderbilts do.
Yeah, look, why would my grandparents pay us To go live with him when they can't even help us out here? I mean, they hate my dad.
Maybe that's why they would give him money-- To leave without you or your mom.
We've been monitoring your father's calls.
He's trying to get in touch with your Grandparents.
W-well, I mean, if this is true Why didn't you just come tell me this yourself? We didn't know if you or your mother knew what was going on.
After all, she helped him escape in the First place.
But I told him I didn't thin That you would just leave new york.
Especially without saying good-bye to your friends I'll let the three of you talk it over.
This is just too much.
There is still a chance that the captain can get away, If that's what you want.
But you could also end it all now.
How? By turning your father in.
I'm sorry I didn't call you back, okay? A lot has been happening.
Agnes kicked me out.
She burned all my dresses, And then I had to crash with eric.
I had nowhere else to go.
And I couldn't tell anyone I was living here Because then they'd tell you, and you'd be really mad.
I'm not.
I'm out of angry.
Miss you too much.
Dad, please don't try to guilt trip me right now, okay? Your brother helped me realize That I haven't told you something--something important.
What? I love you, jenny.
I love you so much, I'm willing to let you go If that's what it's gonna take to get you back.
And when the time comes for a court hearing, I won't stand in your way.
But there's nothing you can do to make me stop loving you.
I'm sorry.
S father just left to look for jenny, So maybe now would be the perfect time for you To tell me what the hell's been going on here today, lily.
You first.
Where did you get those? It doesn't matter.
Did you read these? Not yet.
Only mine.
None of you were supposed to-- find them? I can't believe this.
You did this to me, and I dealt with it.
But the kids? My kids? Mom, you knew about this We'll talk about that later.
I'm just trying to protect them.
If you're gonna let your son and daughter Go where they please and do as they please, Someone has to look out for them.
There's a difference between looking out for them And treating them like criminals in their own home.
How do you expect them to trust us if we don't trust them? God.
Okay, kids, let's go.
Where are you going? Oh, well, this day is about family, And if you're not for this family, Then I'm gonna take mine and spend it with them.
Where have you been? Your mother's almost done packing.
We have to go.
Do you really think your plan's gonna work? Well, it will if we hurry up.
Come on.
Let's go No, I don't mean that.
Are you really planning On holding me and mom for ransom? Not all the money's for me, nate.
It's for you guys, too.
Look, this way, you and your mom will get everything you deserve, And I will have enough to start over wherever I go next.
Look, I want to take care of you, T i-i don't know what else to do.
No, There's a dierent way to get our lives back, dad One that doesn't require another felony.
The fbi are on the way here.
Nate, please-- Dad, listen.
I love you, But if you can't do the right thing, Then I can't respect you.
So the choice is yours.
You go out that service entrance And you ruin our relationship forever Or you be a man And you turn yourself in when they get here.
Well, that's not a choice.
It is a choice, Because I'm sick of living in the mess You've created for us, and I'm not gonna do it anymore.
I hope you won't either.
The annual van der woodsen diner thanksgiving dinner.
Hmm.
We should have a standing reservation.
I think we do.
What errand did serena have to run? I don't know, but she took her file with her.
Maybe she went to burn it.
I don't blame her.
I should have burned mine.
I lied before.
I read it.
Eric, whatever you read, um-- I can't believe you didn't tell me You were in an institution like me.
You were 19.
You were just a few years older than I was, And after everything I went through last Year Maybe I should have said something But I wanted to be strong for you.
Plus, I really wasn't ready to revisit it.
I look forward to talking about it When you're ready.
It takes time.
I should know.
How did you get so wise? The nanny.
Okay.
How about we have a real thanksgiving dinner? It's not too late.
What'd you have in mind? Well, come on.
And-- oh, serena.
I-i was hoping that you were blair.
Oh, why? Where is she? Maybe you can find out.
She's ignoring all our calls.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe she will take yours.
Would you mind? Yeah, of course.
I'll let you know as soon as I hear back from her.
Thank you.
Is aaron here? He's over there.
I think he's Thank you.
Yes.
Serena, hey.
Hey.
Dan didn't lie.
I did.
It was more of a lie of omission, but still.
I-i-i'm sorry I didn't tell you everything.
If you still want to be with me after, then let me know.
She's on 5th and 71st.
Oh, thank you.
Happy thanksgiving.
Happy thanksgiving, dear.
What are you doing? My dad and I got in a fight, I was crashing at eric's, and he finally chased me down.
You're lucky.
You have a family who fights for you.
Mine doesn't even care if I'm there.
Well, your mom loves you in her own way, blair.
But the way your father loves you--i never had that.
My own dad, as sweet as he is, isn't here.
Your father Will go anywhere for you, anytime.
I know because I've sometimes even made it happen.
What? What? Is it my hair? No.
You're just wrong.
Jenny.
You look cold.
Here.
Come home, dear.
You've made your point.
I don't think I have.
Well, I think that you might feel differently When you find out what I have been waiting to show you.
I'll come Yes.
On one condition-- Jenny has to go home, too.
Well, I think that's a terrific idea.
Everyone should be where they belong on thanksgiving-- With their families.
Now--oh! Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
We'll drop you.
What's going on? I love you both.
I'm proud of you.
No, don't.
Let me.
Howard, no.
What's going on? What are you doing, howard? I'll be--i'll be okay.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can And will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to have an attorney present.
Hey.
We were hoping you'd be here.
My mom's inside, signing papers in the dark.
We got our house back.
Now all we need is some electricity.
But look, i, um, I can't thank you guys enough.
I'm gonna give you guys a moment.
I Didn't want you to go.
And I don't like to admit it, But I still Still? It's not important.
Um, there's the whole thing with jenny, And I don't want to get in the way of that.
Vanessa, i-i haven't heard from jenny in weeks, so If you'd like, I mean, uh, can we get together sometime? I guess that'd be okay.
Cool.
Call me.
I will.
By the way, I'm glad you stayed, too.
Thanks, man.
No, let's, uh, let's get drunk instead.
Daddy.
Oh, sweetheart.
Oh! Oh, honey.
Mwah.
I would have come sooner.
There was a t.
G.
V.
Strike.
Wait.
This is the surprise? I thought you were getting engaged.
Well We are.
I-i wanted your father to meet cyrus Before we told everyone.
If he didn't approve Of the man who might become your stepfather, I couldn't quite marry him, could i? Well, now that the cat's out of the bag, I-i think this calls for a celebration.
Mm-hmm.
Dessert first, I always say.
Thank you, dorota.
Are you hungry? I guess I'm ready for a new tradition.
I was kind of hoping she'd be here.
Yeah.
I was, too.
You are.
I love you, too, dad.
I don't--i don't want to not be your daughter.
Guys, I can't breathe.
Good.
Good.
I don't need to read that.
No, i-i think you do.
Anything you want to tell me you can tell me yourself.
I want to know you, No matter what you've done or how long ago.
Is anyone home? Hey.
What are you doing here? I don't know.
It's thanksgiving, And I couldn't think of anywhere that felt more like home.
I'm glad to see that you couldn't either.
E.
, call serena.
I left a message already.
Oh, good.
What about bart? Not coming.
All right.
Well, dinner's way behind schedule, so, uh, Who wants to start cooking? I do.
Hey, vanessa.

Are they for me? Yes.
Thank you.
Oh, they smell real good.

Look at that.
Hi.
I'm glad you're back.
I thought you were still mad at me.
I was.
Look, I'm really Really sorry about nate.
I mean, if it's any consolation, I don't think he ever really liked me anyway.
I mean, I haven't heard from him in weeks, so Well, our friendship is more important than some guy, right? Yeah.
So let's just eat some turkey and put it behind us.
Okay.
I missed you.
Oh, I missed you, too.
I call dibs on mashed potatoes.
Hey.
Oh, jen, your mail's been piling up here.
It's mostly catalogs, but still, you gotta sift through it.
Okay.
Before you get going on that, You care to help me find the marshmallows? Absolutely.
Dan, you think you can handle the Cranberry sauce? Oh, god.
Yeah.
I feel like i.
.
Remember how to work that? A letter from Nate for Jenny As the end of another holiday draws near, I'd like to take a moment To list all the things I'm thankful for.
I'm thankful that no matter how dark things might get, Old friendships can still be rekindled I'm thankful for new relationships That help us realize how far we've come from who we were And how close we get when we can really be ourselves.
I'm thankful to know that no matter what they say All right.
You can go home again, Whether it's your home or not.
Andrew, bart bass.
I know I told you Not to look into why my wife was in that sanatorium, But I've changed my mind.
I'd really like to know.
I'd like to know everything.
Excuse me.
I-i have to go call my folks.
But the thing I'm most thankful for? How even on the most giving of days, People can still do something unforgivable.
I really care about you.
I just don't know what to do.
Signed, sealed and delivered, I'm yours.

"letters to a young poet," first edition.
And the original herter norton translation to boot.
That's All thanks to you.
I found it at the rare book store you told me about last week.
I'm giving it to Aaron for Hanukah.
That's very nice.
It means he must've accepted your invitation to the snowflake ball.
Unfortunately, he will be unable to attend.
Oh.
Apparently, high society formals don't go with the whole Brooklyn artist thing.
Well, i it's an acquired taste, to be sure.
Um will you still be going? Absolutely.
There's something I love about the snowflake ball.
It reminds me of "Anna Karenina," only by Anna Wintour.
I'll just be flying solo.
That's my preferred method of social travel.
That's good.
Uh, we can we can hang out then.
Dan Humphrey, the scourge of high society, - is going to the ball? - I know.
I'm still reeling.
Uh, yeah, I just realized that some of the best memories in my past two years have, uh, have been at those events.
So I figured, why fight it? Well, look who's embracing change.
Uh, I'm assuming that Aaron will be okay with two dateless friends hanging out at the ball together? Yeah.
He he better be.
And he's friends with his ex, Lexi.
She's actually coming to town for the holidays.
I'm going to the gallery now to see his new installation.
Do you want to come? I just have to stop and change first.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
I got your message.
What's the emergency? Do you consider Muddy Watters blues or classic rock? I'm reorganizing my dad's record collection by genre.
Why? - Because I already bound all of Dan's short stories - and cleaned the loft twice.
Did you accidentally put red bull - in your cereal this morning? - No, I just need to keep myself busy.
Otherwise, I'm gonna start thinking about my future, and then there's gonna be a Jenny Humphrey-shaped hole - through my wall.
Okay, would you stop putting so much pressure on yourself? You're back home and you're still a great designer.
The future will work itself out.
It's just that's not all I'm thinking about.
What? - Okay, look, I don't I don't want to be awkward, but the one thing I can't figure out is what happened with Nate.
Is that totally pathetic, sitting around, - thinking about how some guy blew you off? - No.
But in my experience, it doesn't really help either.
I'd Move on.
Yeah.
Sorry.
I told Rufus that I'd be at the gallery all day.
So I'll see you later? Yeah.
I'll be here, literally probably in the same spot.
Oh, hello, weird documentary girl.
Good-bye, sad Blair Wannabe.
Penelope, what are you doing here? Snowflake ball I wanna commission a dress.
Your fashion show was impressive.
Thanks, but snowflake ball's tomorrow, And I kinda hate you, so I know, but this is about fashion, not friendship, J.
Hazeland is keep biting my style, and I need something custom.
I'm very expensive.
I hope so.
I think we'd better have a second snowflake machine.
I mean, it is called the snowflake ball.
We can't have drizzle.
Hey.
Hey.
I thought the decorating committee - agreed on poinsettias.
Oh, they did.
I didn't.
Uh, casablanca lilies.
Sneaky.
Hey, thanks for offering, um, to help out.
It's really been fun.
Well, when you just happened to mention my background in sound systems and lack of volunteer hours at the last P.
T.
A.
Meeting - I sort of got your signal.
Sorry.
I had to get out of the house, and I didn't want to be down here alone.
You and Bart still haven't talked.
I've pretty much hung up the, uh, - Marital "do not disturb" sign.
Well, you're gonna have to talk to him sooner or later.
Well, isn't that what new year's resolutions are for? Hmm.
Have you decided if you're going to, uh, make it to the dance or not? - Witness the fruit of your labors? - Jury's still out.
All right, well, if you do, save me a dance.
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.
We need to talk.
Fine.
Aw, they're adorable! You know, I feel inspired to shop at the GAP.
Or, um, validate my self-image with overpriced cosmetics.
Wait a minute.
You sure this one didn't just come with the frame? Women have been the focal point for artists throughout history, - and you know it.
Exactly.
Yeah, way to swing at a 2,000-year-old pitch.
And with blondie the bombshell, no less - Serena, Dan, hey.
This is Lexi.
The ex? I was wondering when I'd finally meet you.
So I I know I probably should've asked you sooner, But how would you feel about coming with me to the snowflake ball? Oh.
Uh I would love to, But I don't I don't think it's a very good idea right now.
Oh, you mean, you haven't told Jenny about us? Look, I know you guys are close, and I'm the last person who'd want to come between friends.
But believe me.
Jenny doesn't care.
I mean, she pretty much blew me off.
But whatwhat if she didn't? I mean, what if you found out that she still liked you? I mean Vanessa, I'm I'm really happy right now.
Let's just go with this.
Please.
Okay.
Okay.
But - What? What? - We're in "gossip girl" country, so rein in your horses.
Hmm.
You're probably right.
Huh? Okay.
So tell me.
Whatever happened between you and Nate? I'm sorry? Please.
Your kiss was all over "gossip girl.
" And he was living here, wasn't he? Uh It uh, yeah, for a little bit.
Um Why do you care? Now that the Archibald name is on the social rebound, I was thinking of asking Nate to the ball.
So what's the story? Nothing.
Um, nothing even happened between us, so Well, I wouldn't beat yourself up about it.
I mean, you had to know it was doomed from the start.
He's upper east side, and you're, well here.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Sorry, ladies, for those of you who you are hoping to find Nate Archibald under your trip, looks like he has already picked up his own mistletoe mate.
I really don't appreciate you your showing up unannounced at a school function.
I'm sorry, but you haven't left me many options, - And we do need to talk.
Fine.
Talk.
It's, uh It's been a long time since I've been a husband, Lily.
And I just want you to know that I fired Andrew Tyler, That private investigator who gathered all those files.
No more snooping.
No more trying to control you and the kids.
It's done, and I'm sorry for everything.
Thank you, but, um, I don't think that that's enough.
Well, then tell me what is, and I'll do it.
I can change, Lily.
You know I can If you'll let me.
I should be back from my Miami trip in time to go to the ball.
So if you want to think about what I said and are willing to give me a second chance, I'd be honored to accompany you.
I, um, I have to go.
There's a few more things I have to do inside.
I know Lexi can be a bit much.
Blair Waldorf is my best friend.
I can handle "much," but that felt personal.
She doesn't mean anything by it.
She thinks she's protecting me.
Oh, great! Well, how long is the enforcer gonna be with us? Uh, she's staying with her folks through the holiday.
So is that christmas eve? Or are we talking new year's eve? Or or maybe boxing day? You have any kopi luwak back there? - Uh, kopi what wak? - It's a coffee made from berries That have been passed by the Asian palm civet.
It's a cat.
Oh.
I had it in indonesia.
It's delicious.
Well, our cat lives with our grandmother in Florida.
My sister has allergies.
That's a shame.
Yeah, uh, we do, however, have this bag here of nondescript beans whose berries have been passed through a massive corporate infrastructure, so You're funny.
Come on.
It would mean a lot to me if you gave her a chance.
Please? # Sexual riot # Okay.
Fine.
But as long as we're swapping favors here, It'd really make me feel much better about you spending all this time with her if you I don't know, escorted me to my senior winter dance? Fine.
You got yourself a deal.
So New plan for tonigt Dan here has agreed to give me a walking tour of Brooklyn - Yeah, last-minute - I and I thought it might be fun for the four of us to hang out, Get to know each other.
# Sexual riot # I mean, unless the two of you guys want to hang out alone.
# Sexual riot # # Sexual riot # No, no.
Sounds great, Lexi.
Anyone home? I have a gift certificate to Grimaldi's, And I'm thinking double pepperoni.
Everything okay? How could you? Really, Vanessa? Lying and seeing Nate behind my back? I'm So sorry.
I have been meaning to tell you.
I just wasn't sure how.
You knew this entire time why Nate wasn't calling, - And it was because he was with you! - I understand that you're upset.
But if I remember correctly, - you kissed Nate behind my back first.
And I felt so horrible about it That I ran after you, and you were gone.
So what happened to not letting a guy get in between us? - Are you really that desperate, Vanessa? - Are you that jealous, Jenny? - Oh, my god! - I'm sorry you found out this way.
I am.
But since you have, you might as well know that Nate asked me to the ball tomorrow night, and I think I'm gonna go.
What do you want, Bass? - It occurred to me today when I was having my afternoon shiatsu - that I should choose your date.
You? Why? Why not? And it'll let me prove I know you better than anyone else.
Fine.
Then I choose yours.
I bring a date for you, you bring one for me.
Let's see who's paying attention to the other's desires.
There has to be something to keep you honest and make things interesting.
Name the stakes.
If you actually like your date, I get your limo for a month.
Fine.
And if you like yours, I get Dorota.
What? Dorota? Yes, Ms Blair? Fine.
By the way, I take my breakfast in bed.
What are you staring at? Go polish something.
You know, I I write on these benches all the time.
And actually, Norman Mailer used to live in that townhouse right there.
You can't imagine how many times I thought about knocking on his door.
Why didn't you? - Uh, common courtesy? Okay.
It's a door, but Whatever.
No.
She's she's she's right.
I I don't know why I'm always so worried about what people might think of me.
It certainly hasn't paid off.
Wow! And here, I thought the "y" chromosome was incapable of change.
Look at you two branching out.
Aaron decided he would escort me to the snowflake ball tomorrow night.
Oh.
Wait, I'm sorry.
Pause.
Snowflake ball? - Yeah.
Yeah, it's this, uh, this, uh, school charity dance that Serena and I have.
And you're going as well? - Yeah.
And what? I'm here to test-drive the Norman Mailer anecdote for your actual date tomorrow night at the ball? No.
Uh, no.
I don't have a date, actually.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Uh, you know what? I just had the craziest idea.
Why don't the four of us go together? - That is, if you would be my date.
Well, it depends.
That little speech you just gave - Well, he doesn't live there anymore.
Not really the point, is it? - He he the man's dead.
Come now.
Ring doorbell.
You okay with her coming tomorrow? Well, yeah.
It's a little "when Harry met crazy.
" But as long as Dan's fine with it I'm guessing he'll end up being more than fine with it.
Meaning? Lexi likes to sleep with guys on the first date.
She claims it's a political statement Against male-dominated sexual hypocrisy or something.
Well, can't she just vote? In her defense, she she she dates very few guys.
But once there's one in her sights, that's pretty much it.
You still okay? Yeah.
Whatever.
Yeah, whatever.
Taking off? - Morning meeting in Miami.
I should be back tomorrow.
Sure that's wise? Seems to me - the old marriage thermostat is headed south of late.
And whose fault is that? Thanksgiving was a disaster because of those files.
You think I don't know who had the combination to that safe? Every time I think we're making progress You show your true colors.
Hey.
Uh, your housekeeper let me in.
Good, then she can let you out.
What? - And tell your friend Vanessa it's not wise to fish in our pond.
Mm.
Well, she's not my friend.
Really? Because we were just trying to think of a way to send her a little message.
Feast your eyes, ladies.
Well what do you think? I think you shouldn't stand in front of the light in that dress.
Oh, my god! It's see-through! Well, that's one way to be the center of attention.
At least you don't have to worry about going home alone.
Oh, what do you guys think Vanessa's wearing to the ball? - She's going to the ball? Yeah, with Nate.
Jenny, Isabel's dress looks a little like one of yours, - don't you think? - No.
Not at all.
I know of a little something called "lining.
" Well, what if you didn't? Snowflake or snowfake, either way it's gonna be a ball Chuck is gonna in the shock of his life.
I have depths he'll never plumb, but I know every inch of his wafer-thin soul.
What do you think? You're right.
Louboutin peep toes, always.
Hey, just so you know, seeing someone with your ex, - even if you think you're ready Not easy.
I assume you're talking about your lame outer-boroughs double date last night.
What happened? - Uh, nothing.
It was great Right up until Dan asked Lexi to go with him to the snowflake ball.
So they're going to the dance? - Yeah, and then I found out she tends to extend herself to guys on a first date.
So? - So?! We're we're friends.
So shouldn't I, like, give him a heads-up or something? - Oh, absolutely.
Guys hate to be caught off guard with s*x on the first date.
You're right.
You're right.
I should just not think about it.
Exactly, just like I'm sure Dan doesn't think about you and Aaron all horizontal and sweaty.
Wait, you guys have slept together, haven't you? Why not?! He's hot, and you actually like him.
How often do you find that in the same guy? Which is why I haven't rushed into anything.
You wanna wait? Fine.
But in the meantime, Dan is going to be taking a ride on the Lexi-coaster.
Think about it.
Jenny.
What are you doing here? - I'm still mad at you.
So what, you're gonna kill me and put me in the garment bag? I couldn't sleep last night.
I was up half the night making this before I realized who it was for.
You made that for me? Yeah.
I mean, um I said some pretty awful things because I was hurt.
So I guess just consider this a peace offering.
You'll look great.
I, uh I don't I don't know what to say.
Just say you'll try it on.
Okay.
I thought I made it clear that we need to find Chuck the perfect date.
Kristin Curran is the loosest girl in our class.
Don't you know - that Chuck doesn't like his fruit pre-picked? - She has long hair.
in Poland, long hair symbolizes - And Elizabeth Phillips is somewhere between mormon and moron! - How did you come up with these? - Facebook.
I joined few groups.
This has to be Chuck's dream girl intelligent but not a bookworm, strong-willed but still feminine.
An equal.
And he likes brunettes with deep brown eyes.
But, Miss Blair, that's you - No, that girl is out there, and you better hope for your sake that I find her! Please.
I don't want to shine Mr.
Chuck's shoes for a month.
Yeah, his shoes if you're lucky.
What? Nothing.
Now get back to work.
Ticktock, ticktock.
Hello? - You know, when you rent a tux in Brooklyn, They throw in the shoes.
No, I I didn't know that.
Um, what's going on? Uh, well, this is probably stupid, but I just wanted to make sure that this was all okay with you.
You know, uh, you, me, Lexi and Aaron.
Yeah, of of course.
Why wouldn't it be? Well, I don't know.
Dramatic precedent? Well, I think we've outgrown that.
Good.
Good.
Me, too.
Uh, you know, I have to say, I'm really looking forward to this tonight.
Oh, okay.
Great.
Um, I will I'll just talk to you later then.
Yeah, I I'll see you.
Yeah.
So I I so appreciate you coming tonight.
I know.
You've thanked me a dozen times.
I know.
I know, but, um I wanna thank you Properly.
Later tonight.
Really? Hmm.
There.
It's beautiful.
Mm.
Um, Jenny, about the whole - handbag.
Here.
I'm gonna get going.
Wait.
I have to tell you something.
When I flipped out on you yesterday and asked if you were jealous, it's because I always have been a little of you and Dan.
And to me, growing up, you guys had it all.
And it doesn't excuse what I'm about to tell you, but Um It's cool.
You don't you don't have to tell me.
I don't want to know.
And No, it's fine.
Um, have fun tonight, though, okay? Bye.
Hey.
I'm glad you called.
There's something I have to talk to you about.
No, I, um, I'd rather do it tonight in person, actually.
Hello, Mrs.
Landingham.
Could you tell Bart that I'm waiting for him to go to the snowflake ball? Well a meeting? Well, who's it with? Andrew Tyler? Let me call you back.
Hi.
Uh, it's me.
Could you inform Mr.
Bass that my plans have changed? I won't be waiting, and he shouldn't come to the ball.
We all set? Jenny called after she delivered the dress.
Brooklyn Betty walks in, we cue the song Hazel's new boyfriend hits her with the spotlight.
I hate you all.
And we expose her in nothing but her cheap glass slippers.
Nate Save me a dance? Oh.
Uh, yeah.
Sure.
# The crowd's getting thinner, we are getting closer # - Are you Chuck Bass? - Are you Blair's girl? Not bad.
You know, the roof has a spectacular view of the city.
Oh.
Excuse me.
He's taken.
Shoo.
You look lovely.
Not as lovely as I'll look in my limo.
Where's my prince uncharming? Sandbox rules.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
Fine.
Here she comes.
Justine, this is Chuck Bass.
Very nice to meet you.
You can't be serious.
I need to talk to you.
Excuse us.
# But later I'm crying # # I'm sick and stronger, I'm always getting weaker # Looks like tonight's the night.
What, uh, what are you what are you talking about? Well, Aaron likes to play things a little close to the vest.
Took a little arm-twisting, but I finally found out that Serena gave him the green light for tonight.
Oh, you mean they they haven't had s*x? You're not as quick on the uptake as you pretend to be, Humphrey.
Do you care? I don't.
I don't.
We both know that I'm your one and only, and a Canal Street knockoff seemed like the best option.
My thinking exactly.
Fine.
You know, if beta-bass is anything like the original, I've no doubt that sooner or later, he'll disappointment me.
And I'm curious to see if the new Blair has all the features I so enjoyed on the old model.
So the bet is still on? - Unless you're prepared to concede? To you? Never.
Um Hi, Rufus.
Wow.
# I saw you you saw me# Where's Bart? # That's when I needed you # I'm leaving him.
I'm doing it for me.
I don't expect anything.
# I kissed you # Except maybe a dance.
# We'd always be # # Well, I like you # # You like me # # Seems that we fit # # So perfectly # # You made me # # Feel worthy # # And I've let you # # Take care of me # # Oh, oh # # We're all right now # # Gonna break down the breakdown # # Move from where we stand # Uh, so you and Aaron seem like you're having a good time.
So do you guys.
What? Uh, no, uh, lexi told me about your your and Aaron's plan tonight, that's all.
Oh.
I am gonna miss her when she's gone.
No, I only mention it because we're, you know, we're friends now.
So, uh, is there anything you wanna talk about? - Well, what's there to talk about? We've we've been dating for a while.
We've gotten to know each other.
It's not like we're rushing into anything.
Right.
And that's, uh, that's, you know, that's important.
Well, it is to some people.
I know Lexi has a more "come hither" attitude about s*x.
Right.
Wait, what? Well, she's planning on seducing you tonight.
Seduce seducing me? I Wow.
What does "wow" mean? Well, I I always assumed that I would, uh you know, again sooner or later.
Maybe "assumed" is a strong word, "hoped" is probably more accurate.
# You need me # What? # But I need to # # feel strong # Mm.
Nothing.
I just you and Lexi together I I just thought s*x was meaningful to you, that's all? Well, it is, and especially when I haven't had it in a long time.
Right.
Okay, then.
Have fun.
Well, Serena, I I was kidding.
There you are.
I'm parched.
Drinks? Sure.
Jenny? What are you doing here? Hi.
Uh It it doesn't matter.
Um I'm ending things with Nate.
What? I never meant to hurt you.
Please believe that.
Where is she? How long does that subway thingy take? - Maybe she's not coming.
Or little Jenny had second thoughts.
Vanessa! Finally.
Showtime.
Hey.
Wow, you look gorgeous.
Thank you.
I need to tell you something, and while I do, I need for you not to say anything.
Okay.
I've, um I've never felt this way about anyone before.
Never.
And it made me do something that I can't believe I did.
Jenny never got your letter.
That's why you never heard from her again.
I took it before she saw it.
And I'm sorry.
Vanessa! Poor Vanessa.
Even Cinderella was given the courtesy of a stealth getaway.
Then again, what's a trail of ugly stepsisters compared to Jenny Humphrey? Vanessa, here.
Take this.
Vanessa, wait.
Please! Looks like it might turn out to be an unhappily ever after for everyone.
Jenny, did you do that to Vanessa? Yeah.
You don't understand, though.
Oh, she completely She what? She lied? She went behind your back? So what? For that she deserved to be publicly humiliated? She's your friend, Jenny.
You know, there's no reason for me to tell you this now, but I wrote you this letter after the fashion show, telling you I had feelings for you.
I never got that.
No, I know.
Vanessa stole it.
But she felt so bad about it, she came and told me the truth.
Okay, look, I I know what you must think of me right now.
But if I'd if I'd gotten that - Well,I'm glad you didn't.
Honestly, you're not who I thought you were.
Where are they? Relax.
They'll be here somewhere.
This is the worst out-of-body experience ever.
Hey! Explain this! After you and Chuck walked off, Justine and I got to talking.
He took me up to the roof, and we looked over the city.
Well, of course he did.
We just knew we were meant for each other.
But she's me, only less.
I gave her that headband.
We're as surprised as you are.
Everyone, even our doppelgangers, can work it out, but we can't? I hate that I have to hurt him.
I know it sounds strange, but I suddenly feel horrible about what I have to do.
I'd be worried about you if you didn't.
And the kids.
Oh, Eric has become so accustomed to him.
Eric wants you to be happy.
I never thought my life would turn out like this.
I've always tried to do the right thing.
It's all you can do.
Just, uh Smile and fake it.
Tell me something, Rufus.
What? Something you shouldn't.
I never wanted to weigh in about your relationship with Bart.
I was afraid of what I might say.
Which was? I let you go on your wedding day because I was afraid I couldn't give you what you needed.
I wasn't sure what I needed.
And I have regretted it every day since.
As much as I appreciate company from the airport, I thought I made myself clear.
Your services are no longer required.
Trust me, you gave me a final assignment, and you do wanna know what I found out.
This isn't a good time, Chuck.
She's here.
What are you talking about? - Lily's at the ball with Rufus Humphrey.
And from what I'm seeing, You should figure something out and get down here now.
What do you have? Charles.
You've been good for him, good for us.
I always liked you, Regardless of how I may have acted.
He's on his way here.
You owe him a conversation.
Vanessa! Wait.
You stole my letter.
I know.
Is there anything else you wanna tell me? Pretty sure that was it.
You said you never felt this way about anyone before.
Is that true? Does it matter? Okay, listen, after all we've been through When you walked away tonight, all I could think was, "she's the one I want to be with.
" So, yeah, it matters.
It's easy for you to say because you didn't just pull a Janet Jackson at the snowflake ball.
Oh.
You wanna grab a drink? Yes, I would.
Somewhere dark with no backlighting.
Well, maybe a little backlighting.
Mm, let's go.
Okay.
Don't think we didn't see you try and save her.
We should've known you didn't have what it takes.
You never did.
You know, I don't know what's more pathetic That I wanted to be one of you, or that I was - actually scared of you.
Either way, that leaves you with pathetic, you and your friend.
Uh, oh, Vanessa? Vanessa is ten times the person you will ever be.
That is why you hate her so much.
It's kinda easy for you to talk big when you're hiding out in Brooklyn.
Well, maybe we should change that.
I'll see you guys around.
# Hey, hero, what you do? # # Again and again # # Goes either way # # Goes either way # # Without you # Dance with me.
What's the point, Chuck? We're never gonna be them.
You said so.
Remember? It's not for us.
Maybe.
But I wouldn't change us, Not if it meant losing what we have.
And what do we have, Chuck? You tell me.
Tonight.
So shut up and dance with me.
# Goes either way # # Goes either way # # Without you # Hello? Yes, this is Lily Bass.
Think maybe we should wait for, uh, Aaron and Serena? - I don't know.
I thought it might be fun for the two of us to hang out - Alone.
Right.
Right, alone.
Y you know what? We came with them, so I just I wouldn't want to be rude.
I mean, uh I don't know.
Are you hungry? - 'Cause I know a great place we could go - Dan.
Hey.
Hey, guys.
What's up? Do do you mind if I talk to Dan for a second? No.
No, I don't.
I'm gonna I'll grab us a cab.
I'll get one for us, too.
Mm.
I just want to apologize for how I acted earlier.
I, um I had no right.
No, no apology necessary.
Good.
I I dIdn't want you to go off tonight And, uh, do whatever it is you're gonna do, Um, without me just Clearing the air first.
Well, uh, well, consider it cleared.
And by the way, - I didn't mean to pry earlier about all that stuff.
No, I know.
Well, uh Good, I good.
We can both Go with clean air.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
It was meaningful with you.
It it it was the greatest night of my life.
Mine, too.
W-why why does it feel like we're cutting some mythological tie? I don't I don't know, but it but it does.
Are we - Serena, where's Charles? - I I don't know.
I need to find him.
Mom, what's wrong? Bart's been in an accident.
Here--your one and only source Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
I fired andrew tyler, that private investigator Thank you, but I don't think that that's enough.
Where's bart? I'm leaving him.
I'm doing it for me.
I don't expect anything Lily's at the ball with rufus humphrey.
You should figure something out and Down get here now.
I wouldn't change us Not if it meant losing what we have.
And what do we have, chuck? You tell me.
It was meaningful with you.
It--it was the greatest night of my life.
Mine, too.
Serena, where's charles? Mom, what's wrong? Bart's been in an accident.
X.
O.

O.
, gossip girl.
More towers than trump, More bucks than bloomberg Bart bass definitely made his mark on manhattan.
The passing of a public figure can shake a whole town, But the real story is always the one happening in private, Away from the headlines, At home.
Ah.
Come.
Eat.
You need your strength.
I'm not hungry.
I'm saving room for later.
In times of great uncertainty, it's even more important That we continue our daily rituals.
You haven't eaten a cheerio since you've been here.
And we--we know that's gin in your coffee cup.
My point exactly.
Life must go on as it always has.
Come on.
How's mom? I took her some coffee and some toast.
She didn't sleep very much last night.
Or any night since it happened.
All she does is make lists and yell at people.
People mourn in their own ways.
What happens tonight when it's all over And there's nothing left for her to do? Maybe she'll move into the palace And hole up with chuck.
Ah, yes, the bottomless minibar And the comfort of the twins in room service.
It's scandal.
People mourn in their own ways, mother.
I've been assured by the hotel That if chuck isn't alive and well Well At least he's alive.
Oh.
That's a nice picture.
Remind me to send a thank-you note to the photo editor.
Is that tuna? Grandma, please talk to her.
W-we're--we're doing comfort food.
Nobody's comforted by a tuna tower.
Fine.
Darling, where are you going? Oh, out, uh, for a walk to the park.
Well, is that wise? Well, it's really hot in here with the cooking And the Cooking.
I'll--i'll be-- I'll be right back.
Oh, that's a good picture.
Lily should send a thank-you note to the photo editor.
How is, uh, charles holding up? Who knows? He hasn't returned any of my calls or texts.
But the hotel says they keep sending up food, So there's something alive in that room.
Oh, you should try some capers with tha And just a tickle of the sliced onion.
Maybe I'm underestimating his emotional bond With kim and kristi from room service, But I just think that at a time like this, He should be with someone who cares about him.
Not enough.
Not enough.
That is exactly why we are getting married, So that we can always be around to care for each other.
That's true.
It is.
Just delivered, ma'am, for your trip to paris.
Christmas in paris.
How can you even think of your vacation The day that we're putting bart in the ground? Because, my dear, in the midst of death, we are in life.
Genius.
Maybe nate's heard from chuck.
Hey.
Hey.
I wasn't expecting to see you.
I know.
I was just coming to check in on you, See how you were.
I'm fine.
I'm just worried about my mom and eric And chuck.
That's, uh, that's nice.
I'm worried about you.
Thank you so much for being such a rock These past few days.
It's meant so much having you around, Yeah, well, it's not a problem.
It just--it feels natural.
It does, doesn't it? Hey, serena.
Aaron, hey.
Dan.
Hey, aaron.
Uh, i-i just wanted to check in, see how you were.
Oh, yeah.
I'm--i was just telling dan.
I'm fine.
But it-it's good to see you a-and you.
But, um, I'm actually gonna go to the church With just my family, so I'll see you both there? Yeah, sure.
Sounds good.
Yeah.
That's great.
See you there.
Okay then.
Bye.
Bye.
I'm sorry we haven't spoken since the ball.
I really appreciate your messages.
All I want to say is that I'm here.
If you want me to keep my distance, I can do that, too.
I, um, can't imagine what you're going through.
Well, actually, you can better than anyone else can.
Everyone's so concerned about the grieving widow, But as much as I feel shock and loss, Mostly I feel guilt.
I'm sure you must be thinking a hundred thoughts right now, But, lily, you cannot blame yourself.
Why not? He was on his way to see me.
I was I was gonna end our marriage.
It's okay.
You hear me? Um, he left me a voice mail.
Oh.
What'd it say? I don't know.
I haven't listened to it.
I've been too afraid, you know, To hear his voice.
Well, do you want to listen to it right now.
I'll stay with you.
Thank you, but I'll do it myself.
I have to get back.
Lil, I'm waiting for you this time.
Six months, Six years, I'll be here.
My condolences.
Skip the sympathy.
This is business.
My father met with you right before he died.
I want to know what you told him that night.
I worked formr.
Bass, not you, And what I have--you're not the only party interested.
I'm about to become very rich.
Yeah, congrats.
But there's someone else who's about to come into some money, And I think she might be more motivated than you are.
Lily? That bitch is the reason my father is dead.
I'll be in touch.
You can buy me a drink.
I'm sorry.
I can't stay.
If you'll excuse me I have to go bury my father.
They say that when someone dies, Their secrets are buried with them, But on the upper east side, Sometimes the dead still speak.
You have one unheard message.
Lily, we need to talk, And not about how my wife is making a fool of me With her old lover.
I know the real reason you were in that hospital in france.
Message deleted.
Alomst there, see you soon That was serena.
She'll be here soon.
Yeah, I got that.
Well, I got it first.
Yeah, well, it's probably my service.
Yeah, that's probably it.
Hey, jen.
Hey.
I just talked to eric.
Uh, he said they're almost here.
That's old news.
Hey, eric.
Come here.
I'm gonna go pay my respects to your mom.
Thank you.
She'll really appreciate that.
How you holding up? Holding.
Have you seen jonathan? No.
Why? Are you guys back together? No.
No, i Just thought he might want to be here.
Yeah, that'll be fine.
Thank you.
I see daniel and his sister are here.
Will their father be making an appearance today as well? Ugh.
Why on earth would you ask that? I followed you to the park today.
Of course you did, mother.
We'll talk later.
Where is charles? We should have just driven him to the door And dropped him off on the steps.
No one should see him like this.
He needs to walk it off Okay, walk, chuck.
Bend knee, lift foot.
Maybe we should have just left him at the palace.
It's his father's funeral.
He needs to be here.
It shows respect.
Respect? My father wasn't showing much of that in his final days.
What's he talking about? Who knows? When we found him, His shoes were on the wrong feet.
Chuck, remember how in the eighth grade, You used to help yourself to the decanter In the captain's library? Where I first got my taste for single malt.
That's right.
And you'd have to go home to a 4-course dinner Without passing out in your consomm I Didn't want my father to think less of me What does that matter now? Chuck, Am I gonna have to stick my finger down your throat Nate'll hold back your hair.
What? No, no.
Sorry, blair.
You had me and then you lost me.
Just straighten his tie.
Thank you, dan, for being here for serena And for our whole family.
Of course.
I-i can't imagine it any other way.
You are a true gentleman.
Your father raised you kids right.
Thank you.
Dear, they want to know about the wreaths, Whether we should Hey! What the hell are you doing here?! Excuse me? He's just upset and loaded.
What are you doing at my father's funeral? You think he'd want you here? Chuck, if this is about the article, You know I didn't write it.
Do you think I care about your failed attempt At investigative journalism? My father is dead because of your father.
What, chuck? Look, I'm sorry about this Chuck, dan has been helping us, unlike you.
Helping us? Do you have any idea what his family has done? Daniel, I think maybe it would be best if you left.
No, grandma.
That doesn't make sense.
It's not fair.
Chuck is bart's son.
He doesn't have to make sense today.
It's okay.
I-i understand.
You have no idea.
Dan, I want you here.
Serena, it's okay.
Let him go.
I know you're upset, But we all really need each other right now.
Don't touch me, whore.
Charles, please.
You need to be with your family.
My family? I don't have a family.
If the lord is our shepherd, It looks like one of his lambs has lost his way Or maybe make that a black sheep.
We bring nothing into the world and we leave nothing behind, But that doesn't mean we don't leave A big ole mess when we go.
You're back soon.
I wouldn't have thought bart bass Would be one to have a short funeral.
Chuck threw me out before it even started 'cause according to him, uh, my My father "killed" his father.
What? Why would he say that? Well, i-i-i don't know, dad.
I mean, do you--do you have any wild guesses, any thoughts? Who knows? The kid's dad just died.
He's upset.
Yeah, that's what-- that's what cece said.
Cece's in town? That's nice for lily, to have her mom here.
That's right.
I always forget that you guys know each other.
Did you, uh, did you think of going today? To the funeral? Nah.
Why not? I mean, you're one of lily's oldest friends.
No, I know.
It's just better this way.
So how's serena? Um, that, uh, That would be a question for her boyfriend aaron.
You two have been spending a lot of time together Since the accident.
So? So like it or not, death changes things.
It clarifies them.
It brings some people closer together, pushes others Further apart.
I just thought maybe-- no, we're just-- we're friends.
Oh, wow.
Good.
Good? W-why is that good? Or bad.
I don't know.
Do you want to be more than friends? No.
We broke up p twe, and it's over.
It's very much over.
You don't have to stay that long.
Just let people shake your hand, say hello, You're done.
You don't have to convince me Oh, good.
Well, I just thought that after what happened At the church, you might not want to be Here.
This is exactly where I want to be I have business to attend to.
Okay, that's fine, but let's just find you a quiet corner, Get some food in your stomach.
I'm not in the mood for food.
You're really sweet with him.
Me? Sweet? No.
No, you are.
I mean, worrying about him, offering him food.
It's downright maternal.
I'm not maternal.
I've just been spending too much time with cyrus, And I'm turning jewish.
Come on.
I see kugel.
I found that sermon surprisingly thought-provoking-- All that stuff about life and death And our time on earth being so fleeting.
Darling, it's a funeral.
What was he supposed to talk about, the stock market? Hmm? What's the best pizza in town? Although, that is quite good.
Mmm.
No, I know, but I want to get married.
I know.
So do i.
That's why we're engaged.
No, but I mean now.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow? We cannot get married tomorrow.
No, you can't.
Why not? Life is so short.
It's all uncertain.
I don't want to live another day without being your husband.
What do you say? She says that's crazy.
It is.
It's crazy.
Well, we'll do it at the apartment, Just the family.
Simple, elegant, fast.
Well, it is kind of romantic.
Mother.
I thought you were supportive of this union.
I am, as something that happens in a vague, far-off future That never really lands on me because I'll be away at college, Not as what I'm doing tomorrow at 7:00.
Candlelight.
That's perfect.
That's not what I was saying.
No.
I don't have anything to wear.
Well, uh, what if someone made you something? I mean, what'd you have in mind? How about you minding your own business? I was thinking something in a jacket, very y.
S.
L.
Okay, mick and bianca, 1971.
Great reference.
Yeah, I hate to interrupt this fascinating chapter In "favorite moments in fashion history," but-- jackets are tricky.
I know.
But, um, I also know someone who owes you An all-nighter, and she would be honored.
Well, I think you should tell her that I said.
.
Thank you.
Thank you for giving me a chance to make amends.
I'll call the rabbi.
Now where is-- where is aaron? I want to come to buenos aires with me for christmas.
What? That's a plane ticket.
With your name on it.
I-i don't want to say no, but i-i-i have to.
My family is a disaster.
My--my brother is lonely, And my mom is losing it And chuck has publicly disowned us.
Are you sure it's your family you don't want to leave, Or is there someone else? Dan? Is my friend, aaron.
You--you don't have to worry.
I-i'm not--i'm not worried.
This trip is my gift to you.
And you going with me will be your gift to me.
But I already bought you a book.
I'll read it on the plane.
Just think about it.
Okay.
Excuse me. May I please steal my daughter for a moment?
Mother, if you want to talk, now is not the time.
What does chuck know? Did you not hear what I just said? He knows something about you and rufus.
You should find out what.
Mother, I just came from burying my husband.
I do not have the time, inclination Or frankly, the mental capacity to go head-to-head with chuck.
And what he knew, he already told bart, So there's nothing to worry about, now is there? Let's hope not.
But you won't know until you talk to him.
I saw him head up the stairs.
Hello? Yeah, this is she.
No, I'm afraid that's impossible.
I'm rather busy right now, Which you would know if you read the papers.
I'll be right down.
Jonathan.
You came.
I hope that's okay.
More than.
Can we talk? I have some explaining to do.
If you're looking for bart's will, you don't have to worry.
I'm not.
But you should be.
I'm going to find your file.
Well, it's not here, so you can stop ransacking the place And look at me.
I can't look at you, lily.
You disgust me.
Charles.
Disrespecting your marriage, Betraying my father with rufus humphrey.
I did no such thing.
He was coming to fight for you.
Talk about dying for nothing.
The only reason he got in that car is because you called him.
If you could have just stayed out of it But you couldn't, could you? Because you're just like him.
You have to know everything, control everyone, trust no one-- Are you saying this is my fault? No, it's no one's fault.
Yes, it is.
It's your fault.
His blood is on your hands.
I'm so sorry.
As soon as that will is read And I get my money, You will never see me again.
Coat.
Where is he going? Chuck.
Gotta go.
Can't talk.
Go where? Everyone you know is Standing in this room.
I don't want to be here We want you here.
I just lost my stepfather.
I don't want to lose my brother, too.
When are you going to get it? We are not related.
Just let him go.
No! Oh, don't even try to cheer me up.
Oh, I won't.
Andrew tyler was just here.
Bart's p.
I.
? Don't tell me he was here to pay his respects.
No, he wanted me to pay him.
He knows about the hospital in france.
What? That's why bart was coming to see me The night of the accident.
Tyler told him.
Well, now he's going to tell the highest bidder.
You have to stop him.
Do i? I'm not sure.
You can't be serious.
Well, after all this time, Now you decide that the--the right thing to do Is to tell the truth? The truth is out.
That changes everything, doesn't it? No, it doesn't have to.
There could be no better time for a clean slate.
There could be no worse time, mother.
This is the last thing I want to come out.
Pay him.
Chuck! Stop! Don't go.
Or if you have to leave, let me come with you.
I appreciate your concern.
No, you don't.
You don't appreciate anything today.
But I don't care.
Whatever you're going through, I want to be there for you.
We talked about this.
You are not my girlfriend.
But I am me And you are you.
We're chuck and blair.
Blair and chuck.
The worst thing you've ever done, The darkest thought you've ever had I will stand by you through anything.
Why would you do that? Because I love you.
Well, that's too bad.
Spotted--chuck bass fleeing his father's funeral And blair waldorf shedding tears for the dearly departed.
You know, if you're about to apologize for chuck, It's--it's really all right.
I mean, he's upset, And there's bad blood.
It wouldn't be entirely true To say that I get it, But I'm fine not getting it.
That's really big of you But that's--that's not actually why I called.
Aaron invited me to buenos aires for the holidays.
O-okay.
W-- well, uh, I've never been, So I don't know how helpful I can be with travel tips.
I mean, I know that it's, uh, summer there, so pack a bikini.
Dan.
When we heard about bart's accident, We were in the middle of a conversation.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
About what it would mean If you--you sleeping with aaron and me sleeping with lexi? But that never happened, so So I mean, I guess now it will, right? At least for you.
Or Well, are--are you--are you asking me to ask you not to go? No.
Look, serena, if you want to go, go.
If you don't, then don't.
I-i-i can't tell you who to be with.
No, but you can tell me how you feel.
How do you feel about your boyfriend Who--who wants to take you to south america? Well, I mean, he's really great.
I like him a lot.
Well, that's your answer then.
You know what? This--this muffin is apricot, I think.
Yeah, it, uh, I wanted cranberry.
They gave me apricot.
I gotta go back.
Well What do you think? Mazel tov.
Blair, I know this is all happening awfully fast for you.
I just hope you know how happy I am Just to be with your mother, But to have you in my family I love you Very, very much.
I told chuck I love him.
Really? That's wonderful.
No, it's not.
It's horrible.
I thought that If I could finally say it, then Everything would change, But he is just as selfish and soulless as ever.
Only a masochist could ever love such a narcissist.
Help me.
You don't need help.
He just needs time.
Wait.
Not enough.
Don't worry.
It'll all be okay.
You'll see, dear.
Well, how did it go with tyler? Serena's at breakfast, and eric's out with jonathan.
We can talk.
It went very well.
Oh.
Thank you, mother.
This was the right thing.
I know it was.
If you say so.
But the closing of this chapter Leads us to the opening of the next one.
What are you going to do about The fact that you're in love with rufus humphrey? Well, I'm not sure I'm gonna do anything, At least not right away.
So you are in love with him? I was fishing.
Oh.
Well, you caught me.
Considering the circumstances, I have tried with all of my strength to fight it.
It is a curse I do not wish on my worst enemy.
But I love rufus.
So that's why chuck was so upset.
Serena.
Let me explain Don't bother.
You love rufus.
You always have.
And you married bart anyway, and now he's dead.
Well, i-i might have, Uh, fleshed out some of the more subtle nuances, But, yes, I suppose that's the gist of it.
So go ahead.
How could i? Bart's body's not even cold.
Whatever horrible things you're gonna say to me, Just go ahead and say them.
I should have seen this coming.
You once asked me-- Begged me-- not to be with rufus Because of you and dan.
Has rufus told you he wants to be with you? He has.
Well, this may sound strange coming from me, but If you want to be with him, you should.
Maybe it's your time now.
After all that you've been through, You should at least try.
And what about you and dan? I'm gonna try to make things work with aaron.
We're going to buenos aires for the holidays.
That is, if it's okay with my mom.
I think it's gre.
Hey.
Hey.
How was breakfast with serena? Uh, she's flying off to Buenos aires with aaron.
Uh, well, she hasn't actually decided yet, But he invited her, and she's not sure, so I think I tipped her in the direction of saying yes.
Why would you do that? Well, because she asked me not to.
And--and I realize now, Saying it out loud, it makes no sense, but i-i just-- I don't want to play some stupid game.
Why not? If you play the game, then aaron ends u Dancing the tango alone and serena would be with you.
Yeah.
Well, when you put it like that You still have feelings for her, right? Okay, so do you think you could put them into words And speak to her out loud? Yeah.
Yeah, if she doesn't leave first.
She's gonna be at eleanor's wedding.
You can carry the garment bag.
Hey.
Where you guys going? Oh, eleanor's.
And no, we can't stop to talk.
We're late.
You're going, too? Yeah, um, I gotta--i gotta carry the garment bag.
Hey.
Where are, um, jenny And dan spending christmas? With alison in hudson.
Come away with me.
Let's take that trip we didn't take last year, Figure things out.
I don't want to wait six years.
I don't want to wait at all.
Tonight? I'll make a reservation at that bed and breakfast in cornwall, And it'll be gray and freezing, But I don't care.
We're gonna be okay this time, lil I know we will.
Congratulations.
You're the high bidder.
The only bidder, actually.
Well, if lily didn't spend every dollar she has, Maybe it's not worth it.
I was dealing with her mother.
She said lily wanted to stop hiding her past, come clean.
Well Tell me what's the point In me paying to know something If she's going to tell everyone anyway? Maybe there is none.
But you're about to become The richest kid in new york.
If I were you, I'd want to make that decision myself.
It's a pleasure doing business with you.
Oh, it's beautiful.
And so are you.
You know what could make this moment even better? If I told you I was going with you to buenos aires? Well, I am.
I talked to my mom and everything.
Hi.
Um, is eleanor freaking? I have her jacket.
Is that jenny humphrey? Where are my clothes? Yeah, she's freaking.
Oh, dan, do you mind, um, waiting here for me? No, not at all.
Uh, I'm coming.
I carried the garment bag.
I'm gonna go check on my dad.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
Mm.
Serena.
Dan, why are you really here? I don't want you to go with him.
Well, you're too late.
I already told him I would.
Tell him you're not.
Dan, it's not our time.
So what? It's you and aaron's time? You guys have a time now It's not about aaron.
It's a-- it's about our parents.
What about our parents? They're in love.
They--they never stopped being in love.
Oh.
Well, that explains a lot.
I already asked my mom not to follow her heart once, And I just-- I'm not gonna do it again.
Even if I did, I don't think she'd go along with me this time.
So you're g--you're gonna give up on all of this, on us, For your mom? We've already tried it and failed twice.
Who knows if we'd work any better? Who knows if we wouldn't? Look, we've both changed.
Dan, we're We're connected.
We always will be, but I'm dating someone else now.
Serena, we need your fashion advice.
Hi, humphrey.
What are you doing here? He--he carried the garment bag.
I did.
Yeah.
All right.
Come on, s.
I-i should go.
We'll talk after the holidays.
I just can't believe You'd want this to become public knowledge.
What is that? Oh, it's exactly What you think it is.
But my mother-- lied to you And to mr.
Tyler.
Judging by the look on your face, I'm guessing it wasn't your idea to come clean.
Why on earth would she do this? I don't know.
But the next time you see her, I'd ask.
But until then, I'm more Than happy to further Her agenda.
Charles, um, I beg you Please don't turn away from the people that love you.
They're the only chance any of us has.
And your father never learned that.
I hope that you do.
Wedding vows of eleanor and cyrus.
I, cyrus, Take, you, eleanor, To be no other than yourself.
I give you my love.
I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine.
Ani l'dodi v'dodi li.
To the waldorf-roses! Congratulations! What do you think you're doing here? This can't be good.
Cece.
Rufus.
I'm actually on my way out, if you don't mind.
There's something you need to know.
Isn't there always when you're around? Throughout my whole life, The only thing I have ever wanted is My daughter's happiness.
Now the means to achieving this might shift with time, But my goal remains the same.
Uh, since this is about lily, She can be the one to tell me or not tell me.
I won't allow your meddling to come between us again.
I gave her a chance to tell you.
She didn't take it.
In fact, she asked me to pay a lot of money To make the problem go away.
But you didn't do that, did you? The real problem Is that she's in love with you.
Why is that a problem? Because so long as she holds on to this, The two of you don't have a chance in hell Of making it work.
I want her to have that chance.
Don't you? So I guess the first time we actually sleep together Will be on an airplane.
Most guys get candles and lingerie.
My girl's gonna be sporting earplugs and a neck pillow.
Hey, you're gonna be fighting me for that neck pillow When your chin is on your chest And there's drool all over your shirt.
How did you know that I drool? I-i think this is gonna be good-- This trip, us, all of it.
No regrets? None.
Much better.
Well, thank you for telling me That you're in love with lily bass again Or--or still or whatever it is.
It would have been really useful information to have Before I tried to stop serena From flying off to south america.
I will never be with lily.
I don't understand.
Serena just said-- Serena doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.
Are you okay? What--what--what's all this stuff and your note? What, are you going somewhere? Nope.
Just out.
You can answer that if you want.
No, i-i don't--i don't want to.
I'm--i'm here now with you.
I know you still have feelings for him.
No, I don't.
No, it's okay.
I just want you to give us time, give us a real shot, Because I think I might be falling in love with you.
Hey, it's serena.
Leave a message.
Just tell me one thing.
Was it a boy or a girl? We hear chuck bass is not the only one Who lost someone he loved this week Our deepest condolence, Ms.

Gossip Girl's here, your one and only source Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
Serena, where's charles? Mom, what's wrong? Bart's been in an accident.
My father's dead because of your father.
My father met with you right before he died.
I want to know what you told him that night.
It's no one's fault.
Yes, it is.
It's your fault.
His blood is on your hands.
I want you to come to buenos aires with Me.
I don't want to say no, but I have to My family is a disaster.
Are you sure it's your family you don't want to leave I don't want you to go with him.
Wellllyou're too late.
I already told him I would Tell him you're not.
It's not about aaron.
It's about our parents.
What about our parents? They're in love.
I already asked my mom Not to follow her heart once.
I'm not gonna do it again.
Come away with me Let's take that trip we didn't take last year, Figure things out.
There's something you need to know.
Just tell me one thing.
Was it or boy or a girl? I will stand by you through anything.
Why would you do that? Because I love you.
Well, that's too bad.
C  B  Gossip girl here, welcoming you to the new year, When manhattanites who flew south for the sun Return to their park avenue perches, Which means I have a lot of catching up to do.
Word is serena van der woodsen tangoed in the new year In the plazas of buenos aires.
I guess that means lonely boy was all alone When the clock tolled 12:00.
And what of little j.
? There it is.
Thank god.
Rumor is she's given up couture for tartan.
All right, go learn something.
Has she also renounced her rebellious ways? So what did your dad say when you told him You wanted to go back to constance? Ha.
Well, it wasn't so much words as a whoop.
No he actually called headmistress queller At home at night on christmasve.
.
Wow.
So you know, I still don't Understand your sudden flip.
I don't know.
I.
.
I guess it was the snowflake ball.
I just felt 15 again For a second, and it felt kind of good.
I don't know.
Blair waldorf has been spotted Making inroads at the colony club.
With high school nearing its end, Has queen b.
Found a new social ladder to climb? So there's still no word from chuck? M.
I.
A.
Since the day after the funeral.
Uncle jack went to go look for him.
Wait.
Since when do you have an uncle jack It's bart's younger brother.
He does something for bass industries in australia.
He landed and kind of took charge.
Somebody had to.
So the only real question remaining Is where in the world is chuck bass? And is he ever coming back? Mm.
Dad, hey.
I was just e-mailing vanessa.
Here.
Let me take that.
Is she still up with her parents? Yeah.
Yeah, you know, I didn't expect you bac Until this afternoon.
The search for my sculptor hit a dead end.
Sc--wait.
Thought it was a painter.
Sculptor, painter Uh, he's sort of into mixed media.
Or she.
Still not sure about that.
I can't believe you didn't find him or her.
Hey, it's good to see you.
Hey.
Where's your sister? Oh, she left for school already.
Mm.
Yeah, sigh of relief all around.
In fact, I should get going myself.
Why don't I go with you? Well, because I'm not a third grader anymore.
Come on.
We can catch up.
Today's the first day of your last semester.
Allow me a trip down nostalgia lane.
All right, that's fine.
But no hugs.
Of course, the colony club is The oldest, most prestigious ladies' club in the city.
I'm honored just to be considered.
Oh, miss blair, they must take you as member.
They must do nothing, dorota.
It's the colony club, the most exclusive club in new york, Which means the world.
Now when the selection committee comes over tomorrow, Things have to be perfect.
It's my first step to building the kind of life I want-- One without Mr.
Chuck? It's a new year, dorota-- Time to focus on a new, unencumbered future.
Jack Bass Then again To deny one's past is to deny one's self.
We'll discuss the party on our way.
So you really haven't thought about it? Jenny.
Yeah? I asked if you were nervous about penelope And the mean girls.
Please, eric.
Really, in the past four months, I have faced down eleanor waldorf, I've hijacked a society gala, I had my entire collection Torched by a crazy model and was basically homeless, So I can handle high school.
Okay, I'm a little nervous.
Jenny, you're really here.
I was so happy when I heard you were coming back.
Wow.
Um, thanks, nelly.
That's really nice.
Nelly? I think you need your prescription checked.
Do you realize who you're talking to? And I don't see you holding My double tall no foam dry cap with two splendas.
We'll have to punish her.
Is that always how they treat you? Why would you put up with that? She's been gone a-a while.
If I even dreamed of defecting, Penelope and the others would make my life hell Or more hell.
I-i better go.
I'm glad you're back.
Thanks.
So nelly yuki is The new old jenny humphrey Hey.
Uh, you can't get involved.
I know.
It's I know.
Blair.
You came to greet us.
No you, jack.
Chuck.
You said you found him.
In bangkok.
He was staying at our hotel there.
I mean, you hear the term "den of iniquity," But until you really see it-- do you have him or not? Nephew mine? >on est arrive.
Tell his teachers he'll be taking a personal day.
Why are you following me? Go home and get ready for my party.
Yes, miss blair.
You got me here safe and sound, so Yeah.
Uh, l-let's, uh, make a plan for tonight I missed you on christmas and new year's.
Hold on.
Rufus humphrey.
Mr.
Humphrey, this is beth From child services in dorchester.
Yeah.
Thanks for calling me back.
Uh, in response to your query, Unfortunately, we don't have any record of such an adoption.
I spent the last two weeks striking out At every adoption agency in boston, So I'm not exactly surprised.
You know, Most likely, this was a private adoption Your only avenue is to check with the mother, The one who gave up the child? Yeah, I know.
I-i was actually about to do that Um, I guess I was just hoping there was another way.
Hey.
You're back.
Yeah.
Just.
I literally drove here from the airport.
Well, you look tan.
Well, it is summer in buenos aires.
That's right.
Southern hemisphere, Beauty of a round globe-- I broke up with aaron.
When? How about three hours afr we left new york? Which was maybe not the brightest idea On a 15-hour flight.
When I landed, I got an e-mail from my mom Saying that she and your dad weren't gonna be together, Now or ever.
I know.
I tried calling you before you left.
If you knew, you--i-i mean, you know, you could have Called or--or e-mailed.
Of course, unless you didn't want to.
No.
I needed to make sure That when the dust settled, we still felt the same.
And do you? Yes.
Do you? Spotted--s.
And lonely boy Kicking off the new year like it's last year.
Who knows, maybe 3rd.
Time's a charm I wouldn't crack open the bubbly just yet.
B.
! Oh! I missed you so much.
Not as much as I missed you.
Mm.
Hey, did, uh, jack ever find chuck? Yeah, what was left of him.
I'm surprised they made it through customs.
Chuck's body odor could have given a contact high To half of manhattan.
Oh.
S.
, I have to tell you something.
I did something so stupid.
B.
, what is it? I told chuck I loved him.
Oh, my gosh.
That's great.
Great? No, it's awful.
Not only did he not say it back, But he disappeared for a month.
If I could just go back And strangle myself as the words come Out.
No, I'm sure chuck will say it back He was probably thinking about you the whole time he was gone.
Not unless I was a thai hooker named bo.
And there's something else.
Hey.
Oh.
Hey.
This is my news.
When I was in buenos aires-- A postcard would have been fine.
I'm really happy for you.
I'm gonna go vomit now.
Happy new year.
She just needs time.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, listen.
I have an idea.
Uh, your last class today-- is is--is it, By any chance, incredibly "unmissably" fascinating? Why? Do you have something in mind? Mm-hmm.
Hello, rufus.
Lily.
How was your-- I want to know where my child is.
We already talked about that.
Do you realize I had to say, "my child" Because I still don't know if it's a boy or girl? I shouldn't have come.
I just spe the last two weeks Knocking on the door of every adoption agency in boston, Hoping to avoid this conversation.
But they all told me I had to ask the mother, so I'm asking.
I told you before christmas.
When I gave him up-- So it's a boy.
That's something, I guess.
I also gave up the right to go looking for him And I'm not gonna allow you to bulldoze into his life.
It's not fair.
How is that fair to me? When was I asked if I was okay with it? 'cause it's just you not wanting anyone to find out.
Oh, no.
I've given up on that.
Charles already knows, Although I actually believe he won't Say anything.
I have a right to know my son And he has the right to his own life, Just like you've had yours.
I was gonna be a rock star, remember? Instead I had two kids, and I was there to take them To school every morning and talk about their days at night.
And if someone came to me and said I could trade that For the life I wanted when I was 19, I wouldn't.
Being a father's who I am.
Don't take that away.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
Then I'll find him without your help.
They treat her like their servant.
And it is none of your business.
It's a new year, remember? New leaf, new jenny humphrey.
Um, nelly? Okay, no.
That's not okay.
And here we go.
Hi.
Penelope, can I talk to you for a second? So I don't mean to intrude on your authority or whatever, But Could you maybe be a little nicer to nelly? Sure.
Why not? Really? We're not monsters, j.
Nelly's our friend.
Oh, look at that.
Nelly, can you help me As a friend? Oh, not with a napkin.
It smudges.
Use your finger.
Okay, no.
That's enough.
Nelly, let's go.
Do you know what you're doing, little j.
? I'm not little j.
Anymore.
Thank you so much.
Just keep walking.
Hazel? Clean my shoe.
You want to get kicked out? Hello to you, too, lover.
Long time no see.
Put that out.
You didn't say the magic word.
What are you even doing here? You should be passed out or hooked up to an i.
V.
I didn't want to miss the first day of school Though it looks like I already did.
That's the only reason you came here? Not because you had something to tell me? Like what? You know like what.
Look at me.
Who are you? Chuck bass.
Please tell me that's not what I think it is.
Hey, dad.
Um, you know, serena was She was We're busted.
, mr.
Humphrey.
Happy new year.
Serena.
So you two are back together? Yeah.
Right? I mean, we--yeah, we are.
We're back together.
I think serena should be getting home.
What? Uh No.
I don't like the two of you being here alone when I'm not.
Are you-- are you kidding? Dan, this is my home.
I-i would appreciate if you respect that.
Yeah, i-i should go.
Um, it's a school night, And I haven't seen my mom yet, so Okay, yeah.
I'll--i'll get you a cab.
Good night, mr.
Humphrey.
I'm telling you This is a mistake.
Miss waldorf, this is not normal.
Headmistress queller, Charles is in no state to represent himself, And as mrs.
Bass is-- Van der woodsen.
My father is dead.
Is indisposed with grief.
Someone has to be here, so I am.
Sorry I'm late.
Jack bass, chuck's uncle.
How are you? Uncle jack.
What a surprise.
How have you been? Uh-huh.
So you don't remember our rickshaw ride Down selon road? The 15-hour flight? That was you? That was me.
Thank you, jack, but I've got this covered.
I figured, principal's office, A boys needs a parent or a guardian.
Parents being dead--sorry, chuck--i'm the closest thing, So what seems to be the problem? I found charles smoking marijuana on school property It was hash, actually.
I find it gives a softer high.
Right.
The evidence seems questionable.
Would you stop? I think we can all agree That charles has been through an ordeal.
He's clearly out of his right mind And can't be held responsible for his actions.
It's temporary insanity.
Headmistress, No court of law could find him guilty of a crime.
How can we? Mr.
Bass has been through a lot.
Do you promise me That nothing like this will ever happen again? Pop quiz--what do you get when you cross chuck bass, A billion dollars and bart cold in the ground? For you, headmistress Anything.
Free fall Everyone It has been a pleasure.
So what kind of suspension are we looking at? Hey, dan.
Morning, jen.
Okay.
What's with the cold front? Nothing.
Eat your breakfast.
Dad doesn't want me dating serena.
Wait.
What? You guys are back together? How did I not ow this? I'd rather we didn't discuss this right now.
Dad, serena's, like, the best thing That's ever happened to dan.
I mean, she's smart, She's funny, and she's, like, Nine levels hotter than him.
Thank you.
But she's right Come on.
Get onboard.
Dan, serena.
Dan, serena.
Whoo! Okay.
Dad is not into cheering.
Am I really supposed to pretend like this has nothing to do With what happened between you and lily before Christmas? Wait.
What happened with him and lily What happened between you and lily? It's none of your business.
Oh, so you can tell me not to date serena, But I can't say anything about you and Lily? Him and lily what? Somebody, please I think you need to leave for school.
Oh, you're not gonna walk me today? I'm heartbroken.
Okay, dad.
Seriously? You're gonna be late.
No, I'm not.
Yes, I am.
Dan, wait up.
Nelly has put in a full year of loyal service.
She should be allowed to leave without reprisals.
For example, people breaking into her locker And smashing her glasses.
I see.
Rebuttal? First, there has been a long tradition Of newer members being subjected to more Attention, Some of the things I had to do? Disgusting.
Oh, I remember.
I made you do them.
But more importantly, once people find out you can quit, The girls at the steps will be finished.
Come on, blair.
What's your decision?
Tonight I'm hosting the selection committee Of the colony club.
You're getting into the colony club? They never take girls from high school.
I know.
I was surprised, too.
That's not entirely true.
The point is, enough of this high school nonsense.
Nelly or no nelly, who cares? I have enough going on already.
God! Blair's leaving us behind.
It's like the end of an era.
We're more than any one member, And the only way nelly is leaving is in a body bag.
God, p., tone down the crazy.
When I left for argentina, my mom acted like she and your dad Were riding off into the sunset together, Then three hours later, he tells you it's over.
We were so happy for ourselves.
We--we never asked what happened between them.
And so--so what do we do? I don't know, but we have to do something, dan.
I need to talk to you.
Yeah, I'm-- I'll see you later.
Have you seen chuck today? No.
Why? Did he come home last night? No, blair, I don't know.
What's wrong? Yesterday queller caught him smoking hash at school.
There was a meeting, And to say it went badly would be an understatentnt.
I'm worried.
Blair, it's chuck.
He's somewhere blowing off steam.
It's what he does.
He'll show up in a couple days Minus a few million brain cells and some liver tissue.
That's true.
He always disappeared.
Marrakech, prague.
And he always came back, Tie perfectly knotted.
But this time, When I looked in his eyes I couldn't see him anymore.
You're really worried.
Okay, um, okay.
Uh, just give it till tonight, And if he hasn't shown up, we'll help you.
I gotta get to class.
I'm sorry.
Dorota, is everything ready for the colony ladies? No, not yet.
I have somewhere to go first.
Ow.
Watch it! Sorry.
Oh, my god.
They've got our table.
Here they come.
Just let me do the talking.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Yeah, try not to do that.
Isabel's gonna count to three.
If you've not vanished by then, I will not be responsible.
One Actually, I'd grab a table.
They're filling up pretty fast.
Sit anywhere, guys.
The tables belong to everyone.
Two? You're gonna pay for this, jenny humphrey.
I promise.
You will pay.
So should I keep counting? Oh, shut up, is.
Daddy? I need you to call headmistress queller.
There's a girl bullying me.
Hello, chuck.
I thought I'd find you here.
Blair.
Ladies, could you give us a moment? I thought you sold this place.
I bought it back last night.
Owner took me to the cleaners, But some things are worth the price.
You should go home.
Lily, serena, eric-- That is not my home or my family.
Fine.
Go to the palace.
Just get out of here.
Well, that would be rude Since I'm throwing a party here tonight.
I just posted it on "gossip girl.
" Maybe you'll grace us wi a aanan.
Chuck, stop.
All this doesn't help.
It isn't you.
Wrong.
Bart may have been a b*st*rd, But he saw me better than anyone.
I'm simply living up to my potential.
It's time to let go of your fantasies.
I don't believe you.
That's your business.
Now is that it, Or were you going to tell me you love me again? Why did you even come back? Dad? Dad? So what are we looking for again? Uh, notes, messages, anything that seems tied to my mom.
I don't--i don't see why I had to come.
He doesn't want me here.
I figure he's less likely to murder me with witnesses.
Yes.
That makes sense.
Oh, my god.
He asked my mom to marry him, and she said no.
That's why he's angry.
Yeah, that's my mom's ring.
She gave it back to him before christmas.
It was a-- it was a good theory, though.
Oh.
Blair It's blair.
She--she needs me.
I have to go.
Call me if you find something.
And what if he tries to kill me? South boston adoption agency.
New year, schmoo year.
Nothing ever changes.
The darkest secrets Are the ones buried closest to home.
Hello? Miss blair, where have you been? The colony club ladies will be here.
I just need ten minutes.
What happened? Penelope and the girls Got their parents to call queller.
They say I'm bullying them.
Wow.
Oh, my god, i--th-that is kind of genius.
She wants me to try to handle it by myself, Which basically means, roll over and take it.
I don't even understand.
Why won't penelope just let you quit? She's probably afraid I'll tell people she's sleeping with her dad's junior partner.
I mean, the things I know No.
Penelope would kill me Literally.
Yeah.
We'll see.
How much do you know? Dan, if you're here to argue-- what were you looking for in boston? I-i know it's not a painter and I know it's not a sculptor, Or--or whatever story it was you couldn't keep straight.
H-hold on.
How do Uh, did, uh, chuck bass say something to you? Chuck ba--what? Wh--so wait, y-you're telling me That chuck bass knows something about our life, And I don't know? I can't talk to you about this right now.
You know, if it was just your lif I would say fine.
But it's not.
It's--it's mine, and it's serena's.
I think we have a right to know.
I agree, but there are other people involved Let me take a wild guess and say lily.
Just give me a day.
There's a right way for all of us to talk About this.
Yeah.
Well, we're--we're past that Hey, b.
, is everything okay? I came as fast as I could.
Fine.
False alarm.
Wait, what happened? Chuck.
He's holed up at victrola In some jim morrison downward spiral.
Sai a way.
Luckily, it's not my concern.
Thank you for coming.
Dorota! I think my guests from the colony club are here! Wait, if chuck is really in trouble, Then we need to help him.
He doesn't have any brothers and sisters.
We are all he has.
You are all he has.
He doesn't want my help.
Oh, hello.
Please take my jacket.
So that's just it? You're gonna abandon him for a bunch of society matrons? Those matrons, as you call them, are helping me build a life.
All chuck can do is destroy one.
I'm not abandoning chuck.
I'm just saving myself.
Now if you'll excuse me Hi, ladies.
Glad you could make it.
Come on in.
That's the problem with an open invitation.
You can't keep out the hoi polloi.
What do you know about my dad and lily? So the cat's out of the bag.
I-i found some numbers.
My--my dad was supposed to be in boston looking for an artist.
He was, uh Apparently visiting some orphanages.
How dickensian.
Chuck, I need to know this.
You know, the funny thing is, I was going to keep lily's secret.
You buried the arson story on my dad.
This makes us even.
You're not the first-born humphrey, So if you were planning on inheriting the family estate, I'd make other arrangements.
Um That--that-- that's not possible.
I mean, my dad-- lily and her mother kept it a secret, Gave the kid away.
I imagine your dad just found out.
And now there's only one more person to tell.
Of course, as soon as you do, it's over between you, isn't it? Sharing a sibling? It's a bit much, even for me.
Spotted-- lonely boy at the victrola, And Chuck Bass, having a heart to heart What or who do they talk about? And will serena be the last to know I've always felt The colony club exemplified the highest ideals of character.
Public service-- I frequently feed the ducks in central park.
And read to blind children.
Impressive.
However, for better or worse, We are known by the company we keep.
Tell me, Was that serena van der woodsen who came earlier? Yes.
She's an old friend.
I see her quite a bit on page six.
And Quite a bit of her.
Well, when I said she was an old friend, It was Habit.
I don't-- Can't approve of how she lives her life.
And her mother married bart bass.
The man was all new money and models.
If you ask me, that car hitting him was a mercy killing.
I hear bass junior is a piece of work.
You wouldn't have anything to do with him, would you? Well, i Blair, the answer is "no.
" Yes.
I mean, no.
I have to go.
That "piece of work"-- chuck bass--needs me.
And serena and her mother are wonderful, kind people.
Blair Do you know what you're doing? I thought I was leaving high school behind.
I guess you never do.
Dorota will get your coats.
Welcome back.
How was thailand? I honestly don't remember.
You should come home, chuck.
I think I'll take the view from above.
It was nice having you as my little brother.
Jenny Eric, where's little j.
? I imagine busy cleaning out her locker.
Actually I just got done writing a "gossip girl" post, Saying how, penelope, for the past six months, You've been having an affair with your dad's junior partner.
And, hazel--you got drunk And hooked up with your cousin Twice.
Oh, my god.
And, isabel Do I even have to say? No.
Those things were told to you in confidence! No, more like stupidity.
And unless you get your parents to back off And you start leaving nelly alone, I hit "send.
" duh, you win.
I know.
So what are you gonna do about the collegiate party tomorrow? What? What are you talking about? Don't play the innocent.
You wanted queen, you've got it.
Wait.
That's what you think I did all this for? Didn't you? No.
No, not at all.
You're telling me this was just a good deed? Oh, my god.
I'm so bored.
Okay Big miscalculation.
See, I kind of thought, coming back to school, You did wanna be queen.
Oh, that's not good.
And I was never gonna move past hazel and is, But I thought maybe if there was a new regime-- wait, you played me? You Nelly yuki? And now she wants to go to the collegiate party.
I'm sorry, jenny.
Penelope! Really, though? So everything Is exactly the same.
Nothing changed.
Everything but you.
Okay.
Hot chocolate? Let me get my coat.
Yeah.
Rufus.
Your message said it was urgent.
Has something happened? Dan knows, or He doesn't yet, But I think he will soon.
And then I imagine he'll tell serena, And I thought you should know.
Rufus, wait.
What will they think of me? Who, serena and eric? Well, it's not my problem.
We're each on our own, remember? Look, you already hate me.
What if they hate me, too? I gave away their Their brother.
I wasn't ready.
I was young and scared Heartbroken over you.
And cece kept pressuring me.
But the truth is, I wasn't ready to have a baby.
And it's been a hole in my life ever since.
I understand Why you gave him up.
But it's that you didn't tell me.
Oh, rufus, please I don't hate you, lil As much as I want to.
Neither will your kids.
But you've had 20 years to make peace with this.
It's gonna take me some time.
What do you wanna know? Hey.
What are you doing here? Uh, weirdly enough, i-i came to see chuck.
Me, too.
Is everything okay? Did you find something in the loft? Kind of.
Uh, can we--can we go to--somewhere to talk Privately, without all of This? Okay.
Blair! Aren't you a little old to be here? Hmm? I heard my nephew is throwing the first big party of the year.
And I have to say, he does the bass name proud.
I can see you've been a wonderful influence on him.
Oh, hey, eric.
Have you seen chuck? Uh, a while ago.
He said something about wanting to take in the view from above.
He probably meant upstairs.
Clearly, you don't know chuck.
He has a thing for rooftops.
Enjoy.
One thing about being on top of the world-- It gives you a long, long way to fall.
Chuck! No! God, you idiot! You don't surprise someone Standing off the edge of a building! Chuck, come away from there.
Let's go down and join the party.
I was at the party.
I'm not really that into it.
Chuck, your father wouldn't he wanted this.
Dear old dad.
Unfortunately, all I know is what he didn't want Which was me.
I'm chuck bass! No one cares.
I do.
Don't you understand? I'll always be here.
I don't want you going anywhere.
I couldn't bear it.
So whatever you want to do to yourself, Please don't do that to me.
Please.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Hey, what--whatever it is, you can tell me.
No, yeah, i-i know.
But it's Uh, it's our parents.
They-- Hold on.
Just Yeah, dad, what's going on? Do you know? Yeah, I do.
Have you told serena? W-well, I was-- I was about to.
I'm with lily.
We're about to go look for our child.
Dad, that-- lily wants to tell serena and eric herself.
Dad, no.
I--you can't ask me to hide this from serena.
This is too big to keep secret.
Son, this isn't your secret to share.
This is between mother and daughter.
I know it's hard, but you have to respect that.
Yeah.
Okay.
Thanks, son.
I'll call you soon.
He should go back to lily's.
He'll just take off again.
I've got a better chance keeping an eye on him.
So you know, I don't trust you.
All I want is what's best for my nephew.
And as for trusting me, do you really have a choice? He can't know what happened on new year's.
Good night, blair.
Ah, me.
The year's scarcely turned, And already the secrets have begun.
Where will it end this time? What is it? Uh, it's--that was my dad.
Uh, he--he and lily are going away for a couple days.
And--and you're worried what'll happen to us.
It's fine.
We're gonna be okay.
The new year is not about what happened It's about what's to come For the past is always with us, Just waiting to d disvered, And when it is, I'll be watching.

I broke up with Aron.
I needed to make sure that we still felt the same.
Soon as that will is read and I get my money, You won't ever see me again.
what are you doing? Or is this not you With my 15-year-old sister? Truth is, I wasn't ready to have a baby.
I understand why you gave him up, But it's that you didn't tell me.
You can't ask me to hide this From Serena.
This is too big to keep secret.
Son, this isn't your secret to share.
It was my dad.
He and Lily are going away for a couple days.
Chuck, your father wouldn't have wanted this.
UnfortuNately, all I know is what he didn't want, Which was me.
I do.
I'll always be here.

But on the upper east side, Death's sad chapter comes with a silver lining Or a gold one, If your relatives invested wisely in precious metals.
Good morning, Jack.
Blair.
Chuck asked me to come To the reading of the will for support.
The only thing he's gonna need support for Is the massive influx into his bank account.
Charming.
Come out with me tonight.
I told you I'm not interested.
Didn't seem that way on new year's.
Whatever may have transpired between us, What's important is what it means to me, Which is nothing.
Do you think it would be nothing to Chuck? Let's ask him now, shall we? Let's not.
Aw.
No one wants to play today, huh? Let's get this over with.
Courage, nephew.
I'm going to be running Bass industries, And you're about to inherit a billion dollars.
I know my father.
There'll be so many strings attached I'll look like a marionette.
He wouldn't miss his last chance to put me in my place.
Hey! Thought you might need some backup.
Thanks.
Let's go.
Hey, let's go.
Okay, wait.
Come on, admit it.
Dad and Lily are totally hooking up On this trip to Boston.
No.
Lily--Lily just lost her husband, And dad is getting her out of town So he can clear her head.
Okay, if that's what you want to call it.
Ooh, headphones on.
No, come on.
You know it's true, And you just don't want to admit it Because you and Serena are back together, And that's the last thing you want Is your parents falling in love again.
Whoa.
they're not in love.
How can you be so sure? because I-I am.
I wouldn't have come to this party if I knew I wasn't v.
i.
p.
The important thing is that Chuck knows we're here for him.
Blair.
Shh.
I can't hear.
Now that we're all settled, please let me express My deepest condolences.
As Mrs.
Bass is unable to be here today, Her interests are being represented by her counsel.
Now, Charles, Your uncle Jack Bass is your closest living relative, And, as such, has been named your legal guardian.
Are you comfortable with this? Curfew? None.
Girls sleeping over? Yes, please.
With regard to mr.
Bass' personal assets, Moving on then.
They will be put in a trust which you, charles, Will have access to on your 18th birthday.
And as for Bass industries? Yes, I was just getting to that.
And a 20% stake in the company has been left to Lily Bass.
Okay, but that still leaves 51%.
That's the controlling interest.
Charles, Mr.
Bass asked me to give you this letter.
If I don't read it, do I still get my inheritance? Well, yes.
Then I'll pass.
Chuck! Is everything okay? Chuck, this letter represents your dad's final words.
Your dad wrote you a letter? you have to read it.
Ye, aren't you curious to know what it says? Think I can guess.
"You're a disappointment of a son.
"I'd die of embarrassment if I wasn't already.
Why do you wear so much purple? "Then you'll have the satisfaction of being right.
No.
I'll read it.
"Dear son, - I know I've always been hard on you.
True.
But my goal was always to prepare you for this day, To help you go from being a boy to a man.
" The italian au pair took care of that.
Chuck, please.
"Sadly, there is nothing like the passing of a father "To aid in this rite of passage for his son.
"Ultimately, I do feel that I did my job "And you're prepared for this next chapter of your life.
"Therefore, I'm bequeathing to you The majority share of Bass industries.
" Surely that's a mistake.
No, it's not.
he believed in you.
That son of a bitch.
-Jack! -no Jack's right.
My father can't be one way my whole life Then all of a sudden, it's okay.
It's nice that he finally decided I'm worthy, But I don't want it.
If you want it, you can have it.
Three times this week I planned a dinner with Jonathan, And every time, Jenny just happened to show up.
Well, she doesn't have anyone else.
All the mean girls hate her.
You gotta give her time to make new friends.
But doesn't she understand the whole point Of having a boyfriend is to be alone? Yes.
seems to be a problem with the entire Humphrey clan.
Dan is avoiding you Because he thinks our parents are getting back together.
You can't really blame him.
Well, I happen to know they're not, So he needs to stop being paranoid.
Okay, so as far as you know hey.
be nice to Jenny.
Hey! hey, eric! okay, guess what? Jonathan and I decided that tonight we are gonna have An edith head film festival.
She says edith head, I say hitchcock.
Same difference.
Great.
count me in.
yay! Oh, wait.
oh, my gosh.
Oh, did you guys know that you have matching backpacks? That's so cute.
oh! Dan.
Dan, hey.
Sorry, I'm a little out of it.
Look, I know you've been avoiding me, But my mom called from boston this morning, And I asked her point-blank.
you have nothing to worry about.
Well, who said anything about being worried? Why, what did she say? That there's nothing going on between her and Rufus.
Well, isn't that what you were worried about? Yeah.
uh, yeah.
I just I was really convinced, But you know, if your mom says nothing's going on, Then that's good.
yeah, well, she usually is Pretty honest about these things-- A little too honest, actually.
Supposedly sarkozy was a bad kisser.
Yeah, well, that's, uh, that's a relief-- Not the thing about sarkozy.
That's kind of disappointing.
So we're good then? Yeah, we are.
absolutely.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
Hey, Dan, what's up? You do realize the whole reason Serena and I broke up Was because she was being so secretive, And now I'm the one keeping secrets.
Lily's gonna talk to Eric and Serena As soon as we get back.
In the meantime, you have to wait just like we do.
I-I just--I don't like lying to my girlfriend.
You know, Serena has a right to know what's going on.
Oh, my god.
We have to tell Serena.
What? we don't know what he's lying about.
Why are you talking? Last time I checked you were still on probation.
We should at least tell blair.
We can't.
Blair's with Chuck again.
I'm really getting sick of how much time She's spending with him.
but his dad just died.
Yeah, like a month ago.
Afraid we're on our own for this one, ladies.
Chuck! stop! It's like he's setting me up to fail from beyond the grave.
Do you really think bart would leave his whole company to you - If he didn't think you could do it? - It doesn't make sense.
My father never trusted me with anything.
He's trusting you now.
he left you his legacy.
I know you can do this.
I wouldn't even know where to begin.
Start by reading the rest of this.
Is lowly lonely boy cheating on our queen? Sound unlikely? Does the name Georgina ring a bell? Get out your shovels and start digging the dirt, kids.
Gossip girl's gonna need a little help Getting to the bottom of this mess.
Chuck.
what's up? forget something? I took a walk around the block, read my father's letter.
If it wasn't notarized, I'd think it was a fake.
Look, I owe you a lot, Jack.
You saved my life when I didn't want to be saved.
Well, you noticed that thai waitress I was gonna take home the other night had a pen1s.
So consider us even.
Look, I've decided to follow my father's wishes And take over Bass industries.
Well, we can discuss that when you turn 18.
Anyway, you're in charge in name.
It's better--all the fun, none of the work.
I want to start now, learning at least.
This isn't an after-school job.
You have no experience.
You're not ready.
If you want to stay in New York, I'll find a place for you in the company.
I know it's going to be a long road But I'm ready now.
You missed one.
Wait, blair.
Do you-- -What do you want, jack? You, obviously.
Hanging up! But barring that, to apologize.
This whole process just wasn't what I was expecting.
I, uh, I want to make it right.
Chuck's the only family I've got.
I know.
Poor Chuck.
Luckily, he has me.
What do you say we throw him a party To celebrate him running the company? Why not celebrate Bart dying? That would be just as tasteless.
Just something to show he has our support.
I'm having dinner with Chuck tonight.
He knows he has my support.
Blair, you know better than anyone how rough Things have been for Chuck lately, And unfortunately, I didn't help the way I reacted this morning.
I really want to do something nice to celebrate.
I'll bring Chuck.
you round up his friends.
And, blair, let's make it a surprise.
Fine.
Brunch tomorrow at the palace.
Sorry for the delay.
I was able to track down the adoptive family Through your mother's lawyer, Mrs.
Bass.
Unfortunately, that's as far as I could take it.
What do you mean as far as you can take it? You haven't taken it anywhere.
.
Rufus, please.
With a closed adoption, The only way the birth parents Can track down and contact their child Is if he registers with a search service.
Your son has not done this.
Look, I wasn't aware of my child Or his adoption when it happened.
I have rights, too.
I'll find my own lawyer.
Rufus, he has a whole life that we are not a part of.
Think of someone other than yourself.
What if I try to get in touch with the adoptive parents? I can't guarantee If they're gonna want to talk to you, But at least I can ask.
Please.
tell them we're in town.
We can meet them immediately Wherever they want.
Yes, of course.
Are you sure this is The best time for a flare-up of Chuck fever? I'm having no such thing.
we're just friends.
He's gone through a lot, and He needs someone to be there.
Anyway, you're the one who told me To help him out in the first place.
Hey, what's up with "gossip girl" Putting out a hit on Dan? excuse me? Apparently, "gossip girl" Is looking for evidence To prove that Dan's cheating on you.
Not that anyone else would Ever want Dan Humphrey.
No offense.
Wait, let me see that.
"nothing yet on 'lonely boy,' But we did find out "He brown bags it for lunch, And today's plat du jour? "A tuna sandwich.
"Disgusting, but not enough for a conviction.
Keep digging, kiddies.
Tuna fish? Why does he make it so hard for himself? Blair, who did this? I see they act alone now.
It's so hard finding obedient minions.
But right now I have to go get ready For my absolutely nonromantic Dinner with Chuck.
Ta.
I'm thinking one paint can of gummy worms And another of swedish fish.
Is this how you and Nate want to celebrate Two months of dating With all things gummy? Is he dragging you to Chuck's brunch, too? We're skipping.
Nate says Our anniversary takes precedence.
Ooh! should I get squirrel nut zippers Or some b.
b.
bat strawberry? I don't know.
candy's candy.
Okay, enough.
You've been walking around for days With a storm cloud over your head.
What is going on? it's annoying.
I really can't talk about it.
Dan, clearly something's up.
So let me help you.
All right, well, if If I tell you, you Can't say anything to anyone Not Nate, not Jenny Especially not Jenny.
No one.
You swear? - Swear.
Swear on your simple machines 7 inches.
b*st*rd.
fine.
swear.
spill.
You know that trip to boston My dad and Lily are on? Uh, they they are They are looking for their son.
What do you mean, "son"? I mean their child, the one tha They had together 19 years ago.
What?! Okay, first of all, lower your voice.
What are you talking about? Lily gave the child up for adoption And dad never knew.
Now I can't say anything to Serena Because Lily wants to be the one to tell her.
I can't believe you're telling me this Now in a candy store.
Well, you begged me to, so please help me.
Here.
okay.
sorry.
For starters, stop avoiding her Or you're gonna wind up Ruining your relationship all on your own.
So unfortunately That means you go to Chuck Bass' brunch.
Oh, no.
how could you do it? How could you cheat on Serena again? I didn't.
Brooklyn pig.
How could you let him do it, v.
? You know who I am? Please.

Who are you cheating with? Nobody.
I'm not ch-- no, I-I'm not.
I'm not doing this again.
I can't deal with this.
You, stay.
I'll catch up in a minute.
All right.
I hope you don't mind.
I let myself in.
I've made my decision, Jack.
I know.
And I owe you an apology.
The fact is, you're Bart's son, and it is your rightful place.
Your blessing means a lot to me.
Good.
Now before we start spooning, I want to take you out tonight to properly celebrate.
I'm having dinner with Blair.
Reschedule Blair.
I can't.
She's been a good friend to me.
Yeah, I saw you two talking this morning.
The last time I had a friend like that, - I wind up with gonorrhea.
Suprax? Rocephin.
I mean, Is this who you imagined Chuck Bass to be-- A man who spends his day at the office And then goes home to the wife? it's no coincidence Your father had his most success when he was single.
I, uh, invited a few friends to join us.
I guess I'll have to entertain them on my own.
Last chance.
What's it gonna be, Chuck-- business and Blair Or cocktails and coquettes? Serena, hey.
Hey.
I just dropped Dan off at the loft if you--
Oh, no. I came to see you. I'm here on a rather pathetic mission. I'm boyfriend snooping.
I see.
yeah, - it's not something I'm proud of, But i-i don't know what else to do.
Something's going on with Dan, And I thought I knew what it was, but i-i don't.
I was wondering if he said anything to you.
No, he didn't.
I'm sorry.
Oh, I figured if-- If he would've told anyone, he would have told you.
Um, whatever it is, I'm sure he'll tell you.
Dan's not really one for keeping secrets.
Yeah, I-I I used to think that, But, um I-I don't know anymore.
Okay.
Well, thanks anyway.
Bye.
When R Lily & Rufus back? S need to know their child You stole Dan Humphrey's phone? Not bad, Nelly.
At this rate,You'll be off probation Before your second marriage.

From Chunk Bass Sorry, working late.
Next time Looks like Chuck Bass made his choice.
But careful, Bass.
now that you're a big fish, There are a lot more sharks in this pond.
I can't even pretend to read this anymore.
How long are we gonna sit around here waiting? Hasn't even been 24 hours yet.
Just give it a chance.
Yeah, but they may not make a decision for days.
I've already missed the reading of Bart's will.
Hello? Yes.
She's right here.
And what did they say? Well, did you tell 'em we're not looking for anything, Just a conversation? Yes, well, I'm sorry, too.
They don't want to meet.
They don't want us to contact them ever.
Rufus - well, that's it, then.
I guess I'll go back.
Who are those people? Members of the board of Bass industries.
Jack wanted Chuck to be able to get to know them In a more casual setting.
so how was your non-date with Chuck last night? He had to reschedule.
Spare me those expressive eyebrows.
I can't wait till you get botox.
I'm just saying-- You're just saying nothing.
Chuck is taking this really seriously, And I'm proud of him.
end of story.
This is Jack.
he's pulling up with Chuck.
Now you'll see we're just friends.
Dan, it's okay.
whatever's going on with you and Serena, It's still good that you came.
And you know I wouldn't pass up an opportunity To celebrate Chuck Bass.
exactly.
um, I'm gonna go find Eric, But text me if you need any moral support.
I can't.
I lost my phone.
I'm stuck with dad's old cell.
It practically has a rotary dial.
wow.
well, good luck.
Hey! you came.
I love brunch.
you had waffles and eggs And little kipper-looking things in the same spot.
I-i love this meal.
it's perfect.
I know.
Not to mention you're here.
uh, I'd be crazy not to come.
Excuse me.
please be quiet.
Chuck and his uncle Jack are on their way up.
Where's Chuck? Relax.
he's in his office.
I don't know how much he'll get done after the night we had.
What? I thought that he was working.
Blair? we need to talk to you.
it's important.
We put a hit on Dan Humphrey on "gossip girl"-- Why are you bothering me about "gossip girl" right now? Go! we wanted your okay before we release what we have.
Fine.
whatever.
release it.
go breathe somewhere else.
Bombs away, girls.
What do you mean Chuck was out with you last night? Jack, where's our guest of honor? Pete, alice, glad you could make it.
Blair, this is pete holmberg, alice cashman, Members of Bass industries' board.
Nice to meet you.
Chuck's hard at work upstairs, actually.
You should go see him.
Perhaps Blair could show you the way.
Gladly.
So what do you and jonathan want to do tonight? Actually, uh, jonathan and i Were thinking of just hanging out tonight, Just the-- just the two of us.
Oh, okay.
Come on, Jenny.
we hang out with you all the time.
So? don't act like you're doing me some big favor.
Okay, you're acting ridiculous.
Me? I wasn't gonna say anything, But ever since you started dating jonathan, It's like, "my boyfriend this and my boyfriend that.
" It's okay, we get it.
You have a boyfriend but-- yes, I do, and I'm sorry that you don't, But it doesn't mean I have to invite you out every time we have plans.
You are so conceited.
You are so annoying.
So, uh, my question-- And it's been bothering me for a while-- Can you reserve eclairs? I know.
cruel, right? why--why put them out? I'm so glad you came.
mm-hmm.
What now, people? it's not like I brought a tuna sandwich.
Hold on to your floppy cable-knit hats, kids.
Lonely boy's secret is out, and this one's a doozy.
D.
wasn't cheating, But there's definitely a third party involved.
Seems d.
and s.
share a sibling.
While I'm always a fan of star-crossed lovers, At least romeo and juliet didn't share d.
n.
a.
Chuck.
That is Chuck Bass? Yeah.
who the hell are you? Pete holmberg.
I'm on the board of Bass industries.
Oh, Chuck, didn't your father teach you? Never mix business with pleasure.
This can't be true.
I need you to tell me this isn't true.
And you knew.
What the hell? Look, I didn't realize you were going to be here.
clearly.
We knew this was your reputation.
When we learned your father had left you the company, We had hoped he knew something we didn't.
Apparently, that is not the case.
I don't know what bart was thinking.
How could you? Did you do all this? What? Throw you a brunch? Try to do something nice, supportive? yes.
I don't need your help.
stop trying to play the wife.
Serena, please.
Look, my dad made me promise not to say anything.
Your mom wanted to tell you herself, okay? That's why I was avoiding you before.
i-i couldn't bear To be around you if I couldn't be honest with you.
I'm--i'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
okay.
No, I get it, okay? i-i just don't und-- We should probably call them now and let them know that you know.
Don't.
just--not yet.
Is that why they're in boston? Yeah.
Is this true? Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
Well, I guess it makes sense that we fight like siblings.
Yeah.
look, it's obviously a lot to absorb, But I think we should wait until we get all the facts.
Serena.
Dan, i-i'm sorry.
I just need some time to process this alone.
Oh, hey.
I was just gonna call down And have our car brought around.
I don't think I'm ready to go.
Rufus.
What, Lily? the family could change their mind.
We should write them a letter And explain that we just want to meet the boy.
The parents don't want that.
What about what I want? this works out well for you.
You don't want to meet your son.
Oh.
you don't think I haven't thought about this boy Every day of his life? You want to meet him.
Have you thought about what happens after that? What if we find out he's had a horrible life? Or what if we instantly love him, And then it's very clear that we've made a terrible mistake? My only fear is feeling like we failed to try everything.
Well, we can keep trying from new york.
We don't have to stay here.
why, not, lil? it's another day.
Is that too much to ask?! Yes.
yes, it is, because this whole search has been So excruciating, I don't want to go through it anymore.
I don't want to spend another day, yet another minute, Trapped in this hotel room, Scared that you're gonna hate me forever, When I'm still in love with you.
Lily.
I just can't believe you--you don't remember.
It--it was our first show in Paris And you decided to stand on the front of the stage No.
and then you got really mad Because the drummer from buffalo Tom groped you.
no? - No.
you- -no? okay.
now you're starting to scare me.
I just can't believe we were in Paris together, And we spent the entire time in a dirty club in marais.
Maybe we should go back, do it again.
Oh, I would love that.
Me, too.
Hello? Yeah, this is he.
All right.
thank you.
Thank you so much.
That was Chris Rosson, the adoptive father.
mm-hmm.
He doesn't want his wife to know, But he wants to meet with us.
You're my only family.
How could you do this to me? You did it to yourself.
Clearly, I was right, but you aren't ready.
You have your own life, your own company.
Sure.
in Australia.
My dear brother literally placed me On the other side of the world.
I did everything right.
I ran that place without complaint, And it thrived under my watch.
And this is how he repays me? By giving the company to a teenager Who can't keep his pecker in his pants for 24 hours? At least I can keep mine in service - For longer than five minutes.
You can have that.
I'll take Bass industries.
It's not yours to take.
my father gave it to me.
Actually There is one stipulation attached to your appointment-- Morality clause.
Bart knew his son.
He specified that should you in any way act inappropriately, The board has the option to replace you With your legal guardian, Which--wouldn't you know it? is me.
I already talked to the board.
I'm in charge now.
Are you sure you're okay with this? Yes.
yes, it's time.
Thanks.
Mr.
Humphrey? Miss Bass? Yes.
it's uh, so--so nice to meet you.
Thank you so much for calling us.
Uh.
please, sit down.
I have something I have to tell you.
Can I, um, Can I come in? Have you, uh, have you spoken to mom yet? No.
it went straight to voice mail.
Yeah, me, too.
are you okay? Not really.
I'm so mad at her for keeping this from us, But at the same time, I feel incredibly sad for her And Rufus.
Yeah, I know.
sounds like it's got grandma written all over it.
It reeks of gin and chanel no.
five.
It is so weird that we have a half Something.
And so do Dan and Jenny.
Are you and Dan gonna be okay? I don't know.
I had enough trouble With the idea of mom and Rufus dating, But now I share a sibling with my boyfriend? That's--that's a little more hillbilly than I can handle.
It is a little twisted.
but so what, right? Well, what if we can't get past it? I don't know.
But you can't push Dan away right now.
Whatever you are going through, He's going through the same thing.
Oh.
hey.
I was just, uh, I was looking for Vanessa.
Oh, she's just in the back.
she's getting ready.
We're about to, uh, about to head out.
That's right.
your anniversary.
Yeah.
you wanna wait? Um, no.
just tell her I came by.
Okay.
Dan, Dan, hey.
I saw the blast, and I know what you're going through.
Really? you found out you and your girlfriend Share a sibling you never knew you had? Well, uh, no.
at least not yet.
But hey, I do know what it's like To have the most painful details Of your personal life made public.
Yeah.
Yeah, it kind of blows.
And i-i-i know it feels like nothing good can come of it.
Going through all of that, I found out who my real friends were.
Yeah.
well, I mean, she-- vanessa really cares about you.
I was actually talking about you.
And I'm I'm really sorry about what happened -I never meant --oh, you know what? it's--it's okay.
I mean, this whole thing has actually made me nostalgic For the days when Jenny was the problem.
Speaking of which, I should go check on her.
I mean, today's been tough on her, obviously.
-Uh, uh, tell v.
that I came by.
Yes, I-I will, man.
sure.
-Thanks.
-bye.
It was last year.
Andrew was sailing with some friends.
They jumped in the water.
Andrew got caught in a riptide.
We're so sorry.
um Yeah, if we had known, we Wouldn't have even bothered you.
It's my wife.
She's had trouble with it.
It was too painful for her to tell you, Because, uh Well, it's too painful for her to tell anyone.
This is from the newspaper.
Um, I just need to know.
Was he happy? Very.
He always had a smile on his face from the beginning.
I'm sorry.
I screwed up.
It's too late, Chuck.
I have stood by you through all of this, But I can't watch you self-destruct any longer.
Jack set me up.
There's no one to blame but yourself.
I believed in you.
Your father believed in you.
You Are the only one who didn't.
All I wanted to do was Just be there.
But today, when you called me your wife, You made it sound like the ugliest word in the world.
Blair please.
I'm sorry But I'm done.
Have you, um, talked to Serena? Uh, no, and i-i don't expect to anytime soon.
Okay.
Well, I say we could both use a distraction, So I say we play boggle or watch a trashy movie.
I rented "showgirls.
" - Oh, no, boggle.
I don't think I can sit through "showgirls" again.
again? seriously? Okay, so are we really not gonna talk about it? No.
You know, and-- and the worst part of it was That all I wanted to do was spend every minute with you.
I-i couldn't because I had to keep this huge secret.
Well, it's--it's okay.
I--i wouldn't have known what to do either.
You know, i through all this, I-i had so many thoughts going through my head, But the one that kept popping up again and again What--what does this mean for us? I don't know, but--but we'll figure it out.
Because I know no matter what, I want to be with you.
Me, too.
And there's gotta be some kind of precedent for this, right? Yeah.
yeah.
there's got-- in literature.
Uh, toni morrison, maybe, Flannery o'connor The--the russian aristocrats, Before they all became hemophiliacs or "clueless.
" Alicia silverstone's character dated her ex-stepbrother, And they made it work.
that's super skeevy.
Thank you.
that makes me feel so much better.
-I'm really -no, I'm s-- Sorry.
there.
I said it first.
ha ha.
-thanks.
But, uh, I really should be the one to apologize.
I mean, you have every right to want to be alone with jonathan.
Yeah, but it doesn't mean you get on my nerves that much.
It's okay.
I want to get on your nerves.
-Oh, really? -uh, yeah.
that's what family does.
Hey, can we get some sandwiches? sure.
two p.
b.
and j.
coming right up.
The problem with inheritance is That it's not always as simple as it sounds.
Sometimes you get more than you bargained for Is it over? They won't be back.
I feel awful.
We had to do it.
they have money, lawyers.
They wouldn't have stopped.
We've already lost one son.
We weren't losing another.
Or you discover that in gaining one thing, You've lost something else.
You know, I guess the idea of this child Always made me feel connected to you, And I guess A part of me never gave up On the idea that we would Finally come together eventually.
But Maybe we weren't meant to be a family.
But every once in a while, the fates smile upon you And you get the one thing you really need.

Gossip Girl's here, your one and only source Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's Elite.
I've decided to take over bass industries There is one stipulation-- that should you in any way Act inappropriately, the board has the option To replace you with your legal guardian, Which--wouldn't you know it? Is me.
I had enough trouble With the idea of mom and rufus dating, But now I share a sibling with my boyfriend? Maybe we weren't meant to be a family.
Serena, dean berube.
I'd like to issue a press release That you came up to visit our glorious campus.
Princeton is a trade school.
There is only yale He said that yale could really use a girl like blair waldorf.
Oh, b.
, I'm so happy for you.
True love and betrayal, revenge and more revenge, A heroine with an impossible goal-- If only mozart had lived on the upper east side.
Blair bear, you'll be late! But you can keep your magic flute, amadeus.
All this queen wants is a golden ticket to yale.
You look like a firing squad.
More like a welcoming committee.
It's the big day.
It's all the color of yale.
You see? That's just what I need to perk me up.
I couldn't sleep a wink.
We know.
We heard you watching "gilmore girls" All night, again.
Oh.
I am so a better fit for yale than that rory.
Dorota.
Don't be sad.
I'm not going anywhere for six months.
That wasn't dorota, dear.
That was handsome dan.
Look at him.
Yeah, he's a gift from all of us.
Oh! He's the yale mascot, bulldog-- Oh! Just like you after today.
I don't know about the name, though.
We should just call him "handsome.
" You're adorable.
Yes, just don't look behind sofa.
No, you're a shoo-in, darling.
Mademoiselle.
Merci.
A shoo-in.
The personal letter that I wrote to dean berube Should simply cinch it.
We will celebrate your acceptance tonight at the oper Withhahampag at all intermissions.
We will be so drunk.
By the time someone dies, we'll just laugh.
Is chuck joining us? You know how he loves a good tragedy.
Yes.
Where is mr.
Chuck? I wouldn't know, and I don't care.
He's as dead to me as his father is to him.
More blueberries.
Whew! Yale day.
Good morning.
Mm.
I thought we could walk to school together for support.
I keep telling myself that everything happens for a reason.
You know, I'll--i'll end up in the right place, But what if I don't get in? Pfft.
Forget you.
What if I do and blair doesn't? Fire and--and brimstone and a lot of bitchy asides, Death by dorota.
Thanks.
You don't have to worry either.
Blair's a lock.
The dean told her as much, right? Yeah.
Yeah, yale is good.
We're good.
Everything will be fine.
You're referring to the recent not fun event, Uh, also known as the "you two share a brother, Oh, wait.
No, you don't" roller coaster.
Not to be outdone by the tila-whirl Called "discovering this fact has only served To bringing rufus and lily closer than ever.
" Look, getting into yale will change our lives.
It'll give us a chance to reinvent ourselves.
Yeah.
Yeah, and in the meantime, At least our parents are keeping it on the down low.
Yeah.
Rufus, stop it.
Oh, hello.
I was planning on sneaking out before anyone got up, But lily and I got to bed so late.
Oh, You don't--you-- that's--just stop there Right.
Well, now that this is all out in the open, Maybe we can stop sneaking around.
I mean, we've had the awkward run-in, and it isn't so bad.
I don't know why we thought this would be so weird.
Let's leave now.
Nice try, mom.
Yeah, seriously good effort.
So I was thinking, tonight-- More than four hours of sleep? That, and there is a charity gala at the opera.
A full 12 hours then.
Oh, everyone will be there.
It's the--it's the event of the season, And I'm really feeling ready to get back to the world.
Aren't you worried about people seeing us together so soon? The kids know.
Why shouldn't the world? And, uh, we might as well make our society debut in style.
I was just trying to get out of the opera part.
I'm not a fan.
Well, you can become one tonight.
Mm.
I would say, "get a room," but yours is right above mine.
Please try to remember that.
Oh, my god.
No, I told you, under 18, and I want verification.
I don't care where you have to import them from.
I want them young and unstable.
You can cancel that order.
I already ate.
I'll get right back to you.
Your bush league attempts to take me down-- They're getting boring.
Although, I must admit, Having the freshman class of brearley Hold their annual sleepover in my hotel room-- That was a nice touch.
By the way, don't be alarmed, But, uh, our stock might take a little dip today.
I'm still adjusting to a learning curve.
No, what you're doing is trying too hard You're obviously not cut out for ehjob,b, Which is why bart never let you out of the outback.
You should be more careful.
Or what? It's my company now, kid.
You saw to that.
Will the, uh, board and I be seeing you at the opera tonight? Even though you're no longer in charge, You are still the public face of the company.
I think it's important you display it, Show there's no hard feelings.
Maybe I'll show them they made the wrong choice instead.
Oh, wait.
You're already doing that for me, aren't you? No matter.
We probably won't be seeing much of each other anyway.
I'll be in your father's seats, And you'll be, well, somewhere else.
There's a new kid.
That "kid" is my shakespeare teacher, miss carr.
That-that's miss carr? Does she have benjamin button syndrome? Here.
Let us help you.
It's all right.
Oh, thank you, serena.
It's like holding a door Never occurred to anybody.
No, Not on the upper east side.
These kids have probabl Never touched a door in their life.
They just magically open for them, don't they Oh, uh, this is my boyfriend, dan humphrey.
Hi.
Dan, this is miss carr.
She's my favorite New teacher.
Well, I've heard a lot about you Although i-i wasn't expecting you to look so Out of place? No, I was gonna say "young.
" you could pass for a student.
Well, I was, until recently I've been doing teach for america The past two years in alabama.
This is my first salaried job.
I've never even been to new york before.
It's a lot different than des moines.
My family is in the hotel business, And the palace lobby is a wonderful place To get away from the noise.
Yeah, and, You know, if you're ever in brooklyn Uh, my dad has a gallery.
There's a pretty cool ca.
E.
Ooklyn--that's, uh, the place across the bridge, right Ha ha.
Yeah.
You'll fit in just fine Here.
Oh, hey, don't let the city get to you See you third period.
Mm-hmm.
Nice meeting you, daniel.
Nice meeting you, miss carr.
So good luck today.
You, too.
May the best get in.
Refresh.
Refresh.
Refresh.
That's not my eli account.
No, It's mine.
I applied to yale, too, remember Yes, but your application was Merely a formality to appease your overbearing parents.
You know very well There's no way yale is going to accept someone Who got a 2360 on her s.
A.
T.
S, So give up and go for the gold, my gold.
Refresh.
Hey, are you going to the opera thing tonight? Um, yeah.
Serena's taking me.
Yeah? I might go, too.
You know, for a while, I couldn't take vanessa Anywhere really nice, 'cause of the whole no money thing, But I saw a dvd of the "ring" cycle at her house, And I figured she might like some champagne In my family's box.
Yeah, that's good.
That's good.
Don't tell her you saw that dvd Though, 'cause i-i pointed it out once, If you've ever seen "a clockwork orange," You know how that ended up.
Wait.
What's "a clockwork orange"? Charles, I didn't expect to see you today.
Or ever, if I had it my way.
Yes, well, I missed you, too.
I'm trying to do something.
I really wanted to do it on my own, But that's not working.
I'm thinking you're the only person left who can help.
What do you say? What are you guys doing? Shh.
Don't talk to them.
They're working.
Refresh.
My God.
What? What is it? Congratulations, Serena van der Woodsen.
You have been accepted I'm sorry.
I I simply can't read it.
It says "wait-listed" in bold.
I got in.
I did it.
I got in.
Oh, my gosh! I can't believe it.
Oh, did you? Um No.
No, no.
Um, I'm wait-listed, just like blair.
Well, don't worry.
You'll get in.
We'll be together next fall.
Even if you have to wait Another couple of months to find out for sure, It's all good, or it will be.
Yeah, I know it will.
I need to see the headmistress.
Right now! They say that it's not over till the fat lady sings.
But who's that I hear tuning up in the wings? Sorry, b.
I think it's curtains.
Only usual moves have them worked Jack's blood He thinks too much like me, sees me coming.
And the way he's running the business, I worry everything my father had worked for will be lost.
Since you're part of the company now, I thought you might care.
I do care, charles, But my concern is for you, not the company.
You're living alone.
Why don't you move back in here? It'll make it a lot easier to work Together.
I'm not interested in a family reunio Nor in assuaging your guilt over my father's death.
Do you believe in my cause or not? I do, But your shenanigans-- planting coke in his gym bag, Ambushing him with a transsexual hooker Two.
They owed me a favor.
Will only cast a negative light on you in the board's eyes.
I don't care about the board anymore.
You should.
You need them.
So let me help you by handling this like a grownup.
My 20% stake in bass industries Must count for something, and when I'm done, Perhaps you'll reconsider your living situation.
Don't hold your breath.
Meet me here at 2:00? How did this happen? Dean berube said I was a perfect fit.
His exact words were, "yale could use a girl like blair waldorf.
" Well, apparently, they found one somewhere else.
Calm yourself.
When I spoke to dean berube this morning, He assured me that if the student they've accepted Turns them down, you are next in line.
Dan humphrey? He's like a cafeteria lady who won the lottery.
You couldn't pry that acceptance from his hands With the jaws of life.
I wasn't speaking about mr.
Humphrey.
Someone from constance got in? Blair, in our school's history, most wait-listed students Ultimately get into the college of their choice.
Your transcript is a series of unblemished a's.
All you have to do is keep up your g.
P.
A.
, and you'll get in.
I know that patience and trust Aren't necessarily your strong suits, But you'll just have to rise to the occasion, hmm? Thank you.
I'm sure I can do that.
Just tell me who got in.
You got in? Congratulations.
Oh, shh.
Don't say it too loud.
I haven't told anyone yet, Not even dan, especially not blair.
Well, why not? Oh, i-i couldn't.
She was s it-listed.
It would have been a disaster.
A word of unsolicited advice-- It sounds like you're worrying about other people When this is a decision about you.
Do you want yale? Do you know you're the first person That's ever asked me that? The truth is, I don't--i don't know.
The whole reason I went there in the first place Was because of blair, and then I applied because of dan.
Honestly, I think yale Might be accepting me for the wrong reasons.
I would never advise anyone to turn down a great opportunity, But going to the right school for you Is the most important thing.
Serena, did you hear someone from constance got in? I bet it's that little nelly.
When I find her, she's not gonna know--hello.
Blair, I missed you first period.
I had a meeting.
You also missed getting this back.
I'll talk to you later, serena.
Bye.
Well, if you're on a witch hunt, That means you can't be too upset, right? Witch hunts are my valium, serena.
I'just trying to stay calm.
What about you? I have to say, I'm totally surprised yale passed up The p.
R.
Of accepting "it" girl serena van der woodsen.
They have more class than I thought.
Well, like you pointed out, they didn't want me for me.
Dan must be pissed.
His hope of arriving on campus with cachet Has been shot to hell.
Now he'll just be lumped in With the rest of the financial aid-iots and poets.
Oh, my god.
What? I have to go.
Hello? Miss van der woodsen, This is shirley from dean berube's office.
The dean would love to issue a press release That you'll be joining yale's freshman class in the fall, Assuming you're accepting.
Would you mind? Miss van der woodsen? Um, i-i-i'm gonna have to call you back.
Charles has left us no choice.
We wish you had been left in charge of the company, Of course, but that's not how it laid out.
Well, surely there must be something.
Jack is charles' guardian, And the contract clearly states that his guardian has control.
Short of being able to prove he's completely negligent, All we can do is our best to temper his actions.
Minority shareholders' meeting.
We were just finishing up.
See you soon, I hope, lilian? Yes, peter, I'd like that.
Had I known my own personal mata hari was going to be here, I would have come sooner.
Yes, well, I was just being brought up to date On your progress or lack thereof.
I'll right myself eventually.
I just have to get my legs under me.
Maybe the two of us could come together in some way, Help me find my strength Or use it all up.
What's that for? Your nose.
You don't seem so worried About the same morality clause that cost charles this company.
They won't touch me.
Although I may not be doing a bang-up job yet, It beats having a woman of your reputation at the helm.
This is a "b.
" Yes, it is.
You're new here, so you don't know how it works.
I have a feeling you're about to explain.
Second semester seniors get a free pass Like pregnant ladies or 14-year-old chinese gymnasts.
Constance wants their students to get into the best colleges.
That's why this free pass exists.
The headmistress-- if she knew about this grade-- She'd rap you on the wrist.
Maybe in time, I'll get in trouble For not inflating grades like everyone else, miss waldorf, But until then, I'll give them based on merit.
I need to keep my g.
P.
A.
Perfect to get into yale.
You should have thought of that before.
What's wrong? I think I might have just lost yale.
What am I gonna do? I didn't apply anywhere else.
Just hold on a second.
There's a phone call I have to return.
The b*st*rd is untouchable.
Well, what should we do? Time to get dirty.
I'm all ears.
Let me educate you.
Did you really try to buy anthrax with his credit card? The black market isn't what it used to be.
And you got him on megan's list? If only his apartment were a few blocks closer to a playground.
Look, I understand why you're trying to do these things, But we have got to do something that is not illegal.
I've put calls in To jack's business associates in australia.
He's not the most upstanding citizen.
I'm sure we will find something.
You know, i, um, I thought I lost you the day of the funeral, And, um, I'm sorry That jack's the one to bring us back together, But I'm glad that we're doing this.
If your people don't come up with anything, Maybe we could try number 26.
"crash jack in plane.
" The bass jet is kind of expensive, charles.
There's insurance.
Hello? Yes.
Yeah, that would be fine.
I can't really talk right now.
Yes, the, uh, the opera has an early curtain.
Rufus, stop it.
Okay, okay.
I'll s yououhehe Bye.
I can't believe you.
You're actually going To take your half-price hustler out on the town tonight.
I thought we were putting this behind us, charles.
I'm here to help you.
And what part of you dating someone else A month after my father's death is helping me? You say you want to be family, but if you really meant it, You wouldn't parade your mistress in public.
You'd have some tact, Some respect.
This isn't about your father, charles.
I should have known from your history I couldn't count on you.
You think of yourself.
Your kids and my dead father are proof of that.
Hey, serena.
Hey, I was thinking maybe we could go to yale this weekend, Get some hope into you.
She's going down.
Would you excuse me for a second? Not really.
I know that look.
You're up to no good.
Good is subjective, And if you don't believe me, you can look it up.
You want to get rachel back for the grade she gave you A new teacher's like a child.
It has to be taught.
And spanked.
And I can't risk not getting into yale, So it's open season on miss iowa.
Time to shuck the corn.
I wasn't supposed to say anything, But you--you are going to yale.
You got in, an early admission.
What? How do you know that? Because I declined my acceptance.
You're next in line.
They're gonna call you in a couple hours.
Whoa.
You--you got in? You're the constance student? Cancel the nelly yuki project now! S.
, why would you turn down yale? And don't say for me, because even I wouldn't believe you.
Yeah, why--why would you do that? I'm--i'm sorry.
I-i wanted to tell you.
You don't want to go? No.
No, I don't.
No, please.
I'll--i'll see you later.
So--so you're not gonna go after rachel now, right? What would be the point? Okay, okay.
Hey, so the reason I asked you to come down Is because-- no, wait, wait, wait.
Me first.
Okay.
Okay, ever since you got your money back, You've been taking me to do all these archibald-y things, Which I love.
I just can't keep up.
So I decided to do something for us.
We're going to the opera night.
Wow.
That is fantastic.
They're nosebleed seats, but at least they're something, And I got them.
So what did you bring me up here for anyway? Well, there's no reason.
I just wanted to see you.
And then the--the queen of the night Sings this kick-ass aria, "der holle rache kocht in meinem herzen," "the vengeance of hell boils in my heart.
" Lovely.
It is.
It reaches a high "f"--that-- that never happens in operas.
You know, that's a good fact.
You should talk about it at intermission.
You're gonna love "the magic flute.
" it's, Uh, well, it's It's okay.
You can say it Opera for amateurs.
If anybody asks you what you thought, just tell 'em, "ist war wunderschien.
Danke.
Und sie?" That's what klaus always used to say.
Well, that and--and "geh zum teufel," But, um, whatever you do, don't--don't say that.
Okay, this is ridiculous.
Dad, lily loves you 'cause you're not That guy.
Eh.
This feels a little different Only 'cause you're letng it.
No, He's right.
In our world, people say one thing But they expect something else.
If you can hold your own, It'll go a long way with my mom and her friends.
Everyone can geh zum teufel.
I just want to do right by her.
Let's talk "singspiel," shall we? "singspiel.
" The devil would say, "you're already in yale.
You have security.
Now more than ever, you can do what you want.
" And an angel would say, "all the more reason not to.
You have what you want.
" You don't have a perfect transcript.
But you don't need one.
You're in.
Ugh! I hate having to play the angel.
I know.
The devil is so much better.
So, b.
, who won? Gimme.
Hello.
Miss carr? It's blair waldorf.
How did you get my number? I wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier.
I was hoping you'd afford me e e chan to move past it.
I'd like that, too, But couldn't this have waited till we saw each other again? That's precisely why I'm calling.
Did you know the school has a block of tickets To the opera tonight? To the opera? No, I didn't know that.
Oh, yes.
It's a gala event, and my family, Who's heard all about you, asked if you could come to dinner And then join us in our grand tier seats afterwards.
I don't think that's such a good idea in light of today Or at all.
Nonsense.
We have an extra ticket.
You're not gonna let our little disagreement Stand in the way of the opera? I-i have always wanted to go.
Do you have a pen handy? Spotted--b.
Hot for teacher.
Too bad miss carr Doesn't remember the devil is in the details.
What do you say the boathouse in central park? We meet at 6:30 and walk over for curtain at 8:00.
Thank you.
Sounds wonderful.
Yes.
Yes, it does.
So if you get into yale Yeah.
And you go to brown--you did still apply there, right? Yeah.
That means two trips for us.
Or one.
We could go to providence first, And then hit new haven on the way back.
And stop At the newport creamery on the way down for milkshakes.
Oh! Oh, my gosh, we coultatake a week.
We could take our time.
New england is so lovely in the fall.
We could bring jenny and eric.
That sounds great.
I can't wait.
Box two.
Uh, row two.
Two for you.
Thanks.
You know what? Uh, if you'll excuse me? Uh, no, thank you.
Uh Am I glad to see you.
Serena and I had to meet up with our parents before we got here, And it went from "family ti" " toaulkner Ooh.
In one cocktail flat.
Uh, hey, you excited about your box? My what? Oh, hey, we're on the third tier, actually.
Yeah.
It's, um, a better view and straight on.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Well, third tier's awesome.
What's going on here? Nothing.
Nothing's going on.
Okay, so there might be some other seats Available to us.
Lily.
Didn't know you'd be here.
Who's your lucky escort this evening? Someone you picked up at the funeral? Mm, this is rufus humphrey, the man I'm seeing.
Mm.
You remember pauletta cho? She's head of publicity for my company.
Our company.
Yes, hi.
It's nice to see you, pauletta.
But your choice of companion? Not so nice.
I'm here to keep an eye on him more than anything else.
Hope you both enjoy the show.
And if not, you can ponder why You thought coming here together was a good idea.
Enjoy "tristan und isolde.
" Okay.
This isn't "the magic flute"? Oh, no.
That opera ended weeks ago, and it's mainly for kids.
Ah, kids.
You gotta love 'em.
Yeah.
They do such great things, like misread the opera calendar.
Bruce, hello.
Hey, my condolences about bart.
I-i haven't wanted to call.
I-i didn't want to be a bother in your--your time of grief.
Uh, well, now that you're here, what do you want me to do About those, uh, duments I'd been working on? Um Could you wait here for just a moment? What's going on? I just need to talk to charles.
Um, you two can just talk about opera while I'm gone.
The answer is so simple.
How could I have forgotten it? Any chance you could try and forget me? Just meet me back here in 15 minutes.
And if you don't like what I suggest, I won't bother you again.
You have my word.
You don't have any binoculars, do you? Oh, or how about those cool little spy glasses? Or a telescope.
All right, I get it.
You want to go to the stupid box.
Not if you don't want to.
Once the show starts, I'm sure it'll be great from up here.
Yeah.
Candy, dear? You know, it's not that You don't want to go to the same college as me.
It's not? No.
A lot of couples go to different schools.
But, you know, for months, You acted like going to yale together was what you wanted.
Well, I didn't figure it out until today.
And brown is just a better fit for me, dan.
Well, and what about us? I mean, do we still "fit"? Well, it's--it's not like we have to decide anything now.
We can just-- what? We can go on having you make choices That affect both of our lives without you talking to me? Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I was just-- I was so happy about yale.
If we went together, you know, We'd get four years away From--from everything and from Everyone.
But it looks like our lives are gonna follow us to college, Wherever we go.
And what if our parents stay together? What happens then? More uncomfortable dinners? Adjoining rooms on family vacations? Pretending not to hear what we hear In the middle of the night? I mean, who knows how long that's gonna last for? Well, you know, I think we'll just have to compartmentalize everythgn The--the two of them will be its own thing That we'll put in a box and just keep away somewhere.
Things don't just go in boxes.
They go all together.
No, they don't.
No, they--they go in boxes with really tight lids That you bury deep in holes at the bottom of the ocean.
Okay.
Providence is just a train ride from new haven.
I think we're just gonna have to try and push through The next couple of months.
Yes.
And knowing them, it--it won't last, right? I mean, it can't.
It could never.
I, uh, studied the wrong opera.
I wanted to impress you and your friends, And prove that I could exist in both your world and mine.
Oh, rufus.
I don't care what anyone thinks.
You exist in our world, and it's the only world that matters.
Thanks for trying.
Oh.
Oh, god.
Where are the boxes with the lids? Why don't you guys head, um, up to our seats? I--there's something I have to handle first.
Okay.
Yeah.
Right behind you.
Here we go.
And, uh.
Darling, turn off your phone.
Remember the kevin kline incident? Hello, headmistress queller.
Blair, I'm sorry to call you after hours, But ms.
Carr told me how upset you were about your grade.
She did? I confirmed with her That so long as the rest of your grades Were up to your usual high standard, That you would still end the course with an "a.
" It was sweet of ms.
Carr to be so concerned.
She's a good asset to the school.
I think she cares about her students.
She cares about their futures.
Have a good weekend.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
The opera's about to begin.
It can wait.
I have to fix something.
Who's this? Bruce caplan.
I'm your father's family lawyer.
Before he died, Your dad was going to legally adopt serena and eric.
And I was going to legally adopt you.
We were serious about becoming a real family, And we'd had the papers drawn, and your father had signed them.
I just didn't get to it in time.
Your stepmother asked me To have these faxed over to the box office.
So if you adopt me Then I'm your guardian.
Give me a pen.
Just to be clear, this doesn't make us family, just even.
At do you think you're doing? You can't sign anything without my consent.
Not anymore.
I'm sending you back where you belong.
You just lost the company.
Sticks and stones may break bones, But a poison pen is the best revenge.
I was just coming to find you.
Inviting me to a closed restaurant for dinner? Telling me the curtain is 8:00 and not 7:00? I just wanted to teach you a lesson, So you knew who was in charge around here.
That's not the way it works.
I'm the teacher, not you.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going home.
I was on my way to find you and apologize.
"on your way" an hour later? I feel terrible.
I do.
And As much as I wish I wasn't, I'm still learning.
It's like you not inflating your grades.
I can't not act out against people.
But I'm trying.
So Please forgive me.
I accept your apology.
Come.
Let's see if we can find you another ticket.
I'acactual quite tired.
I'll just see you monday? Yes, of course.
Thank you again.
Headmistress? Rachel? I'm sorry to bother you.
I just need to talk to you about something.
I hate losing.
You didn't lose.
Mm-hmm.
You just admitted defeat.
You know what's great about a box? Hmm? When the opera gets boring What do you think you're doing? I should ask you the same thing.
It's what bart wanted.
I'm sorry.
So you say.
I'm not so sure.
I'm not scared of you, jack.
You should be.
You're high and you're not thinking clearly.
You need to think About the repercussions of what you're doing.
I don't think I do.
I just had a full conversation with this opera-goer About "the magic flute.
" And he pretended like that was exactly what he just watched.
I'm beginning to get these society people.
It's all a big game Of pretending like you know what you're talking about.
Mm.
Where's lily? I don't know.
I haven't seen her all intermission.
Keep an eye out for her, huh? All right.
Chuck.
As much as I hate to ask you anything, have you seen lily? My dad's looking for her.
She said she was going to the powder room.
But that was a while ago.
What's going on here? What are you doing? Why is this door locked? You think you can squeeze me out, take away my power?! I worked for this! I earned it! Jack, it's over.
Stop it! You can't do this! Get off me! I can't? Who in this town wouldn't believe that the whore Didn't ask for it?! Stop! Please! Hey! Get off her! You stupid kid.
Oh, rufus! Oh, my god.
Lily! Come on.
Get off of me! Oh, my god.
Thank you.
My hair is terrible Nothing is I did want If you care about your hair, You're more a part of my world than ever.
You sure you're okay? Yes.
Yes, I am.
I'll see you later.
I heard from the board that jack is on his way back to sydney.
You didn't press charges.
No, I just wanted him gone.
But now I'm the, uh, interim head of bass industries, Believe it or not.
Is that why you called me here? What you did for me last night-- lily It's okay.
You don't have to feel the same way.
But I do have faith that when you're ready, You will do wonders With bass industries.
What are you talking about? On your 18th birthday, I want you to have everything.
I don't want this job or the corporate jet Or anything related to this business.
Just you, As a part of my family.
Look I know what happened to my father was an accident.
It was a terrible accident.
And, um If the offer still stands I'd like to move back in.
I would love that.
The thing about new beginnings Is that they require something else to end.
Hey! I'm just on my way out.
Miss blair, we must go or we be late.
The headmistress asked if I could come meet her at school.
I figured she wants to have tea Like we did when I first applied to yale.
What are you doing? I'm just reading the brown catalogue.
Oh, and I ordered a home dreadlocking kit.
Wanna meet up later? Definitely.
Maybe we can get a jump start on your veganism.
Have some celebratory seitan at angelica kitchen? Mm, I can't think of anything better.
Or grosser.
I'll call you after.
Okay.
Some endings take a long time to reveal themselves.
But when they do, they're almost too easy to ignore.
Hey, ms.
Carr.
What are you doing here? Rachel.
And I'm taking your advice to come out to brooklyn sometime.
Can i--can I get you anything? I make a mean cappuccino.
Well, all I have to do is press "start, " but I like to pretend.
That sounds great.
Yeah Here, sit.
Some beginnings start so quietly, You don't even notice they're happening.
So you've been on the subway now.
You've made it out to a borough.
How's the city working out for ya? I think I'm getting the hang of it.
Like anything else, you just have to make it work for you.
But most endings come when you least expect them, And what they portend Is darker than you've ever imagined.
I called you here this morning Because ms.
Carr told me what you did.
You leave me no choice but to give you detention.
Yale has been notified.
Your acceptance has been placed on hold.
If you complete detention to my satisfaction, Yale will still be possible.
But if you do not Put that puppy down, dorota.
What happened, miss blair? It's what's going to happen that you should be worried about.
Not all beginnings are cause for celebration.
A lot of bad things begin-- fight, flu season, And the worst thing of all Uh-oh.
Is it war? Yes.
But this one will be different.
I need to wait for my moment, and then I'm going black ops-- Off the radar, no accountability.
This war, I'm gonna win.
Wanna be starting somethin'.

This is my boyfriend dan humphrey.
Dan, this is miss carr.
She's my favorite new teacher.
What are you doing here? I'm taking your advice to come out to brooklyn sometime.
Why would you turn down yale? Yeah.
Why why would you do that? Brown is just a better fit for me, dan.
Do we still fit? This is a "b.
" Second semester seniors get a free pass.
You want to get rachel back for the grade she gave you? I can't risk not getting into yale.
I just wanted to teach you a lesson.
Inviting me to a closed restaurant for dinner? Ms.
Carr told me what you did.
If you complete detention to my satisfaction, yale will still be possible.
Is it war? Yes but this one will be different.
And who am i? That's a secret i'll never tell.

While upper east siders are hitting the snooze button, blair waldorf had a rude awakening when the rooster crowed at dawn this morning.
Never in my 16,982 hours of schooling have i ever been sentenced to detention.
I can't believe you added up all the hours of class we've had.
Makes me wanna play hooky.
One month with ms.
Carr, and i'm serving a week of hard time.
Dorota! Hey, be more thorough! Well, i think you might've had a little something to do with that.
The opera? The boathouse? Ring a bell? Look, all i know is i've never had a teacher who's actually taken me seriously.
It feels like she really gets me.
Is is that weird? Looks like humphrey has some competition.
Well, dan and i have barely spoken all week.
They say conversation is the first thing to go.
We will talk.
There's just a lot going on right now.
.
look, b.
, i gotta go.
I know where rachel eats breakfast, and i have to drop off my extra credit essay before i go to school.
I'll see you there.
Serena's sympathetic to the enemy.
I have to cross her off my list of recruits.
Give me that, quick! Come on! Quick! Yeah? Daddy! What a nice surprise! Handsome and i thought we'd bring you some breakfast.
Thank you.
Ahh.
You know, blair bear, i'm proud of you.
You're handling your punishment with such grace.
Well, we waldorfs are nothing if not graceful.
I wish you'd let me speak to the school.
It sounds like this teacher's been after you from the start.
Thank you.
But i wanted to handle this on my own.
That speaks volumes of the mature young lady you've become.
I wish everyone could see me through your eyes.
You keep your chin up.
I'll see you after school.
Bye-bye.
Miss blair, your martyr act no good.
Pick up the pace, shall we? I have to say, dan, i like this story even more than the last one you showed me.
I can totally relate to the sense of isolation, feeling like an outsider.
An outsider? You? Well, you know what? It took me ten years to master the local-express-local switchback.
And this morning? Gotta say you rose the subway like a native.
Do any other constance/ st.
Jude's students ever take the subway? Uh, no.
Most of them have limos with drivers.
And overbearing parents, overbooked schedules and overflowing bank accounts.
And a distracting sense of self-absorption.
School is the last thing on their minds, which is why i've been talking to headmistress queller about some ideas i have to get the students more focused on learning.
Oh, really? What do you have planned? Well rachel.
Dan.
Hi, serena.
Hey.
You guys are hanging out? Yeah, well, rachel has been giving me, uh, some feedback on my stories.
And by "feedback," he means "a wall of praise.
" Dan is a really good writer.
Trust me, i know.
Okay, all right, now i gotta go.
So see ya at school.
Is that your "king lear" essay? Dan has this amazing cordelia reference in one of his stories.
Oh, um, i was wondering, can i have a little bit more time? Uh, sure.
Hey.
Nathaniel, did we speak last night? No.
Why? What's up? I'm not sure, but i think last night may have been the greatest night of my life.
Really? What are you doing right now? I'm waiting for vanessa.
Why? Write down this address.
Blair.
If i'm correct, you completed your detention this morning.
Yes, ms.
Carr.
Signed and dated by the preservation society.
I hope the experience was educational.
I made friends with a family of squirrels and had lots of time to think.
Oh.
Henry david thoreau found nature inspiring as well.
I'll see you in class.
Girls, now that my days of community service are behind me, time for a takedown.
Hello? Do you need a refresher? I say.
You do.
To be honest, blair, none of us are that into I think we're gonna sit this one out.
Excuse me? B.
, why are you doing this? Queller will tell yale you're finished with detention, and it's over.
This is madness.
No! This is constance! Don't you see? If cornflower mary can come in here and tell us how to run things, then everything we've stood for, for all these years, is nothing.
This isn't about yale.
This is about our legacy.
What we do here today echoes through eternity.
Who's with me? Sorry, b.
This is your vendetta.
Students! Pay attention! What is this? New school policy there will be no cell phone usage during school hours.
Quiet, please.
Every morning before you enter the building, you will check your phones.
Is this a joke? I feel nauseous.
Somebody pinch me.
I'm in my own worst nightmare.
Who could be behind such pure evil? Well, well, well.
Now you with me? What do you want us to do? Every great leader knows you don't send your girls into the field unarmed.
If we know blair waldorf, munitions are on their way.
She's been like this for the past hour.
I think it's withdrawal.
She hasn't checked "gossip girl" in an hour and a half.
Is is a scandal still a scandal if you you can't text about it? That's very zen.
Did anyone see you? No, miss blair.
And you have what i asked for? Thank you, jesus.
No.
Thank you, blair.
And thank you, dorota.
Please, i need to check the dow.
Hey! Nelly yuki, get a grip! Girls these phones are our ammo.
I want you to dig deep and i mean deep into rachel's past.
We're gonna run that commie cornhusker straight out of constance.
Please tell me what we're doing here.
Yeah, and talk about the filthy rich w-what happened to you? Yesterday, i received an envelope.
Inside was a business card with an address, a date and a time on it.
No name.
I assumed it was some overly designed invitation to a business meeting.
When i arrived at the address, it was something different entirely.
A high-stakes poker game? Or an arms dealer auction? The ultimate private gentleman's club.
I walked through this door, and it was the chuck bass version of narnia? She was the most beautiful woman i've ever seen.
It's like she was waiting for me ready to serve knowing my every desire okay, we don't need details.
Sadly, i'm pretty sure that's as far as it went.
I woke up alone in a hotel room.
In a cruel twist of fate, i don't even remember her name.
Well, what exactly do you remember? Not a lot.
I'm hoping coming here will change that.
Between milking cows in des moines and teaching low income kids to read and write, ms.
Carr is clean as a whistle.
Seriously, she's the midwestern mother theresa.
Impossible, hazel.
Your methods of inquiry must be as tired as your hair.
We searched everywhere.
My fingers are raw.
When the truth fails you, you have no choice but to abandon it.
Make something up idiots.
With friends like these, who needs friends? Oh, i'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay? Yeah, no, i'm fine.
It's just a file folder.
It's not a brick wall.
I meant before that.
You didn't even notice me until you nearly knocked me over.
No, no, no.
No, i noticed you.
Uh, i was just actually thinking how much i like your sweater.
Thanks.
Not that i didn't like what you were wearing yesterday or that i even remember a-a yellow sweater and, uh, those shoe/boot things.
Dan? Yeah.
Breathe.
Right.
Oxygen it's good for the brain.
Uh, yeah, i ladies, you can give your tiny brains a rest.
Once again, the world has proven anything you can do, i can do better.
Sorry about that.
It's okay.
I'm sure you're on your way to class or it no, i'm just ms.
Carr and dan humphrey? Are they really? Who cares? But i have a friend in cyberspace who'll know just what to do.
X-o-x-o.
Oh, good job, man.
Way to go.
What? Yeah, dude.
Hey, this day is getting weirder by the minute.
Anything you want to tell me? Uh, besides i'm glad you're not wearing that raccoon makeup anymore? 'cause you looked like one of the incredibles.
Oh, thanks a lot.
And i thought i was the bad seed in the family.
What? Wha all right, what's going on? "Is is lonely boy giving a certain new teacher more than just an apple?" What does that mean, and and why is it written on your hand? 'cause nelly yuki wouldn't give me her contraband phone to show you myself.
I mean, this is just the headline.
The whole post would've gone all the way up my arm.
It was quite detailed about you and ms.
Carr and your forbidden love.
M-me and ms.
Carr? What? No.
That's absurd.
That is absurd.
Well, i'm not the one you need to convince.
I will see you later.
Dan, tell me this is not true.
Do you really need to ask? If there's something you need to say, then say it now.
No, there's not.
There's not, i swear.
I have no idea who sent that text or why.
Okay.
I'm sorry i doubted you.
Just things were so weird between us this morning, and then this i don't know.
I guess i was just confused.
Yeah, i'm right there with you.
Who why would someone want to do this? I mean, i thought everyone loved rachel.
Well, i do know someone who's not exactly her biggest fan.
Blair got trash duty in central park because of her.
If blair did this to rachel, this i mean, she's gone way too far.
So the ultimate gentlemen's club was here? Because this place reminds me of my aunt's house.
This was the place.
I knew it.
There were velvet curtains blocking this hallway.
There were women wearing masks, lying on a divan right where this piano is.
All right, listen, maybe you should get some rest.
It could help jog your memory.
Or warm ginger ale.
It's a miracle hangover cure.
This is her.
This is the woman.
Let me see.
No way.
The mom? This must be her house.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
The ladies' room? I knew you and serena were having problems.
I had no clue they were anatomical.
The only reason i'm trespassing on sacred ground is because i know you sent that rumor to "gossip girl.
" Sorry.
No idea what you're talking about.
You can go now.
Look, whatever issues you have with rachel, she cares about people.
She cares about her job.
Oh that is so sweet.
Maybe you should write a short story about it and have rachel give you notes naked.
I'm just all right, okay.
All right.
Hey.
I'm i'm sorry i didn't give this to you earlier.
I know it's silly, but the reason is, um, well, dan he's so confident in his writing that i i don't know.
I was just a little intimidated.
Dan's talented, but his confidence comes from a lifetime of encouragement and praise.
I'm guessing, for you, birthdays rarely meant new pens and a notebook to fill with your ideas.
Yeah, more like a chanel wallet and a credit card to get me out of the house.
Thank you.
Oh, my god, that's ms.
Carr.
It's like i have spinach in my teeth or something.
And i don't.
I even went to the bathroom to check.
Yeah, it's actually not spinach.
Um, it's a rumor a pretty ugly one about you and dan.
But i know it's not true.
A rumor about me and dan.
I've been at this school long enough to know what that means.
Unbelievable.
Yeah, well, don't worry.
I've been on "gossip girl" plenty of times, and for the worst things.
Some of them were true, some of them weren't.
But eventually, everyone forgets.
The best thing to do with these things is just nothing at all.
"Gossip girl"?
Oh, yeah, it's, um, it's a web site where a girl posts gossip.
Well, at least we think it's a girl.
And where does she get her tips?
Um, it's anonymous, so no one really knows.
But i gotta get to class.
Hey, rachel.
You got a minute? Yeah.
It is a great piece of property.
I'm surprised anyone would want to sell.
The husband finally caved, agreed to a greenwich commute.
Husband.
Mm-hmm.
The woman with the baby in the picture i just assumed the nanny.
I thought prospective buyers would like that photo.
The nanny.
Of course.
Look, there's some, uh, questions i'd like to ask the owners.
Nothing serious.
Noise, neighbors, that sort of thing.
I'll do my best to answer them, but i can't give out a client's personal information.
It's policy.
Of course.
I understand.
But i'm sure you know what the bass name means in real estate.
If you were to help me, maybe you'd allow me to extend the same professional courtesy to you in the future? Well, i could never do anything unprofessional.
But sometimes i do leave a file unattended when i go to get a drink.
There's some bottled water in the fridge.
Are you thirsty?
Parched.
Hello? Yes, is this the philips residence? Yes.
I hope i'm not disturbing you.
I was wondering if i could speak with your nanny, please.
I'm sorry.
Elle's with the children at the park.
Can i take a message? Elle.
We met last night in manhattan.
I just wanted to thank her for a lovely evening.
That's impossible.
Elle was here in greenwich last night watching the children.
You're sure? Absolutely.
Could could i leave a message, please? Can you tell her chuck bass called? My number is 646 i was told you wanted to see me, headmistress queller? Miss waldorf, please have a seat.
This school has been aware of the "gossip girl" web site for some time.
Up until now, the content has focused on the students.
The students haven't complained, so we've turned a blind eye.
However, now that a teacher has become involved, i have no choice but to deal with it.
I'm sorry.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Blair.
I know you posted the rumor about me.
Whatever rumor you're talking about, i had nothing to do with it.
I find this accusation preposterous.
Ms.
Temmel, would you please send the student in? Thank you.
Someone came forward and identified you as the source.
Let me guess dan humphrey? This information was then confirmed by a witness.
If i don't go ivy league, my dad will kill me.
It was my record or yours.
We tried to tell you something like this would happen, but you just wouldn't listen.
I'm sorry, blair.
Blair, your actions threatened the reputation of the entire teaching staff and this school.
You give me no choice but to ask you to leave constance billard.
You're expelling me? Headmistress queller is standing firm on the expulsion.
Yale will revoke my acceptance as soon as they receive word.
This is my darkest hour.
Blair, if you started that rumor about dan humphrey and the teacher, she has a legitimate case for slander.
I need to know.
Did you? I might've posted something on "gossip girl.
" All the girls do it.
It's how we communicate.
But anything i wrote was the truth.
I didn't lie.
I promise, daddy.
All right.
Then you should've been honest with the headmistress about that.
But the real issue here is not teenagers gossiping online.
It's not? No, it's that a teacher is having an inappropriate relationship with a student.
I'm going to contact my lawyers.
We're gonna fight this.
Fight it? Oh, i don't you will not be punished for telling the truth.
Thank you, daddy.
So you ratted on blair? You templeton.
A "charlotte's web"-sult? That's very cute.
And, no, technically, i did not rat on blair.
I just told rachel to put the squeeze on the weakest of her kilted cronies.
And what does serena think of you getting her best friend expelled? The moment blair involves me in her schemes, the "boyfriend of the b.
f.
f.
" Clause is officially null and void.
So she brought it on herself.
The alleged online slander incident? What? You, um you heard about the rumor? You gave it a name? Well, the parents' council called an emergency meeting tonight.
Apparently, my son is the object of the slander, assuming that it is slander you and ms.
Carr.
A package for vanessa abrams.
Saved by the bell.
Dan, if i'm gonna walk into a room full of fired-up parents, i need to know.
Is there something we need to talk about? I'm gonna go file this.
No, there's no, there's nothing to talk about.
My tea is getting cold.
Hey, thanks for meeting me.
I brought these to keep us warm.
Oh, thanks.
After everything that's gone on this week, i feel safer meeting outside.
We can talk freely.
I swept the perimeter for bugs.
Ms.
Carr, i understand that you're upset with blair.
What she did was wrong.
But does her punishment have to be expulsion? It means she'll lose yale.
Do you think this is a step i wanted to take? I feel terrible, but blair posted a rumor that threatened to destroy my career, my future.
And getting expelled destroys blaire's future.
Please just talk to headmistress queller and ask her to reconsider.
"Gossip girl" is just a stupid web site.
How can you say that, when its sole purpose is to allow people to post terrible things about each other? I'm not defending "gossip girl.
" I'm defending my best friend.
Believe me, serena, i'm sorry this all happened.
But i have to go.
I have an appointment before the parents' meeting.
I do hope we can still be friends.
Hello? Hey.
Hey, i-i really thought that rachel would come around, but i'm sorry, b.
Dorota.
Blair? Blair? Give handsome to a homeless man.
Make sure he has kind eyes.
I'm not going to yale.
I don't deserve you.
Okay, i'm back.
Just hang in there, okay? We'll figure something out.
I can't believe we're all here on a saturday night.
That's a lot of canceled restaurant reservations.
Well, you expel one yale-bound senior, it gets people's attention.
Harold, how are you? Lily.
Mwah.
I'm hoping that i can count on your support tonight.
Blair is being horribly scapegoated.
I thought the meeting was to discuss the school's new online honor codes.
Yes, well, i'm crashing it to advocate for my daughter.
Harold waldorf.
Well, i'm here to make sure no other students are slandered the way my son was by your daughter.
Rufus humphrey.
Okay, we'll see you inside, harold.
Nathaniel.
Hey, what's going on? Now you're not still thinking about that girl, are you? Her name is elle.
And if you must know, i'm late for my chiropractor.
She's double-jointed.
Makes the "kama sutra" feel new again.
Nice to see you're moving on.
Call me tomorrow, all right? I just wanted to thank you for yesterday.
I don't have any friends in the city, and telling me about blair, you really acted like one.
Oh, anytime.
And, you know, if you ever need a-a character witness to vouch for how fantastic you are, uh, i'm your guy.
That's sweet.
Thank you.
A character witness.
Do you know it may have come to that? I'm sorry.
I didn't i didn't mean to upset you.
No, i'm sorry.
I'm overwhelmed.
And this rumor is just so insulting.
An affair with a student? Me and you? I would n-never do that.
Never? W-wow, that's definitive.
Please, don't take it personally.
I mean no, no.
If you were older or not a student at the brother school.
You can call me in five years.
Here.
Here.
Uh, dan no, i'm i'm sorry.
I just no, i i know.
Um, it's not appropriate.
Uh, i'm late.
Spotted lonely boy going from teacher's pet to persona non grata in the pitter-patter of a heartbeat.
That invitation wasn't for you.
You were never supposed to be at that party.
What do you remember? All i remember is you.
That's not what i was referring to.
I can't remember anything else.
Why don't you fill me in? I wasn't at that party to meet you.
I was there for another man.
Who? Your father.
My father? My father is i know that now.
I took over a girl's client list.
I sent the invitation without realizing.
When you told me your name was chuck, i realized that i had the wrong mr.
Bass.
I had to get you out of there.
I had to make sure that you didn't remember anything that you saw.
The drink so you drugged me and then snuck back to connecticut? What matters is that i left you at that hotel to keep you safe.
Safe from what? Hey, look the whole "eyes wide shut" mystery has been fun.
But if my father was part of this group, i have a right to know who they are.
Turn on cnn.
Walk down wall street.
Go to washington.
That's who they are.
And if they find out that i let an outsider in lose the card, the stamp on your arm will fade, and stop asking questions.
Stop looking.
I'll protect you.
How? Your own father was one of them, and you didn't even know it.
Don't contact me again.
A courier delivered this to me this morning.
Do i need a password? The password is newport.
Mm.
'cause that's where my mom is tonight.
Mm.
Turns out i can still apply to oberlin.
The face, serena.
Try to pretend it's not totally tragic.
You were right about dan and rachel.
Seriously? I must've picked up on something.
We need proof.
You have proof? Give it to me.
Dan said that nothing was going on, so i should probably just talk to him first.
And give him another opportunity to lie to you? How awful.
I'm so sorry, s.
But this is the smoking gun i've been waiting for.
Blair.
We have to get to that meeting.
dorota! - yes, miss blair.
Go get my dog back! Come on.
This is a freedom of speech issue.
The school cannot control what our children write on a public site.
What your daughter posted was slander.
She should be held accountable.
If slander's the issue, we can seek an injunction against "gossip girl.
" Shut the site down.
Shut it down? Yes, and a hundred others will pop up in its place.
This isn't some note on the bathroom wall, lil.
It's on the internet that dan slept with a teacher.
That's wrong.
I agree.
But should blair lose yale over this? It's her whole future, rufus.
Well, what about dan's future? How long is this gonna follow him? Miss waldorf, this meeting is closed to students.
I'm sorry for the interruption.
But i have something i think almost everyone here would want to see.
Headmistress, if you'd like to check your e-mail i believe it's called exculpatory evidence.
I love "damages.
" Hey.
I'm here.
What's going on? If you wanted to break up with me, you could've just said so.
I trusted you, and you lied to me both of you.
Whoa.
Wh-what? No, i saw you and rachel in the coffee shop.
Well, yeah, rachel was upset, and i comforted her.
I probably shouldn't have, because she pulled away, but wait.
Y-you didn't kiss her? No, no, no, i didn't kiss her.
Why would you think that? Because it looked like oh, god.
I i took a photo and then i left, because i didn't want to see anymore.
Wait a minute.
Oh, my god.
Okay, uh, well, y-you can't show this to anyone.
I gave it to blair.
Sh-she's in there with queller and the parents and and rachel, too.
Dad.
Dad, it's not true.
Dan, you and i will talk at home.
They fired me.
I'm back in.
I saved myself and "gossip girl.
" You used this photo of rachel and me to back up a rumor that is nothing more than a vengeful lie.
So? Blair, unh-unh.
You say "lie.
" I say "eerily prophetic.
" Blair? Daddy.
I was going to congratulate you.
The driver will take you home.
I need some fresh air.
Daddy, please.
Look, i get why blair went after rachel, but why why you? Well, i felt like a fool.
I thought you lied to me.
Well, i told you nothing was going on.
I know.
So why were you so ready to believe the worst? Honestly i think part of me wanted to.
Dan we keep trying to act like we can overcome anything.
Yeah, pretending that none of it mattered.
Our parents dating, sharing a brother i mean, different colleges next year, it's wow.
It's over, isn't it? Well, we had to try.
Yeah.
Sometimes the only thing left to do is to wrap your arms around each other one last time and then just let go.
Lily told me about you and serena.
Are you okay? I'm i'm okay about serena.
What happened in the meeting? Well, once the parents saw the photo of you and ms.
Carr, her fate was pretty much sealed.
Rachel didn't do anything.
No, i-i'm the one who screwed up.
Look, i believe the two of you weren't having an affair.
But meeting a student, one she didn't even teach, off-hours, after school you voted to fire her, didn't you? You just got into yale.
I was protecting your future.
By firing someone that didn't do anything wrong? You know, you talk about these park avenue parents who shield their kids from punishment.
Well, i should be punished, not her.
It's over, dan.
Let it go.
You left this at the park.
That's why i went to the coffee shop yesterday.
The coffee shop? I'm the one that took the photo and gave it to blair.
You're the only teacher that's ever expressed any interest in me, and i've completely ruined it.
Your essay.
I read it last night.
It was wonderful, filled with nuanced observations about the world around you.
Huh.
There's some unexpected irony.
Rachel, i'm really sorry.
Serena i think you should go.
You'll frolic in the vineyards, play boules with old men.
Roman got you a chanel beret.
Do you really have to take him with you? Well, how was i to know when i asked your mother if we could get you a bulldog that she assumed we meant a stuffed animal? Blair i'm worried about you.
Why? I'm back at constance.
I got into yale.
Everything's perfect again.
I saw a different side of you last night, and i'm disappointed.
But, daddy, i was right.
No, you were lucky.
And you allowed me to defend a lie a lie that you looked me in the eyes and told.
Why did you do that? Yale was on the line.
I have to go there, like you.
It's our plan.
Sweetheart, what matters most to me is not which college you go to.
It's what kind of a person you grow up to be.
Why don't i take you and handsome to the airport? Dorota can make a picnic, and we eat it in the car.
No.
I think we should just say good-bye now.
I'll call you as soon as i land.
We both have a lot to think about.
They say every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
And once something is set in motion, it can't help but build momentum.
Father, what were you involved in? Elle? No, it's alan philips.
Elle called us from grand central last night, but she never got off the train in greenwich.
Have you heard from her? Um, no.
Uh, but i'll let you know if i do.
We're very worried.
I'd appreciate it.
Uh, what are you doing here? I, uh, i came to apologize.
That rumor would've gone away.
But but that hug was just totally stupid and and and wildly inappropriate, and i don't know what came over me.
"With a heavy heart rachel, what are you doing? I don't teach at constance anymore.
What about her conduct? The photograph? The board of directors is concerned we don't have sufficient evidence.
And dan himself said there was nothing going on between them.
Ms.
Carr could sue the school for wrongful termination, and no one wants that kind of publicity.
So what does this mean? Ms.
Carr will be able to resume her duties and see out the semester.
I know a few parents won't be happy, but they have to understand it's for the greater good.
A scandal would hurt everyone.
I'm going to notify ms.
Carr right now.
I thought as head of the parents' council, you'd like to know.
Hey, dan, it's me.
I went to rachel to apologize, but i'm not sure it did any good.
I'm really sorry about everything.
I guess i'll just see you at school tomorrow.
And maybe we can forget this whole rachel thing ever happened.
One thing is certain on the upper east side what goes around, comes around.
X.
o.
x.
o.
, gossip girl.
You were right about dan and rachel.
You have proof.
give it to me.
If they find out that I let an outsider in I'll protect you.
Your own father was one of them and you didn't even know it.
Don't contact me again.
I'm sorry for the interruption, But I have something I think almost everyone here would want to see.
I'm back at constance, got into yale.
Everything's perfect again.
I thought you lied to me.
Then why were you so ready to believe the worst? I think part of me wanted to.
It's over, isn't it?- what are you doing here? I came to apologize.
I don't know what came over me.
On the upper east side, All the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players.
But once a year, constance/ st.
Jude's students shed their usual roles and Take on new ones for the senior class play.
This year's pick-- "the age of innocence.
" I just can't believe this is a senior requirement or that Chuck got a doctor to actually diagnose him with acute stage fright.
Should have gone with mercury poisoning.
Before "gossip girl," there was edith wharton, And how little has changed.
The same society snobs still reigned, Only in corsets and horse-drawn carriages.
When I saw "the age of innocence" with daddy, I always pictured myself as winona, But playing the stronger, More emotionally complex female lead Just feels so right.
Dorota, hairpin.
Besides, you're so much more suited to play may, who's so pretty.
Uh, thanks.
At last, my life is perfect.
My only problem-- how to relate to my character.
Countess olenska is a ruined woman With no prospects, And let's face itI have the world on a string.
Of course, there is the odious task of playing opposite dan humphrey.
Dorota, enough.
how are you two doing, b.
t.
w? I don't know.
I'm just trying not to think of him, distracting myself with other Distractions.
You mean your crush on our director? Julian is kind of amazing, isn't he? - Do you know that he directed - bogosian off-broadway In his last year of juilliard, blah, blah, blah? You can always depend on constance to snare some wunderkind.
But really, s.
, aren't you sick of brooding artists? Well, he broods in the sexiest way, that is, When he's not looking right through me.
Oh, my life is so bountiful.
I don't need a boyfriend to feel fulfilled.
Aah! oh, my god! come look at this! But I do need silence to emotionally prepare for the stage.
What are you clucking about? Nelly just got in early to yale.
Uh, that's impossible.
Yale only accepts one constance student early a year, and that's me.
She just got an e-mail directly from dean berube.
I have to find headmistress queller.
Julian, I added the fur collar to olenska's act two dress.
Add fur to the cuffs.
humphrey! This is an invited dress.
backstage now.
I can't believe I volunteered to do costumes.
Oh, for the days of eleanor's atelier.
Wait.
did I really just say that? How did she even show her face after everthing she's done.
Dan, remember, in scene three, you enter from stage right, not stage left.
Stage left, right.
No.
no, stage right.
yeah, I got it.
I just don't get why you want to do a documentary on all this.
Are you kidding? A high school forks out a small fortune to stage a play okay.
Hires broadway's hottest up-and-coming director-- That means you've got wealth, privilege, atrocious acting.
And the fact that you're doing "the age of innocence," - Well, that's just the icing on the cake.
okay.
But don't worry.
I won't make you look bad.
stop.
And whatever else, "the age of innocence" is one of the most beautiful books ever.
ugh.
It's, like, the most boring book ever.
Nothing happens.
Guy and girl want to be together, but can't, end of story.
Nate, the story's in the details.
The simple act of unbuttoning a glove expresses the character's Inner passion.
I can think of a lot more interesting ways to express my passion.
Oh, really? - towards you.
Chuck bass.
it's good to see you, son.
Mr.
campbell, hello.
I, uh, I'm sorry for your loss.
I was in prague for the funeral.
I would have paid my respects in person.
Thank you.
I'll come by the office.
I hear you're learning the ropes.
Trying to.
Enjoy.
thanks.
Is this okay?- perfect.
My lucky day.
carter baizen back in town.
A delight to see you, bass.
Elle? you're all right.
You have the wrong person.
my name is hayley.
What are you doing with this loser? Back off, bass.
the, uh, lady says she doesn't know you.
She knows me.
I know you're in some kind of trouble.
Whatever kind of help you need, You're not going to find it with him.
Carter, I have to use the ladies' room.
Get me a drink? just--just wait a sec.
Come on, bass.
don't cause a scene.
Heard you were in thailand recently.
Of course I had to leave in a hurry.
You should have come to see me in singapore.
How was singapore? I'm surprised you made it out in one piece.
I'm hooked up on every continent.
I landed last night, rrolled into apothe and met Well, who really cares what her name is, right? - God bless america.
mr.
baizen? Your date just exited through the kitchen.
Welcome home.
Hey.
jacket over vest and button to top.
Hello? what's wrong with you? Oh, um, no, it's--it's nothing.
Did you see how those teachers treated rachel? Yeah.
they were like grown-up mean girls.
If I wrote a note, could you deliver it? Dan, headmistress queller told her to stay away from you.
I saw how they were treating her.
it's--it's--it's my fault.
I just want to know that she's okay.
Hi, miss carr.
I love your necklace.
is it new? Uh, no.
it's quite old, actually.
Well, it's very nice.
Hi.
I am gonna sit in front until the first costume change.
Jenny, i-i really don't think that Thanks.
This is just a dress rehearsal.
There are people out there.
don't let the-- headmistress! there you are.
Nelly yuki claimed she got into yale early.
There must be some mistake.
I'm sorry, blair.
there's no mistake.
I was on my way to tell you I received a call from dean berube.
They've rescinded your acceptance and given the spot to nelly.
Is today april fool's? Though I had previously informed yale of your detention, I did not tell them what the punishment was for.
But apparently, an anonymous caller did.
The dean called for me to confirm the story.
I had no choice.
But I did penance for that.
I explained that you made amends, But yale considers hazing a faculty member a very serious offense.
I'm sorry.
There must be something we can do.
Blair, it's over.
You will not be attending yale.
Every actress eventually finds the hook into her character, Even if sometimes life has to give her a little push.
Waldorf, you're holding up the curtain.
Come.
now.
Upon my soul, it's countess olenska, parading herself at the opera.
It's a pity.
her life is finished.
But don't worry, b.
When god closes a door, he opens a play.
Elle.
I need your help.
Oh, did you tell my cousin ellen of our engagement? I hadn't had the chance.
oh, well, you mustn't.
she's been away so long.
Did I miss much? oh, no, just the first scene.
Hey, jenny, you dropped your Oh.
wait.
can i May knows as well as I do the real reason of her cousin staying away.
But I shall never let her see the least sign that I'm Conscious of there being a shadow on poor ellen olenska's reputation.
Get me out of this.
out of my way.
I need to make the fat lady sing.
Pull! - it's stuck.
No, leave it.
she'll need as much padding as possible.
What is your problem? My problem is a two-faced, four-eyed devious little snipe in a fat suit.
Did you really think you could rat me out to yale and get away with it? I don't know what you're talking about.
Everyone's jealous of me because my life is perfect, And you've always been the most jealous of all.
People aren't jealous of you, blair.
they hate you.
I didn't call yale, and good luck figuring out who did.
There are about a thousand people who would relish taking you down.
wanna hear the sickest scandal ever? Remember b.
's lord? It turns out he was giving the royal treatment to his own queen mother, And the worst part? B.
knew and ignored it.
How desperate can you be, b.
? No wonder yale dumped you.
who wants inbred legacies? Someone's out to get you, blair.
it's just not me.
Vanessa.
Julian.
hey, I made the adjustment you suggested in the garden scene.
Uh, yeah, yeah.
um, good show, sabrina.
So how does it feel to play may welland? Well, it feels like my character's rubbing off on me.
May's fiance pays no attention to her, and as for me Are you talking about julian? Well, the play opens tomorrow.
he's just distracted.
Julian, hey.
I was just thinking, It would be really helpful for my friend vanessa's Documentary to hear more about your vision for the show.
Why don't we all grab a bite to eat? I suppose it couldn't hurt to, uh, Give my actors a little more insight into my intentions.
Let me just grab my stuff.
I'll meet you in front.
Airing my dirty laundry to yale and sending the lord marcus "gossip girl" blast makes you officially my enemy number one.
I don't know what you're talking about, blair.
Honestly.
what are you doing with her? we hate her.
I don't hate her.
she's my friend, actually.
And you just need to calm down.
Calm down, serena? she got me axed from yale.
You're seriously taking her side? Fine.
But a word of advice-- she will be destroyed, And you don't want to become collateral damage.
Thank you.
I've been bathing like the french in restaurant bathrooms all week.
So you've been on the run.
You know, I wanted to contact you.
I felt like we had a connection.
but I was scared.
And carter? - I just met him.
He told me he was rich, so I thought he could help.
Please.
Look, no one is going to hurt you.
Are you kidding? You know the kind of people who are members.
They're powerful men, And the things I know about them could destroy their lives.
Nobody ever told me that once you're in, you're in for good.
If only I could just leave the country, Start over with a clean slate.
So that's what you'll do.
Money's not a problem.
We'll get you a new identity, a new passport.
How? I know a guy.
Thank you.
Just one question.
How do you feel about Brazil? Scorsese said that he considers "Age of Innocence" More violent than his films with guns and blood.
Marty's inspiration was "The Heiress.
" - William Wyler.
So you're a Wyler fan? Have you ever seen "Little Foxes"? Are you kidding? Serena made me see it, like, what, three times? She's obsessed with Bette Davis.
Yeah, Bette Davis.
I, um I love her eyes.
Her hair is harlow gold.
Hey, listen.
I'm gonna take off, okay? - I'll come with.
Oh, I was just gonna tell you my take on the play.
Yes, that's a great idea.
Don't go, please.
Nate, do you mind? No, no.
It's, uh, it's cool.
Listen I have Lines to practice anyway, so I'll go now.
So You know, uh, Nate's got the right idea.
I didn't realize how late it was.
Let me just grab the check.
Thank god.
Serena, I know you like him, but as your friend, Julian is the most self-absorbed, Pompous person I've ever met.
All he does is go on and on about classic movies, And it's totally annoying.
You were keeping up with him pretty good there.
Yeah, and I'm totally annoying.
Thanks, ladies.
Don't worry.
It's taken care of.
And, uh, it's been a lot of fun.
It has.
Uh, you know, All this talk about Bette Davis has--has Really got me thinking about my character.
You know, I think I could use some More coaching before the show.
What do you say? - Sure.
Say 4:00? Text me your address.
Great.
So what are you up to? - You mean, what are we up to? I may not be a huge classic film buff, But I have read "Cyrano.
" Hey.
Sorry.
When I finally came out, you were gone.
So You were great in the play.
I just-- No, I-I meant with Rachel.
Do you, like--did she respond? Uh, yeah.
She wrote a note.
All right, w-well, great.
Where is it? Um, dad has it.
Mr.
Humphrey-- - I believe this belongs to you.
Poor Miss Iowa-- caught playing Mrs.
Robinson.
Looks like the teacher just got schooled.
Dan, we need to talk.
Well, I've got nothing to say.
I went to see Miss Carr last night.
This thing between the two of you--it's over.
Well, we'll see.
You cannot be this short-sighted.
If word gets out about this, you'll be expelled.
Miss Carr will be fired for good.
Well, Miss Carr is the one who sent me the key.
So presumably, she understands that risk And she's making her own decision.
However grown-up you think you are, You're still in high school.
I care about Rachel, all right? And I'm 18.
So with all due respect, I think I'll decide who I see.
Oh, do go on, newland.
I do love your descriptions.
Well, why shouldn't we make them real? We shall, my dearest, of course, next year.
See, May is all about what's proper.
You've read other Wharton novels, right? "The House of Mirth"? Yes.
yes, I-I have.
Good, because "House of Mirth" Was a huge influence on clayton.
Jack Clayton.
He directed "the great gatsby.
" Jack Clayton, "Gatsby.
" Most critics consider it a failed adaptation.
No offense, Mr.
Film Fanatic, But I-I don't think the movie was nearly as good as the book.
I don't disagree.
Why do you say so? Some blame Clayton's direction, Others point the finger at Coppola's screenplay.
In "the times," vincent canby said-- - Whoa.
Slow down.
Excuse me? No excuse me.
It's just that sometimes my thoughts come so fast that I, uh, I get confused.
Sorry.
From now on, I'll say a line, And all you have to do is repeat it exactly.
You're quite right.
The film is impotent.
It totally misses what the book is even about-- The eternal conflict between the repression of Society and the passion of the individual.
You are so insightful, Julian.
I completely agree about the power of unexpressed passion.
You know, you are so insightful, Julian.
I completely agree about the power of unexpressed passion.
I have to confess, I underestimated you.
You're quite extraordinary.
Shall we get back to the scene? What was that? I'm sorry.
Just one second.
It's a text.
Yale's hallowed halls have gone to hell.
S.
got accepted, but not for her s.
a.
t.
scores.
Allowing a press release was her only prerequisite.
I have to go.
I-I lost track of time again.
We're late for the theater.
Are you ready to go? Yeah.
Yeah.
Good to see you, Hayley.
Or should I call you Elle? - sorry I ran off like that.
I just didn't know if I could trust you or not.
Baizen, you know I'm not your biggest fan, - But you are an expert at crossing borders.
I'm happy to oblige.
Especially if it means having Chuck Bass owe me a favor.
But my passport guy-- he's a bit of a paranoid freak.
He won't like an entourage.
I understand.
Look, you take Elle, and I'll meet you at Teterboro.
It's okay.
Thank you.
I'm so grateful.
Don't worry, Bass.
We'll take care of her.
I've lost everything.
I'm humiliated and shunned.
They've made me a flesh-and-blood countess olenska.
You are an actress.
Pour it into the role.
use pain onstage.
You're right.
I'm an actress.
no I'm a seagull.
No, you're a shameless bitch.
Now what? Everything you've done spreading rumors about who I've had s*x with, What alley I puked in Or telling Dean Berube that I killed pete fairman I forgave everything all because I thought one Day you'd grow up, but putting out a "gossip girl" blast about yale and the press release Serena, I didn't put out the blast.
At least have the dignity not to lie to my face.
wait.
but I'm not lying.
Only two people knew about it--you and Dan and dan would never do something like that.
I always want to believe the best in you, Blair.
The bottom line is, betrayal's in your nature.
I didn't do it, Dorota.
I believe you, miss Blair.
And if I didn't, that means Dan Humphrey did.
Vanessa told him about marcus, and he could've put that out, too, All to get back at me for teacher-gate.
Do you know how hard it is to get revenge When your enemy is changing every five minutes? You need to calm nerves and warm vocal chord.
you want tea? No, I want dan Humphrey's head on a platter.
Rachel, hey, hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
We have to talk.
no, no, dan.
we need to stay away from each other.
My dad showed up at your house.
We need to at least discuss this.
people are coming.
It was reckless of me to respond to your note.
Rachel What are we doing? I-i can't help myself.
Am I supposed to pretend I'm not feeling what I'm feeling? You know this can't last.
What can't? Our staying away from each other.
Oh, mother's carriage has arrived.
Do excuse me, dear.
of course.
So what happened with julian? We were in the middle of it, and then you just hung up.
oh, sorry.
I had to get off the phone.
But I shall never let her see the least signs that I am Conscious of there being a shadow on poor ellen olenska's reputation.
I'll explain later.
the next day, mrs.
Manson mingott received the young couple at a large House in an inaccessible wilderness in the central park.
Girl, bring me my fan.
Yes.
right away, ma'am.
Mr.
archer and miss welland.
At last.
I was beginning to think you were so besotted With love you'd forgotten about your old grandmother.
And when is the wedding to be? - Thank you for meeting me, mr.
campbell.
oh, it's my pleasure, Chuck.
Your father was one of my closest friends.
Which is why I was hoping you could help me with something.
My father was a member of a club.
Oh, I can get you off the waiting list at any place in town.
just name it.
I'm not talking racket sports.
this is a gentlemen's club.
As it happens, carter baizen is a member, too.
I'm not acquainted with mr.
baizen.
yesterday, park avenue winter? - You left right when he did.
I don't remember when I left.
And I don't know anything about a gentlemen's club.
The club moves every month.
There are girls there.
My.
my, my.
Well, Chuck I have no idea what you're talking about.
Someone I care about is in trouble, And this club has something to do with it.
Now knowing my father was a member, It only stands to reason that his closest friends were, too.
When I go to the authorities, I'll have to suggest they investigate everyone.
I'm sorry about your friend, but I don't know anything that could help.
Have a good evening.
Mr.
campbell, please.
I care about her.
I can't say anything.
Eastview Hotel 10:30p.
m.
The great uta hagen used to tell actors, "give birth to the new person you are to become.
" Well, with act one behind you and act two looming, my friends, You are still in labor.
I feel like I'm in labor.
Remember, being onstage Is like standing on the edge of a cliff.
What saves you is the love and trust you have in each other.
Also, my friend, the renowned "new york times" theater critic, Charles isherwood, is in the audience, and if you embarrass me, I will kill you.
now go.
Mr.
isherwood, thank you so much for coming.
Thank you.
Are you enjoying the show? - yes.
yes.
What happened to you? you were supposed to come by and get me.
I'm sorry.
You stood me up and your only explanation is "sorry"? Nate, what is going on? Nate, I told you.
Your character went bankrupt, suffered total public humiliation.
Not that you would understand that.
The characters in this play are smoldering tempests of emotion.
You're as empty as The federal reserve.
Nate, wait.
No.
I gotta go work on my smoldering tempest of emotion.
Don't you think that was a little harsh? Directors push buttons to get performances.
Put your camera on a tripod.
come watch the show.
what a pretty carriage.
Every time I see you, you happen to me all over again.
Ellen, you might be the most honest woman I've ever met.
What the hell are you doing? Oh, no, but one of the least fussy.
You're trying to ruin my life.
you're insane.
You must know that this can't last.
What can't? Our being together And not being together.
Don't try to gaslight me, humphrey.
I know you're just seeking revenge Because I ruined your chances with the simpy iowa Teacher.
And incredible as it may seem, not everyone spends their lives trying to plot revenge.
You ought not to have come today.
I look forward to seeing you.
Every thought is burnt up in a great flame.
Someone is out to get me, and all signs point to you.
You're the only one who knew it all.
it has to be you.
Six or seven days passed, and archer heard nothing from madam olenska.
Then one day, the newland archers received an invitation To dine at mrs.
Mingott's.
May, what a pretty gown.
Oh, thank you.
how are you feeling, granny? People tell me I'm old and ill, but I feel perfectly fine.
Hey.
here.
That charm will prove useful when "beu-fort" arrives.
I want him to feel welcomed.
uh, beau-beaufort.
Oh.
right.
beaufort.
Granny? My child, your beauty never wanes.
Ellen, it's been too long.
Much too long, cousin.
It was--it was really great of julian to let vanessa film it.
I guess she says he's an amazing director.
is that right? Nate, that's your cue.
go, go! okay.
sorry.
Beaufort, so, so good of you to come.
Uh, they say you've been abroad.
Well, yes.
I've--i've been, um I've been, um, you Uh, they--they say you've been abroad, right? Yes.
I've, um he's always had trouble with this line.
I You know what? whatever.
y-y-you want feelings? Well, i-i-i hate these clothes, I hate this play and I hate pretentious Asshats who try and steal other people's girlfriends.
In fact, I might just spontaneously punch one next time you get in my face.
I know just how mr.
Beaufort feels-- working so hard for something And losing it because people are out to destroy you.
Well, countess, At least you don't have to go through your whole life Worried your best friend will humiliate and betray you.
I hate this fat suit.
oh, and there's one other thing.
My whole family lost all of our money Before my father went to jail for embezzlement.
So I think I know more about humiliation andbankruptcy All right, all right.
than some lame dilettante director.
okay? Oh, what amusing companions.
no, stop.
Oh my god.
why don't we retire to the parlor, uh, for some port? No.
I'm damned with van der luyden.
all right.
Shakespeare says, "all's well that ends well," And then sometimes it just ends.
Nate had already ruined everything.
You high school idiots turned my play into a travesty, Embarrassed me professionally.
julian, it's charles isherwood.
Charles.
please, i-i can explain.
explain what? I loved it.
The classic interpretation of the first act juxtaposed with the radical Deconstruction of the second act--genius.
really? you--you thought it was genius? Yeah, I did.
The repressed characters melding with the actual kids Aggressively expressing their feelings-- how did you come up with it? well,as soon as I saw all that raw, adolescent emotion, I-i-i knew I had to use it, harness it, spin it into gold.
Well, congratulations.
I look forward to seeing what you do next.
G--that's great.
thank you for coming.
thanks.
Wow.
that was a whole new level of fake.
I'm going to look for my boyfriend.
good job.
You know, I don't know why I ever had a crush on you.
Serena I'm gay.
Nate, wh-- what happened up there? I know you're into him, and I get it.
I mean, he's older, he's smarter, and you guys like the same stuff.
I can't compete.
you what? I came to the gallery today and heard you on the phone.
Oh, my god.
are you talking about julian? I was talking to serena.
she was with him.
She's the one who likes him, not me.
This is a total misunderstanding.
Well, you know, that doesn't change the facts.
All right? I mean, we have nothing in common.
I like espn, okay, and you like Books and movies.
The way you say that You didn't even bother to read "age of innocence.
" You didn't watch the dvd I gave you.
You're like a kid who swears he hates Tomatoes and has never even tried one.
Maybe you should be with a guy like julian who already likes tomatoes.
Maybe if you would put in some effort, you wouldn't be so insecure.
Elle.
Chuck.
how did you-- escape? turns out they didn't want to hurt me.
They just wanted me to sign an agreement.
They gave me some cash and told me to get out of town.
that's great.
Sao paolo awaits.
Sao paolo? brazil.
I can still help you get settled, and we can make a plan together.
Chuck, I am really grateful that you were willing to help me, But all I needed was someone to give me money.
Now I have more than enough, and I've already made a plan By myself.
So you were just using me? You've got a good heart.
You should give it to somebody who cares.
Hi.
that was some performance.
It was nothing compared to yours.
what do you mean? You called yale, sent the blast in to "gossip girl" To get revenge on blair.
I believed in you.
All your talk about integrity and ideals.
My ideals? Blair spread false rumors, blackmailed the school, Turned my job into a sham with no repercussions.
You're just as bad as she is.
No, you're--you're worse.
Blair is a high schooler.
you're an adult.
You need to fix things with blair.
absolutely not.
You know how you felt when your ideals were crushed? Well, congratulations.
you've crushed mine.
Hey, blair.
It's--it's rachel who's been messing with you, And we had s*x in the costume closet, So you can do whatever you want with that.
Student s*x in the costume closet-- is That what they mean by heartland values? I at least expected a denial.
No.
I don't deny it.
Well, the headmistress told me my fate at yale is sealed.
So the question is, how do I make your fate as bleak as mine? I don't know what's happened to me.
I don't know what I've become.
I'm So sorry.
Well, your punishment is Just Live with it.
I should know.
It's not easy.
Serena.
So just so you know, Blair isn't responsible for--for sending out that blast about yale.
I am.
You? Yeah, well, I told rachel about yale wanting to put out the press release, And she sent it in to "gossip girl.
" but w-why would you do that? I was trying to explain to her that you aren't like the other Girls here and-- i-i gotta go find blair.
thank you for telling me.
I'm so sorry.
And I get it if you don't want to talk to me right now, but the fact is, I come bearing snacks, Hoping that we can cuddle on the couch and watch espn.
come here.
You're watching "the age of innocence"? It's heartbreaking.
So are you.
I am a way better beaufort.
I'm--i'm sorry.
I-i know you were just looking out for me.
And rachel--well, she, uh, She turned out to be not who I thought she was or at least not anymore.
I'm sorry, too, son.
Dad, you were right about this, but I think you Need to give me space to make my own mistakes.
Well Lucky for you, you'll be at yale soon.
You can make all the mistakes you want, with, god-willing, Girls your own age.
b.
, I've been looking everywhere for you.
I know that was rachel that sent the "gossip girl" blast.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
Why would you? What do you mean? Believe me.
Nine times out of ten, I would have sent the blast.
Like you said, betrayal's in my nature.
I didn't mean that.
Spare me, serena.
I don't need a stirring speech telling me what a good person I am.
I know I'm not.
Yale kicking me out is the karma I've earned.
Blair.
Could you please leave? I want to be alone.
You're still my best friend.
In life, as in art, some endings are bittersweet, Especially when it comes to love.
So I know I sucked at the role of messenger, but I found this by the door, So I thought I'd try again.
Thanks.
Dan, I am going back to iowa, as you must have known.
I am sorry for everything.
As edith wharton wrote, "there is no one as kind as you, "no one who gave me reasons I Understood for doing what at first seemed so hard.
" Thank you.
r.
Sometimes fate throws two lovers together, only to rip them apart.
Miss blair is out, mr.
chuck.
I'll wait.
Sometimes the hero finally makes the Right choice but the timing is all wrong.
And as they say, timing is everything.
Hello, beautiful.
Carter.
What are you doing here? Buying you a drink.
Looks like this story might just have a second act.
Let's hope it's not a tragedy.
X.
o.
x.
o.
, gossip girl.
gossip girl here, your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
Yale has rescinded your acceptance and given the spot to nelly.
Doesn't hurt nearly as bad as waking up that morning in santorini and finding you jumped on a boat.
That night wasn'exactly what I signed up for either.
When yto dominica,he could only get his hands on enough money to get himself set up.
Weon't have any money.
the van der bilts do.
But why would my grandparents pay us to go live with him why they can't even help us out here? Isn't it just breathtaking? mom,your art consultant has ent has exquisite taste.
You've got a good heart.
You should give it to somebody who cares.
Miss blair is out,mr.
Chuck.
I'll wait.
Carter,what are you doing here? Buying you a drink.
spring time on the upper east side, where the winter chill is supposed to be so last season.
But when mittens and scarves are still all the rage, the best thing you can do is just button up and hope for warmer days, and hope for warmer days ah,there's nothing like summer in the eastern bloc.
Just a eurail pass and a backpack full of failed socialist policies.
and nate.
The vienna state opera one day,ay,pierogies in poland the next.
No map,no reservations,just total freedom,and nate is super excited,too.
Probably not as excited as he is about our day of college basketball.
I know your mom's out of town,but if you came-- hey,guys.
Hey,this is my cousin tripp.
This is my girlfriend vanessa.
This is dan.
Dan.
Nice to meet you.
I'm trying to convince nate here to make an appearance at the family hoodoo this weekend-- lunch today,cocktail party tomorrow.
Hey,maureen will be there.
We're engaged now.
I didn't know that.
That's fantastic.
Yeah,well,you missed a lot.
Hey,why don't you drop by? Grandfather would love to see you,too.
You know,I appreciate it,tripp.
I do.
There's just a lot of stuff going on.
Okay,I can take a hint.
Call me if you change your mind,all right? I will.
I will.
Congratulations.
Thanks,man.
It was nice meeting you.
Bye.
Nice to meeting you,tripp.
You--you're gonna skip out on your family reunion? I appreciate the commitment to the game-- no,listen,man,I'm not gonna go pretend to bond with the people who shut me and my mom out when my dad got busted.
Let's go inside.
The game's starting.
hello,sweetheart.
Chuck,I have been looking for my phone all morning.
I was checking to see if blair changed her number.
Well,if she's not calling you back,you should probably take the hint.
I went to see her last week.
She never came home.
It's not like our girl to be out all night.
I know something's going on.
This is more than her having her dirty laundry aired on "gossip girl.
" She,um she got rejected by yale.
The only thing she wanted more than me.
That would be painful.
Chuck,she's embarrassed,so we just need to give her some time to lick her wounds.
Maybe I can lick them for her.
blair,hey,it's me.
Now here's an extraordi pry newiece I can get from a private collector-- I thought perhapsthfor e bedroom.
Oh,I agree.
It's perfect.
oh,excuse me one moment.
Hello,rufus.
Oh,I wish I could talk,my darling,but I'm right in the middle of something.
Okay.
Bye.
Lily I just want to thank you for handling this so gracefully the whole rufus thing the whole "rufus and i used to date" thing? Oh,god.
Please tell me that I'm not putting an enormous foot in my mouth.
He told you,right? Well,of course he did.
It's fine.
So you were thinking above the bed? I think it'll look fantastic there.
I figured out the split screen.
All right.
Now we can watch all four games at once.
what were you guys talking about? Are you sure you don't want to go to your family reunion? We know they weren't cool to you and your mom, but,I mean,it seems like your cousin is trying to make up for it.
Yeah,well,unless he's armed with an engraved apology from my grandfather, I do not care.
Nate,they're making an effort.
Yeah,sure they're making an effort now.
But where were they when we needed them? You've told me about your summers with your cousins, about your grandfather teaching you to sail,how much you used to look forward to christmas.
You loved them.
Now if you really don't want to go,fine.
But don't pretend you don't care.
She wasn't my girlfriend.
We just went out a few times.
You might have mentioned that,considering that she works for me.
It was humiliating.
Well,I've been meaning to tell you.
You know,it's a shame we never see each other.
Are there any other exes I should know about-- my trainer,my accountant  I'm sorry.
But it's not like I ever asked you to make a list of everyone you've dated.
Yes,well,I'd be happy to make one.
Sure.
Do you think I wouldn't? - I don't think about it.
I think we should just drop it.
Let's make lists.
Lily.
Look,you clearly have some idea about my past and I'd prefer to dispel, and this way I won't be blindsided again unless, of course,there's something that you don't want known.
All right.
Okay.
Tonight,then,at dinner.
Be ready.
This has disaster written all over it.
oh,there's tripp.
What? Nate,you said it was a mansion,not a country club.
Nate changed your mind.
Six times,actually.
**** - Hey,tripp.
it's flying low.
There must be a hospital nearby.
It's not a medevac.
It's,uh,grandfather's ride.
He's gonna be so surprised to see you.
Wait.
I thought this was his idea.
Not exactly.
So I came to give him a chance,and he didn't even want one? - No.
No,no.
Nate,wait.
You've come this far.
Come on.
nathaniel.
I'm so delighted you're here.
My boy! we've missed you.
Looks like V.
Is leading a lost lamb back to the flock.
And C.
Is coming to B.
Sheepishly bearing gifts.
I would have been here sooner.
I stopped to pick up a little something.
How thoughtful.
Serena thinks you're in some kind of trouble.
Seems to me your only problem is having a party all by your lonesome.
Except she's not alone.
What are you doing with this insect? Having the time of my life.
Thank you very much.
Well,as much as I enjoy bursting your bubble,he's just using you to get at me.
Ask him about his role as a kidnapper for a certain secret gentleman's club.
I should know.
I had him expelled.
Oh,please.
All I did is bring that girl to a waiting pile of cash, which I understand she gladly took before leaving town without you.
Blair this guy-- what? Dishonest?Bad news? He can't be any worse than you.
I'm the one trying to help you.
Help me? Is that what you were doing at your little gentleman's club while my life was going up in flames? I'd rather take carter's help.
We hear carter baizen's dealt chuck another losing hand.
This is a little seat,Secretary of state simon van der bilt.
Governor hamilton van der bilt.
A family history of distinguished public and it all began with johannes van der bilt.
He came to america 250 years ago.
Found coal in pennsylvania.
You n understand why we're proud to be celebrating our family's anniversary this weekend.
We started with almost nothing.
Finally something I can relate to.
And now all this.
Or not.
Nathaniel,let's show your friends the presidential medals of freedom.
finally! So tell me,nathaniel,what are your plans next year? Well,I'm waiting to hear back from colleges.
The only thing is,when everything went down with my father, it was around the time applications were due.
So I didn't exactly knock the essays out of the park.
Another unfortunate by-product of that regrettable situation, which,I might add,you handled admirably.
Admirably? I thought you were ashamed of me.
Oh,on the contrary.
I've never been more proud.
You stood by your mother.
You got your father to do what was right.
I used to worry that,um,you got her looks and his brains,but you proved me wrong on that.
you're a part of this legacy,too,nathaniel.
So who's up for some touch football? Come on.
Do you know how exhausting it's been being blair waldorf for the past 18 ars-- all the work,the planning? You mean plotting? Yes,exactly.
I'm glad it all blew up in my face.
It was a wake-up call.
I was such an overachiever,I was headed for a quarterlife crisis at 18.
Oh,B.
You've had a couple of setbacks, but there must still be a way to get into a great college, and if anyone can do it,it's you.
No,S.
,I've learned the hard way.
I can't control everything,plan everything.
Now with carter's help,I'm trying something different.
Inact,if I'm somewhere,and I can say,"blair waldorf would never do that," guess what?I'll do it.
B.
?B.
You have to pay for those.
So call security.
We have a problem.
Let me guess--carter baizen? As usual,you're a step behind.
He's encouraging the worst in her.
True.
Unfortunately,my P.
I.
Has yet to dig up an unpaid creditor or a jealous husband that would clear baizen out.
Tell him you want to see him.
Why?What do you have? Just do it.
did you and blair find anything you like at V.
B.
H.
? Well,blair certainly did.
Are you reorganizing? Oh,no.
Just reminiscing.
Why is bart's name next to trent reznor and the klauses? Oh,my god.
It's,um-- mom,what is that? - It's-- no,no.
Please don't answer.
It's a long story between me and rufus.
Wait.
You're not showing rufus that,are you? Well,we agreed to be up-front with each other.
Up-front?Okay,but,mom, it's gonna take him 20 minutes to get through the '90s alone.
I know.
I know.
We got into this tiff because he hadn't told me he dated bex.
And then the next thing I know,I was saying yes to lists.
And how am I gonna back out now? Besides,I'm not ashamed of my past most of it,anyway.
Do you think he'll judge? I think you should just sneak a peek at his little black book before you drop the yellow pages on him.
Just make sure your numbers are on par.
Okay.
Slash?Seriously? what,there's no penalty? You want me toall that? I thought this was touch,not rugby.
I forgot how the van der bilts like to play football.
B.
S.
,Man.
Do you quit? No.
No,no,no.
Play.
I remember my first time here.
Intimidating.
I'm maureen,tripp's fianc.
Vanessa.
Nice to meet you.
And "yes" on the intimidating front.
I feel like a republican at the kennedy compound.
Oh,don't fret.
Everyone loves you.
They're probably already designing the campaign posters.
What do you mean? - I assume you saw the hall o' governors? Politics is a van der bilt birthright.
And with nate's charm and your background - excuse me? Nate mentioned you're kind of an activist in your community-- a documentary filmmaker? Oh,yeah.
Well,I think you've been misinformed.
The only thing nate's ever voted for isamerican idol.
" Tripp was the same way.
He wanted to be an archaeologist in college,like indiana jones.
Now he's law review at yale and about to clerk for the supreme court.
Grandfather can be very persuasive.
welcome to the next 30 years.
I'm surprised.
You waved the white flag so soon.
Goes down almost as easy as you did.
So it was all just a game.
initially,yes.
Though I have to admit,blair surprised me.
that girl certainly knows how to let loose.
Victory never tasted so sweet.
Speaking of which,do you mind if I take this? Blair's meeting me at a party,and it's not the kind of place she should be left alone.
Actually,I don't think you're gonna be making that.
what's this? Good cop/bass cop? Blair needs to regroup,so you need to bid adieu.
Dubai again? nice try,but I'm having too much fun.
Nothing's gonna get me to leave town.
What about santorini? Do you think blair will want to hear about that? The greek guy--spiros? The greek police? I still have all of their phone numbers from when they questioned me.
You wouldn'T.
I would,but I won't if you leave town now,alone.
E therare a few things I could hold over your head from that trip.
But consider us even.
If the two of you think that getting rid of me is gonna magically change back your friend,think again.
I'm just a symptom of the disease,not the cause.
What happened in santorini? Let's find blair.
I want to make sure she's okay.
Spotted--B.
Taking one small step for new blair one giant step towards a strange townhouse.
Enter at your own risk,B.
Hello.
whatever your style.
The new schick quattro I think we've made a cle possible small talk.
I think we should just get it over with before the kids come home.
I will,uh,go first.
Is it all right? Yes,of course.
Um and this is the whole thing? That's it.
Okay.
Well,then,that's just,uh okay,I'll just get mine.
oh,here I am.
I'm sorry.
It's just,well,I'm-- I'm relieved please don't take that the wrong way.
Oh,no.
It's just you've dated more people than I have, and I wasn't sure that we'd be in the same ballpark.
Well,I'm glad that that is behind us.
Me,too.
I'll get dessert.
What happened to you? It's called,uh,getting to know the van der bilts.
Turned out to be less "gatsby" and more "fight club.
Don't worry.
I'm okay.
I'm fine.
Well,you'd better recover by tomorrow.
Nate told his grandfather we'd come to the reception at the country house.
Oh,reception at the country house.
That's very blazer and chinos.
Do you want me to overnight you a rep tie from bluefly? Thanks,no.
Could you get me something for my ankle? Sure.
So? - Spill it.
Spill what? Come on,the minute we dropped nate off,you just-- you clammed up,and you got that look on your face.
What look?I don't have a look.
He's right.
You definitely have the look.
Here.
Cold.
You're right.
Thank you.
Fine.
When I encouraged nate to reconnect with his family,I had no idea it came with such expectations.
And it just sounds like nate's grandfather lays out your life for you.
They're the van der bilts,not the corleones.
This may snd silly.
It's just I don't want nate to get pushed in to the family sausage grinder and come out a clone of his cousin.
Why don't you just tell him that? Because he just got his grandfather back in his life,and he seems really happy.
And the last thing I'd want to do is say something that might keep them apart.
Nate's a pretty understanding guy when he's not maiming people on the football field.
So if you're worried,yeah,you should just tell him.
What do you mean,she's not here?She went to that pty alone? Look,you have to tell us where she is.
I am sorry,but miss blair very specific-- no tell miss serena,no tell mr.
Chuck.
But if mr.
Chuck come,tell him mr.
Carter is more attentive to a woman's-- enough.
I'm not going to play where's waldorf? All night.
How much is it gonna cost? How much? miss blair dorota,dorota,please.
Can't you see that blair has changed? Yes.
It is old miss blair then new miss blair, like it was old miss serena,now new miss serena.
Very hard to keep track.
Okay.
Okay.
Blair is at a party right now alone with some very bad people.
We just want to help her.
Please.
I know grandfather's pretty strong-willed,but if you're worried I'm gonna be pushed into anything,don't be.
Because I am really happy that you've reconnected with your family.
Just-- Nothing's gonna change.
hold on just one second.
Hey,tripp.
What's going on? Wait.
Where,in the city? I'd love to,but I'm on a date right now.
Yeah.
All right,just tell grandfather I said I'm sorry.
All right,thanks,man.
Bye.
You should go meet them.
But we're eating pierogies.
**** ********* ****
don't forget we have the party tomorrow.
Okay.
All right.
Have fun.
may I help you? - Great.
Looks like polanski's in town.
please don't do this.
Blair.
Chuck? What are you doing here? Miss waldorf,as I was saying,I met with you as a favor to your headmistress.
But sarah lawrence cannot accept someone who has hazed a teacher.
But,dean wheeler,that was a - dean wheeler? - looks like we may have made an error.
Colleges stopped accepting applications months ago.
Please?I don't have any other options.
I'm sorry,but you have my answer.
B.
B.
,Why didn't you tell us? What,that I was coming to debase myself by begging to be accepted at sarah lawrence? Gee,you're right.
Why didn't I update my facebook page? It's nice to know the old blair is still in there somewhere.
I knew you wouldn't give up.
You're wrong.
I just did.
Don't follow me! Poor B.
Couldn't spin this one in her favor.
Looks like now she's spinning out.
why are we crashing nate's family reunion? And why would blair be here? Well,dorota tipped me off.
She's coming.
Maybe she's ready to relaunch herself into blue blood society.
Blair! Hey,you--you look great.
I feel great.
Why? Because I realized that while we can't tear out a single page of our life, we can throw the whole book in the fire.
George sand.
She understands me.
And what better place to go up ismoke than in front of the cre de la crme of new york society? Blair waldorf.
How are you,dear? I heard you've rejected the colony club.
Too stuffy for my taste,as well.
That's because your tastes include sleeping with your driver and popping prescription meds.
Okay,not good.
Not good--like dan having s*x with rachel carr in the costume closet during the school play,not good? By the end of tonight,the old blair waldorf will be dead and buried with no chance of resurrection.
Hey,you,garn with the bubble butt.
Arr! - That was - yeah.
Go find dan.
I'll make sure this social eulogy doesn't get out of hand.
Thanks,chuck.
Security check? I can't even put my lipstick in here.
What could I possibly be trying to sneak in? I don't know.
Liberal agenda? Universal health care?Education reform? Increase in the estate tax? well I see you got my delivery.
Ah,yes,I did.
Thank you.
It fits perfectly.
Of course it does.
Glad you could join us again,daniel.
I hope we weren't too hard on you yesterday.
Oh,no,no.
I've always wanted a football injury to impress the ladies with.
Touch football injury? Would you two mind if I borrowed him for a while? No,you two go and talk and we'll,um,catch up with you later.
Drink? - Drinks.
You think the humphreys have a crest? Maybe something jenny could stitch on to one of my cardigans? And,uh,don't for tthe egg rolls.
Very important.
All right,thanks.
Lil? Do you have,uh,cash for tip? rufus,do you need something? how about the truth? Vanessa.
Tripp.
You look like you're having fun.
Top-shelf all the way.
so you excited for nate's big adventure this summer? He told you about our backpacking trip? I was talking about the internship at the mayor's office.
It's why william wanted nate to meet him last night.
You didn't know.
There must be a misunderstanding.
Nate and I are traveling this summer.
Yeah.
I-I guess there must be.
anything you want to say to me? Who ld you? Tripp.
tell me that you told your grandfather you already made plans for the summer.
Look,I haven't made any decisions yet.
No,you haven'T.
Your grandfather made this decision for you.
It's not like that.
Then tell me what it's like,because two days ago you were so excited to get away from everything,just the two of us.
I know,and I still am,okay? But it is an amazing opportunity.
For what?To turn into tripp?Is that who you wanna be in five year I don't know who I want to become in the next five years.
That's the point.
If this is something I honestly thought you wanted,I'd be happy for you.
But can you really tell me this isn't about what william wants you to do? As opposed to what you want me to do? I didn't mean that.
It's just my grandfather believes in me.
so - Oh,blair.
What are we talking about? - It's good to see you,blair.
Is your mother here? No.
It's a shame,though.
She should be here to see this.
oh,you must have her call me.
Gerald and I just got engaged,and I need an eleanor waldorf design for the big day.
Sure.
Though,I think she discontinued her "third-trip-down-the-aisle- only-took-the-plunge- for-money" line.
Oh,blair.
I think you've had too much to drink.
Oh,you would know.
Three D.
U.
I.
S now,is it?Now that I blame you.
Her way to escape the whispers that you made your money in adult entertainment web sites.
***** - Bye.
big fan of your sites.
You about done? No.
What are you doing? Trying to destroy thu,old yo burn every bridge? It won't help.
Believe me.
I've tried.
Well,maybe I should head up to the roof,make it a little more dramatic.
This isn't you.
How do you know? Because I know you better than I know myself.
Oh,right.
You can see right through me can't you,chuck? Right to my core.
Do you remember the first time you saw the real me? The blair that danced for you that night at victrola? The blair with none of the hang-ups,none of the frustrations-- that's the blair right here.
take me now.
Why? To prove that nothing matters.
No.
This isn't you.
It's not the blair I want.
That's right.
And I never will be again.
The danger with calling someone's bluff is that even if you win good-bye,chuck.
You risk them walking away from the table for good.
And who likes to play with themselves? What are you doing out here? I don't know.
Well,here.
Take that.
Do you remember the first time you brought me here? When we first started dating? - We were,like-- we used to talk about our future.
How perfect everything would be.
Remember? Yeah.
what happened? when did.
everything get so screwed up? This isn't how it's supposed to be.
I don't know who I am anymore,what I'm supposed to do.
I feel so - lost.
Do you remember when you used to make us watch your favorite movies over and over again? Like "tiffany's" and "holiday"? It used to drive me nuts.
Is this a pep talk? Well,I finally asked you why you liked watching movies you've already seen, and you remember what you said? I like knowing how things are gonna turn out.
Exactly.
You know,growing up,I never knew who I was supposed to be so I'd spend all my time apologizing for the privilege and the wealth and the opportunities I felt other people deserved more than I did.
And you know what I'm finally learning? You can't fight against who you are.
And you are blair waldorf.
What happened to the nate archibald who just wanted to get high and play "halo"? I don't know.
Well,I better,um,I better head inside.
Nate.
Don't forget your jacket.
Thank you.
Nasere,How are - What was that for? I don't know,newland archer.
Try to rack your brain a little.
Blair told you about me and rachel.
And the costume closet,yes.
Well,you and I were broken up.
Oh,so that makes it okay to have s*x with a teacher? - She wasn't my teacher.
No,she was mine, and you slept with her at school,during a play,with me probably 20 feet away.
Okay,right.
Yeah.
Yeah,when you put it like that mm.
What?why are you smiling? I don't know.
I am mad,but that was invigorating.
well,that's good.
It's good to know that you enjoy hitting people.
oh,and look.
That's wonderful.
I'll be sure to check that out on bitchslappedagain.
Com later.
Let's go get you ice.
This looks great.
And you remembered the egg rolls.
Make sure I only eat a few.
I'm gonna feel guilty.
T likely.
Okay.
Enough.
What's going on with you? I'm sorry.
I was going to tell you.
Let's just pretend like this ver ha.
Ened that's obviously what you wanted.
That's not fair.
No kidding,which is why I didn't show you some condensed version of my list.
Your list was a dozen people.
How much more condensed could it have been? embarrassed about my past.
No,you're just embarrassed about mine.
When you saw the condensed version,you told me you were relieved.
So I think we found out everything we needed to know about each other.
I've been looking for you.
About before,what I forgot to tell you is I believe in you,too,just a different you.
Ladies and gentlemen,may I have your attention,please? As we celebrate our family's past this weekend,we also look to its future.
Our grandson,nathaniel,is graduating from st.
Jude's this year,and,I'm proud to announce, has been offered an internship in the mayor's office.
Nathaniel? - I'm sorry.
Well,our fami has many traditions.
Some,like touch football,come at a steeper price than others.
but what they all have in common is commitment to bringing out the best in yourself, your potential,even if you're not sure what that is.
I hope to find out this summer in the mayor's office.
Yes.
That's what I wanted to hear.
How about that? Call your travel agent,kiddies.
Looks like nate archibald traded in a summer of love for a one-way ticket to his legacy.
You left early.
What happened with blair? chuck? Okay.
Fine.
Have fun drinking by yourself.
I'm losing her.
Well,then fight for her.
She did for you.
I tried.
I failed.
Well,then try again.
She's scared,chuck.
Her plan hasn't worked out for her,and she doesn't know what's gonna happen next.
If you want to be back in her life,make her feel safe.
You know what to say.
I can't believe you guys broke up.
We didn't exactly break up.
Or maybe we did.
I don't know.
I just left.
It was bad,whatever it was.
Welcome to the world of upper east side grandparents.
I've gone up against them myself,and they're a lot tougher than they look.
So what do I do? Well just give him some space.
I mean,he needs time to work through everything.
okay.
Yeah,space is key.
I mean,you guys belong together.
God,I'm hungry.
why do rich people insist on tiny food? Well,that's how they stay rich.
They only buy small food.
okay,music.
Hey,listen.
It's gonna be okay.
I thought you'd left.
I did.
Well,why don't you try it again?Maybe this time it will take.
I made a new list.
It's not what you think.
Murphy's "Romance novels,sonoma cabernets,christmas tree ornaments" that's the only list I need to know-- things that you make you happy or sad or crazy.
Althou that last one would be kind of hard to condense.
Just know that I'm--I'm sorry.
Why? This whole thing was my fault.
I'm the one that wanted to open the door to the past.
Well,consider it closed.
I don't get it.
I mean,I know you were married for 18 years, but you were the lead singer of a not entirely unpopular band, and I remember beautiful girls throwing themselves at you every night.
That's true but the majority of that time,I was pining for a certain blonde photojournalist.
Springtime--a season for rebirth and new beginnings.
For some,it's a chance to turn over a new leaf I told doorman no visitors.
Mr.
Chuck it's late.
I just need a moment of her time.
Miss blair asleep.
I'm sorry.
Can you tell her that I stopped by and that I have something I need to tell her? I will,in morning.
thank you for making sure I got home okay.
You're welcome.
I just want to make sure you're fine,which you are,so I should go.
Wait.
For others,it's the surprise of seeing something bloom.
Stay.
but for yours truly, it's aeminder that on the upper east side, everything old can be new again.
XOXO GOSSIP GIRL
Gossip girl here Your one and only source Take me now.
Why? To prove that nothing matters.
That's not the blair i want.
What are you doing with this insect? Having the time of my life, thank you.
Serena is in "women's wearar daily.
" with poppy lifton.
Remember when we were savannah and svetlana.
I totally forgot about savannah and svetlana.
Andrew got caught in a riptide.
Yeah, if we had known, we wouldn't have even bothered you.
-Is it over? -we've already lost one son.
we weren't losing another.
So you excited for nate's big adventure this summer? He told you about our backpacking trip? i was talking about the internship at the mayor's office.
-i should go.
-Wait.
stay.
Mornings are simply more fun on the upper east side.
Our favorite things to wake up to--the sun in the sky, The nikkei on the rise And a wake-up call from your latest lover - Or your best friend.
again, serena? -Good.
you're up.
-yes, i'm up, just like i was up yesterday And the morning before that.
Well, after the whole carter/chuck thing, You can't blame me for wanting to check in on you.
And as much as i appreciate the concern, s.
, My downward spiral is on the upturn.
I'm at home in my p.
j.
s, eating french toast With dorota.
Come on! what was that? -Get off the phone! -dorota has a cold.
Dorota, i told you not to use your handkerchief in the table It's disgusting.
Oh, it sounded like a car horn.
it must have been on my end.
Where are you? I'm on 73rd and madison, headed to via quadronno To get some pastries for our new-family breakfast.
Well, uh, if i wasn't so full on french toast, I would ask you to bring me one.
see you at school.
And tell dorota to feel better.
I have here in my hands my first fan letter.
What, did you write it yourself? No.
no.
"the new yorker" forwarded it to me.
Some kid read my story.
he loved it.
Sent me his own story.
i mean, he wants my opinion.
But i figured it'd be good practice for yale Since they make you do a crit with your classmates.
Oh, a fan that gives homework.
lovely.
Mm.
what's this? it's my entry packet from yale that come to.
There's just a couple of forms for you to fill out, And then we're done.
look at us.
everything's working out.
You're in yale and jenny might actually make it to 16.
That was a little touch-and-go there for a while.
Yes, but i still have 24 hours to mess up, so Uh, dad, i don't smell coffee.
Yeah, and the waffle iron is cold.
Oh, yeah.
lily's doing breakfast today.
She wants to talk to us.
ominous.
Or delicious.
i mean, do you know how many types of jam They have there? come on.
we're gonna be late.
A lot.
Hey.
i'll be there in a second.
Would you care to read my fan letter in person? As happy as i am for you, i'm a little freaked out.
I gave nate a week to call, and he hasn't.
Well, if I remembere right You left him alone at a party where he was being honored.
Which i feel terrible about.
I just wish he would give me a chance to apologize.
Oh, he will, when he's ready.
Okay.
Did you just set me up? What do you mean? nate just sent me an e-mail.
He wants me to meet him at his place in a half-hour.
Really? well, that-- i mean, i was just winging it, But that's good.
Serena! Hi! Poppy.
oh, my gosh.
hey.
oh, it's so good to see you.
I was beginning to think We weren't running in the same circles anymore.
It's been so long.
cute coat.
oh, thanks.
you--you look great I love your hair and your tan.
oh, we just got back from Spain.
"we"? yeah, me and my new boyfriend gabriel.
He's so wonderful, serena.
you'd love him.
i-i'd love to meet him.
You should.
But we're only in town for 48 hours, though.
Gabriel had to come in for business, But we're gonna fly right back to costa brava On sunday morning.
so what about you? what's new? Seeing anybody? uh, yeah.
dan and i got back together, But then we broke up again.
Oh, i'm sorry.
And your friend-- what's her name? blair? Yeah.
how's she doing? Uh, good now.
there was this thing between us, But then we worked it out, so wow.
Well, it sounds like everything's exactly the same As it was last time i saw you.
Makes catching up easier, though, right? yeah.
I-i'm throwing a party this weekend.
Really? oh, what's the occasion? not that you need one.
Oh, it's--it's for a friend.
it's for her sweet 16.
Oh.
that's sweet.
Yeah.
uh, you should come.
Yeah.
i'll, um, i'll have to check my schedule, But i'll let you know.
yeah.
please--please do.
Okay.
Well, um, have fun with your little party, And, um, just take care of yourself, okay? Lily, i can't believe you made us breakfast.
Oh, i just toasted some bagels and fried some bacon and bugeen Oh, really, it's no big deal.
Well, if you turned on a burner, lil, it's a big deal.
You are really committed to making this family work.
I'm proud of you, mom.
aw.
thank you.
Oh, charles, are you staying for breakfast? I have an appointment What does chuck bass do on 8 am? It's not like you work out.
i do my cardio in the evenings.
Morning is for business, for which i am late.
So if you'll excuse me Does this feel like a sitcom to anybody else? It feels like a reality show.
good.
so i can vote you off.
It would almost be scary If it wasn't wearing plaid.
um, wait, wait.
You guys didn't start without me, did you? hey.
You didn't tell her yet.
no.
What? tell me what? well, we wanted to tell you in person and all of you.
We are planning a sweet 16 party for you here, tomorrow night.
Fantastic caterer and beautiful flowers.
D.
j.
, the perfect guest list.
We wanted it to be a surprise, though.
We heard you had one of those last year, And it didn't go so well.
oh, jenny cake.
Well, that's why this year, i was more than happy To delegate to people who know better.
So what do you think? Uh wow.
i You're not excited? No, i am.
i totally am.
But Okay, look, last year, I would have killed for a party like this.
But this year, i-i don't know.
Things just--things just seem different.
like--like, okay, I was just kind of hoping that it would be us And vanessa and jonathan, and then i don't even-- Maybe those two girls from my chem class Who didn't light my hair on fire that one time.
I'm sorry.
is that okay? yeah.
yeah.
I mean, well, maybe you should just try the cake first.
Of course it's okay.
it's your birthday.
It's whatever you want.
yeah, yeah.
no, it's not a problem.
I'll--i'll just-- i'll cancel.
i'm thinking my famous chili.
Maybe some board games.
Yeah.
yeah.
Um, but really, thank you so much for thinking of me.
It means a lot.
Um, i'll just go cancel the caterer.
I should probably get to school.
I don't understand why she wouldn't want it.
Every culture in the world has some version of a sweet 16 party.
It's like a universal rite of passage.
Well, since she got back to constance, Jenny hasn't exactly made a lot of friends.
You know, downsizing the party might have something to do With the fear that no one will show up.
Serena.
Word is out that your party went from 60 to zero in the last hour.
.
We knew you'd accept defeat gracefully.
What are you talking about? You canceled jenny's party to move off penelope's date.
Penelope's having a party tomorrow night? Since when? Since always.
we were all going, but at least now We don't have to pretend to feel bad about missing yours.
Hey, p.
hey, girls.
how excited are you about the part don't cancel Spotted--s.
learning the answer to the age-old question, "what if you were throwing a party and no one cared?" When that happens, don't cancel Poppy, hey.
it's serena.
You know that party i was telling you about? I was hoping we could meet up.
I need your help.
Make them eat cake.
I see you got the e-mail i sent from Nate's account.
His password has been "soccer" since the fifth grade.
Look, Blair leaves his place at this time every morning.
When you're ready to do something about it, You know where i am.
And when you're not from the upper east side, Sometims a morning is just beginning to a very bad day.
I'm all foyou and nate Isn't that a bit "been there, done that, got dumped twice"? Nate and I are purely platonic.
I've seen you leave his place in the morning.
Oh, of course you're stalking me.
You know, if you were any good at it, You would know i bring him breakfast.
We're just friends.
we haven't shared so much kiss even Friends? That makes total sense.
There's no spark between you two, never was.
You're like a green twig and a soggy match, A rusty hammer and an icy nail.
Nate and I have had plenty of spark.
-Better than that--fireworks.
That was us.
Chuck Don't act like i didn't fight for you.
I did--hard, and for a long time.
So please, Forgive me if now that we're over, i'm exhausted.
So what, you're with nate because it's easy? I'm not with nate.
But if i was, what's wrong with easy? Maybe it's easy because it's right.
Oh, really? is that why nate is so reluctant To break things off with vanessa? You do know they're still dating, right? Try this.
Wonderful.
hey, is the, uh, yale packet around, dad? I just--i wanted to look at the dorms.
Oh, jeez.
i-i think i left it at lil's.
sorry.
Oh, okay.
that's all right.
I'll just get it tomorrow.
But, uh, let me know if you two need help.
hmm.
Why did you just lie to him? the packet's right there.
Dan was denied financial aid at yale.
Funds are limited, And these days, there are a lot of other students That need it more than we do.
I'm sorry.
do you save, Of course, but i-i planned On at least part of his tuition being subsidized.
Well, um, i mean, i could help you out.
Thank you, but no.
as kind as it is for you to offer, I think i need to handle this on my own.
I just wish i had an idea.
Well, you could sell the loft, and then you'd have, um, Enough for dan's tuition and then some.
And this is where dan and jenny grew up.
Besides, where would we live? on the streets? Well you could move in with me.
That's a big step, lil.
I know.
but i always saw it as the next one for us anyway.
Are we ready for that? Well, there's one way to find out.
Look, why don't you just talk to an agent And see what they say? You know what i was just thinking? Jennifer aniston is totally fine now.
I'm sure brad doesn't even feel bad anymore.
okay.
I mean, i'm sure that there was some collateral damage, Which is always sad, but his fate lay with angelina, And he knew that, So he had the tough conversation and moved on.
This is your way of saying i should break up with vanessa? So me and you can embrace our fate.
Ah.
yes.
Okay.
well, i wasn't actually gonna tell you this Till afterwards, but vanessa called a couple hours ago, And she just wants to talk, So i asked her to meet me for dinner.
But can't you just text? No.
But what if when you see her, There's sparks or fireworks, even? You know, they say breakup s*x is-- hey, hey, hey, hey.
Vanessa and i--it feels over, And i'm sure she's gonna tell me the same thing.
Listen, i promise i'll come straight over after it's done.
On their first trip to africa, Brad and angelina's lovemaking was so intense, The guards thought they were being attacked.
Well, how about i just start by talking to vanessa And see where all this goes? sound good? Sounds great.
Okay.
Oh, you must be jenny.
it's so nice to meet you.
oh.
I'm poppy.
hi.
Serena, i wasn't expecting any of this.
Oh, well, my mom wanted you to have your dream dress.
We thought missoni would be right, So i brought a friend to help with the selection.
So what about that one? Well, i wish i was the kind of girl Who was having the kind of party Where i could wear this kind of dress.
I'm not, so I-i think--i guess i'll just-- i'll just try this one.
Hey.
thanks for meeting me.
After i saw you this morning, i felt kind of terrible.
I'm--i'm in a rut, aren't i? Yeah.
well, a girl like you Should be on the arm of a designer At the costume ball one day And yachting around the maldives the next, Not making up and breaking up with the same high school boy And feuding with your frenemy.
I know.
What--what can i do? Well, this party would be a good place to start.
Yeah, i-i-i thought that, But jenny is just really set on something more simple.
Any 16-year-old girl would love The kind of party that you should be throwing-- Adult, elegant, the right notables in attendance.
And you saw the way that she looked at that dress.
She loves it.
she wants a party like this.
She just needs someone to hold her hand a little.
So what do you think? We like that one better.
Okay.
i guess-- i guess i'll just try it on.
See? she loves it.
that's all the proof you need.
You know, it's not too late.
Why don't you start making some phone calls? Hi.
it's serena van der woodsen.
Um, i know my mom might have called you this morning, But there's been a mistake.
The party's not canceled.
it's--it's still on, And actually, it's--it's gonna be bigger.
Hi.
Hi.
Thanks for meeting me.
it's really good to see you.
I have a feeling you're not gonna like what i have to say.
Hey, don't act surprised, v.
You saw this coming.
i mean, you left first.
I know, but I mean, i'm sure we can do something To figure it all out, if we tried.
Okay.
Well, at least we can end things honestly, right? - Right.
because if there is someone else, You could tell me.
Probably make things easier.
This is about you and me.
no one else.
Really? - yeah, really.
It's 10:30, dorota.
what took him so long? Maybe girl from Brokenly cry.
Mr Nate nicely boy.
He wipe tears.
he touch her hair.
She touch his.
Dorota.
Not that it's ever happen to me.
It's done.
Whoa.
don't look too happy.
Oh, right.
sorry.
Was it awful? No.
things had come to a natural end, so And it had nothing to do with anyone else.
Of course.
it was just about you guys.
Hey, listen.
it's, um, it's getting late, And i've had a really tough day.
So how about tomorrow, okay? We could hang out this weekend.
Pour that dom down the drain, dorota.
Wait.
is that the '96? What happened, miss blair? He kissed me on the forehead, Like chevalier kissed gigi Like he was a man, and i was a little girl.
No passion, no spark.
Maybe chuck was right.
Maybe all nate and i have together is just History.
Poor b.
it's hard to turn up the heat with an old flame.
But stand back.
Someone's about to add fuel to this fire.
I have to say, i was a little surprised when you called.
That he dumped me, i can accept, But then he had the nerve To say that there was nothing between him and blair.
The "just friends" speech? i got it, too.
They're making fools of us.
Well, not anymore.
Wow.
you got a lot of board games there.
Uh, you know, we're going to a birthday party.
It's not a bomb shelter.
Yeah, well, i want to have options.
Uh, do you know if vanessa's coming? - yeah.
Yeah, she and nate broke up last night.
It seems like she's taking it pretty hard, But, uh, she wants to come to the party, - Said she'd call.
Okay Oh, and that's probably her.
Hello? Mr.
humphrey? it's gail from brooklyn realty.
I wanted to schedule a time For our appraiser to come out to your loft.
Is this a bad time? Uh, yeah.
you know, i'll call you later.
Not vanessa? No.
you know, we should probably start getting ready.
Okay.
Wait.
back up, blair.
nate and vanessa broke up? Oh, they had a falling-out after the van der bilt party, Hadn't spoken for a week and broke up last night.
How do you know all this? Have you dumped me for vanessa? No.
i've just been spending a lot of time with nate.
Oh.
where is this coming from? - What? - you and nate? After all that you've been through? You sure it's not just because nate's not chuck? I thought chuck was my future, Nate a part of my past.
But now i'm thinking Chuck was just something i had to get out of my system In order to realize nate was my destiny all along.
Well, if that's really how you feel, Then i'm happy for you.
It's not exactly like i was rooting for chuck, And nate is good for you.
no drama.
Nate and i have plenty of drama and sparks and fireworks.
Uh-huh.
when are you getting to my party? You mean jenny's party.
So do you have any idea what's going on out there?
B., i gotta go. I'm sorry.
Jenny's gonna love it.
Hey, vanya.
"Guilty liberal 'victims' and their assault on america" By ann coulter? Dorota gave to me.
she said important to know enemy.
It's okay.
i read to make dorota happy.
I have to say, i'm excited.
Oh, you should be.
Dad only makes his chili on very special occasions.
Well, not just about my birthday.
I mean, of course about my birthday, but, you know, Lily and dad and all of us together? I don't know.
things just seem to be going really good.
Yeah.
a little too good.
What? since when is "good" too good? Dan? Uh, y-you know that phone call that wasn't vanessa? It was a real estate agent.
I think dad might be selling the loft.
What? no.
where would we live? Well, i'd be at college.
I guess you and dad would be Moving on up to the east side, To a deluxe apartment in the sky-y-y.
Okay, yeah, yeah, funny.
first of all, You need to stop watching so many old sitcoms on hulu, And second, dad on the upper east side? I mean, there's no way.
no, we can't live up here.
we're - Humphy's.
Damn straight We grew up good.
you know that? Yeah.
Okay.
it looks familiar And yet Not bad, little j.
What are you doing here? Once i heard poppy lifton was coming to your party, I canceled mine.
in the last 20 minutes, I've been hit on by two bronfmans and a gay designer.
It was so worth it.
Kudos on rising from the social grave.
Speaking of graves, did something die in that pot? It's cumin.
I liked my social grave.
I dug it myself, and i was happy to lie in it.
What's going on? why are they here? I don't know.
This chili weighs a ton, though.
I need to find a caterer.
Jenny, hey.
i didn't see you come in.
How could you with all this fabulous going on? well done.
Happy birthday, jenny.
Poppy, i didn't expect to see you.
Hey, uh, will you get us some drinks? - sure.
Well, surprised? Confused.
i mean, what is all this? Where's my dad and lily? they're at "billy elliot," fifth road center I-i told them that a girl only turns 16 once, And she needs to spend it with her friends And friends of friends.
my present to you.
serena, i didn't want this.
Well, i thought you didn't want a social fiasco Where--where you planned something And people didn't show up, but this is perfect.
I mean, jenny, all of these people are here for you.
Patrick, hey.
uh, would you take a picture - With me and the birthday girl? - sure.
It's a birthday? Excuse me.
Enjoying my party? You know, i was just saying to jonathan That this is a lovely, intimate family gathering.
Nothing says "jenny humphrey" Like a customized cocktail napkin.
mm.
Eric, i don't get it.
Why would serena hijack my birthday? Well, i know she was trying to do something nice for you.
Maybe she just got a little carried away.
And maybe she wanted to prove to everyone She could still throw a great party.
Well if she wants people to know What a great party she can throw, Why not tell everyone? I came to you because i wanted to do something Besides feel sorry for myself, but all it's been is Sleazy platitudes and You staring at my boobs.
I came up with several excellent ideas.
You just shot most of them down.
Yeah, because they all involved Leaking a chuck/vanessa s*x tape to the internet.
We don't have to leak the tape if you don't want to.
Consistent, if twisted.
Why are they here? What do we do? Spotted--two people who should know better And two people who don't know what hit them.
No, of course there's no keg! Serena, who are these rowdy children? I mean, i know jenny's young, but this is embarrassing.
I know.
i know.
i'm so sorry.
Um, just give me a minute, and--and i'll figure this out.
We're leaving.
you should come with.
Trust me, i would love to get out of here right now, But i think i should deal with the table dancers first.
I'll--i'll catch up with you later.
well, do try, for your own good Yeah.
Jenny.
jenny, please help me get rid of these pf Um, they're not crashing, serena.
i invited them.
Well, you have your guest list, and i have mine.
Yeah, but--but this can't be what you want.
Like you care what i want.
Jenny, i genuinely thought that when you got of You would be thrilled, and if you weren't, Then i'm sorry, but you should have just said something.
Serena, i did, at breakfast, and you clearly-- -Serena -um it's fine.
jenny and are just having our first fight.
-There are strangers having s*x in your bed.
-oh, my god.
Wait.
did you get that out of my mother's closet? The word he used was, uh, uh, "haunting," "a haunting sense of immediacy.
" I love that.
oh.
yeah, he's-- he's a smart guy, my fan.
He's a good writer.
he's a good writer.
dan, help.
Well, i'm kind of in the middle of something.
Well, i need you to be in the middle Of something else.
Where'd your boyfriend go? We're not a couple.
It's just physical.
I'll take your word for it.
But listen, whatever's going on between you two, Just make sure chuck Doesn't talk you into doing something you regret.
Whatever's going on with chuck wasn't his idea.
it was mine, And least he doesn't pretend to be one thing, When really he's another.
-You said there was no one else.
-there's not.
Blair's my friend.
nothing's happened between us.
Well, not yet.
But he's telling you the truth.
Nate's a good guy.
If you'd have seen that, maybe you'd still be together.
Now that he's free, who knows what will happen? Exactly.
we don't know.
we're just hanging out.
Sure, that's what people do at parties, hang out.
But later, when we're alone-- blair -We'll talk about it.
-what is there to talk about? Okay, do you guys want to have this conversation -Somewhere else, alone? why are you still standing here? Blair, what are we doing in here? You're not leaving this room until we find out Once and for all if we're really just friends.
Well, don't just stare at me.
do something.
Blair, stop acting like me being your friend Is some kind of plot to humiliate you, okay? Did you ever think that maybe Things didn't work out between us Because we weren't friends? You're right, nate.
This week, you've become my friend.
It's amazing, And i've never wanted to kiss my friend so much in my life.
We're at a party full of people in chuck's room, And he and vanessa are right behind the wall.
That doesn't excite you? Blair Don't.
Only my boyfriend gets to touch my hair.
They have been in there for a while.
What if all we did is push 'em closer together? You just need to relax And trust in the power of our overwhelming sexual chemistry To drive a wedge between them.
Go intercept him.
It looks like that went well.
You wanted to be more like blair waldorf? Well, congratulations.
you succeeded.
Poor v.
nobody gets what they want Without losing something they love, Like their integrity.
-Stains.
-ooh.
ew! gross! I can't believe jenny would turn A sophisticated soiree into a teenage rager.
Well, you did turn her sprabble and sloppy joe party Into a sophisticated soiree, so you know, Not that the punishment exactly fits the crime.
Well, maybe on some entirely subconscious level, I was thinking of myself.
Well, yes, it--it may have been somewhat conscious, But i don't know.
My--my life has just felt so normal lately.
Getting back together with you and breaking up again, Fighting with blair and then not-- It just--it all felt so high school.
well, we are iihat's going o At least for a little while longer.
Old people seem oddly nostalgic for this time ihat's going on Is it gonna make me sound like my dad If i say that you have the rest of your life To throw these fabulous society parties, But this might be the last opportunity you have To roust naked strangers from making love on your mattress? Actually, you know, it sounds a lot like college.
Serena, we have a problem.
How was i supposed to know that if i threw you The best party of the year, you would sabotage it? How was i supposed to know how many kids would show up? Parasites! hooligans! get! Vanya.
vanya, what's going on? Worse than the rats, with their cell phones over and over.
It's too much.
go home! Away, before i-- Call the cops.
-politzia.
Well, at least they scared everyone away.
Hi, kids.
We're home.
-Oh, my god.
oh, my god.
-okay, lil, deep breath.
Oh! things definitely got out of hand, But the most important thing is that the kids are okay.
Yes, well, that may be the most important thing, But the second most important thing is the apartment-- The furniture, the--the rugs, the art, the--my closet.
I thought i recognized that dress.
Serena, how did this happen? Mom, i admit i made a few phone calls.
If you want to punish someone for the passed hors d'oeuvres, Point the finger here.
guilty as charged.
But as far as all the people Oh, and you expect me to believe that jenny was behind this? After she had me cancel the best caterer in town Because she wanted clue and a crock-pot.
Mom, you could-- Could at least make an attempt to mask your distaste.
Don't you dare leave me here to clean up this mess, serena.
When this family was just me and eric, If things got out of control, It was a pretty safe bet that it was my fault.
that's true.
But as this family grows, so does the pool of suspects.
This is not my mess.
Okay, so whose mess is it? I mean, all i did was carry the chili And prevent teenagers from having unprotected s*x.
Serena may have had her own motives I may have helped With the crowd situation with a few inspirational words, But, um But i was the one who posted the party on "gossip girl.
" Look, i'm sorry, lily, And i'm sorry, dad.
And i don't know.
maybe serena was just trying to be nice, But the party that she threw was totally embarrassing.
Jenny, i don't understand.
Um, it sounds to me like what serena put together Was delightful.
You know, at least last year, it was my face on the cake.
And the people at my party might have hated me, But at least they knew who i was.
I know that it's hard for you guys to understand, But i like being me, and as crazy as it may seem, I choose not to be a park avenue princess On my birthday or any other day, No matter what my address might be.
What are you talking about, jenny? The real estate agent called today.
Dad, you and lily might want to live together, But i'm just not ready to stop being a humphrey.
Wait.
live together? Teenage ragers, Annoying sort of siblings, being yelled at by my mother-- This should not be my life.
It doesn't have to be, sweetie.
I mean, so what if your stock took a dip in last quarter Whose didn't? but that doesn't mean You can't still turn things around.
well, then what are your suggestion And don't say to host another party.
No.
Uh, well, it sounds to me like you need to get away.
Yes.
yes! road trip.
No.
i was thinking more like a private jet to spain.
Yeah.
mm, see, even my fantasies are becoming dull.
Listen, gabriel's parents' place is insanely beautiful, And the weather and the food And gabriel's hot friends - Mm.
when do we leave? - tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow? I i'm embarrassed to say this, But i-i think i might be grounded.
Serena No.
I know.
Yeah, i mean, you're right.
Yeah, let's go to spain.
To espa! - to espa! Uh-oh, looks like someone's up to their old tricks, And just in time, too.
Cuidado, espa.
here comes el problema.
Ugh.
i can't tell if it's chili in my pot Or if some kid threw up in here.
And wait it out while an army of highly traine circumstance restores our home.
did you ever hear from serena? Yeah, she left a message saying she was sleeping at poppy's.
Oh, i shouldn't have jumped to conclusions, Been so hard on her.
And jenny should have spoken up sooner.
Lil, i'm really sorry.
And so is she.
i know.
I just think we might be moving a bit fast.
I don't think we should move in together.
I love the idea of our family sharing a place together.
One day.
It's gonna be complicated to say to list We need to find our way and the kids need to find theirs.
We shouldn't let circumstance Impose a time line.
I agree.
but what are you gonna do about dan and yale? We'll figure something out.
Figure out what? What do we need to figure out between me and yale? I'm gonna go get dressed.
Wait.
is that--is that why you were moving in with lily? To pay for my education? Uh what--at happened? Yale has great financial aid.
Well, as of now, we're a low priority.
It's all determined by need.
and It's all relative, dan.
well, what do we do? Well,I'm never let money getting a way Of your education before.
i'm not gonna start now.
We've got some time.
And you need to stay positive about your future.
Did you call that kid who sent you a fan letter? I bet he's dying to hear back from you.
Yeah, well, i mean, it was great of him To reach out like that, so i'll give him a call.
Dan.
We'll figure out a way.
Oh, i-i know.
I should have known it was too good to last.
It's just-- i was having so much fun Hanging out with a normal guy like nate.
We may not have had the drama or the electricity, But you know what we did have? fun? Yes, dorota, fun.
Nate--he's so nice.
Being around him wasn't hard.
It didn't hurt until now.
I miss my friend nate.
Maybe you get happy soon.
True.
The ducks do soothe me.
Give me my loaf.
Mr.
nate called to ask where your favorite spot-- That be where he want first kiss.
Is it true that you brought me here? Well, you ran off too quickly last night, All i want to tell you Is that i do want to be with you Just not like that.
Excuse me.
do i know you? Uh, i don't think so, no.
i met you last year, around this time actually You were with a friend of yours, And you were calling yourself savannah.
Hi.
sorry i'm late.
mmm.
I got some freshments for the ride.
hey! hey! yeah.
Did you two introduce yourselves? uh, not exactly.
It's serena.
I figured.
well, it's nice to meet you again.
i'm gabriel.
Oh, my god.
we're gonna have so much fun.
Hold this.
i gotta get my coat.
Scott! Your phone! Who does, uh, scott know in brooklyn? No one.
Hello? Hey.
is this scott? i'm sorry.
scott can't come to the phone right now Can i give him a message? yeah, this is daniel humphrey.
He wrote me a letter, so, uh, I guess if he wants to talk, Tell him he can-- he can give me a call back.
Certainly.
i'll pass the message along.
Okay.
thank you.
So who was it? Scott wrote a letter to rufus humphrey's son.
Why would he-- He knows.
How do you delete an incoming call? Mistakes, we all make them.
They usually start with the best of intentions, Like keeping a secret to protect someone Ready? i'll be just a second.
Or getting some distance from the person you've become.
Sometimes we don't even know what mistakes we've made to get where we are.
Or we figure it out just in time To make it right again.
But every mistake happens for a reason-- To teach you a lesson you would otherwise never learn You were going to leave without saying good-bye.
I knew you more like me than you were letting on.
Chuck, it's morning now, as in "cold light of," As in "let's pretend last night didn't happen.
" We could just as easily as pretend of this that will happen so.
And hopefully you never make that mistake again.
So we're clear? This is just between us.
It means nothing.
What means nothing? Lucky for me, that never happens
Gossip girl here.
Your one and only source Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
No.
Stop.
Quiet.
Hey! Jenny! Sarah lawrence cannot accept someone who has hazed a teacher.
Colleges stopped accepting applications months ago.
I don't have any other options.
What happened? Yale has great financial aid.
Well,as of now, we're a low priority.
It's all determined by need.
We're not needy enough? It sounds to me like you need to get away.
Yes! Road trip.
I was thinking more like a private jet to spain.
When do we leave? Tomorrow morning.
To espaa! To espaa! I met you last year.
You were calling yourself savannah.
It's serena.
It's nice to meet you again.
I'm gabriel.
All i want to tell you is that i do want to be with you.
And who am i? That's a secret i'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.
O.
X.
O.
,gossip girl.
(Cockney accent) excuse me,sir.
Buy a flower for the pretty lady? You! (British accent) darling,who let this miserable creature in? Please,i'm tryin' to earn money so i can go to yale.
It's my dream,it is, always has been.
Yale? You foolish little girl.
That dream is over.
Time to wake up.
No.
No.
No! No! This is my dream.
No! When you lose hope in a dream, Sometimes all you're left with are sleepless nights.
While some call the doctor for a refill, I find the best solution Is a full social calendar.
And here nate and i are at the young fellows ball.
And here we are with his grandfather, william van der bilt.
Cyrus,focus.
You missed a lot while you were gone.
I'm sorry,but i have an enormous amount to do Before the passover supper tonight--The seder.
Oh,it smells delicious.
Oh,i am making a brisket that is gonna blow your socks off.
Be sure to save me some.
For the last time, This dinner is very important to your stepfather and me.
And if only i could be two people,but you know, Nate's cousin tripp van der bilt is getting married tomorrow.
The dinner's tonight, and i'm late for the rehearsal.
Rehearsal? You're not even in the wedding.
No,but nate texted me, and he said he had a surprise.
I'm betting it's about the junior committee for the whitney.
Tripp's fiance promised to get me on.
Okay,just wait a minute.
Young lady,you are gonna have to get serious about your future.
Maureen is already On the board of four charities and two museums And needs a personal assistant to keep track of her schedule.
Not to mention, Being a socialite was good enough for jackie o.
You know,my old friend,j.
R.
, is a big mugwump at n.
Y.
U.
, And he happens to owe me a favor.
Cyrus saved j.
R.
'S life in 'nam.
Oh.
(Chuckles) well,i'm sorry, but just because i lost yale Does not mean i'm wasting my time at a non-Ivy, Reading "beloved" six times and experimenting with lesbianism.
Now nate is waiting.
Waldorf women are not socialites.
You can just set those down there,please.
The prodigal daughter returns.
How was spain? Amazing.
Perfect.
I'm sure.
You and poppy dancing on tabletops in barcelona, Sunbathing nude in costa del sol.
More like me and poppy and her boyfriend gabriel on the coast.
Uh,i just read and ate and,you know,swam.
So there was nude sunbathing.
Hey,uh,is my mom around? I haven't seen her, but i have been occupied.
Last night's entertainment.
She's a synchronized swimmer, Can hold her breath for five minutes.
So you--You found a way to get over blair then.
Well,there was a detour with a boho barista.
Then i realized i'm a 17-Year-Old billionaire with tremendous stamina.
Tonight i have a date with the bolshoi's lead ballerina.
By the way, i saw poppy lifton at the rose bar last week.
It's funny how she can be there yet still be in spain with you.
Did i tell you you look beautiful? Nate archibald, are you trying to seduce me on church property? Mm.
Come on.
Let's go.
And can you please remind the attendants not to seat me behind caroline kennedy? She may be american royalty, but that woman is a giraffe.
(Chuckles) sure.
Oh,hey.
Tripp asked me to go to lunch with him.
He said it was important, but i think he's just scared i'm gonna talk about his ex-Girlfriends during my toast.
Fine.
I'll come by before dinner.
I-I hope that's not your big surprise.
Oh,yeah.
I'll have to think of a way to thank maureen, With the whitney committee.
I got into columbia.
What? I got into columbia.
What were you talking about? Oh.
Nothing.
That's amazing.
I didn't even know you applied.
Well,i just--I wanted to see if i could get in without any family help, you know.
I mean,all my grandfather had to do to get me into yale Was just make a phone call and i'm sorry.
It's fine.
I'm so happy for you.
So that means no yale? No,honestly,i'm--I'm torn.
Blair.
It was so sweet of you to come.
Yes,it-It's going to be so beautiful.
I-I have some disappointing news.
The whitney junior committee felt you were too new on the scene.
They chose elizabeth instead.
Your bridesmaid? Give it time.
When it comes to these things, It takes a while to start to matter.
Hey,if it makes you feel any better, Maureen had to pick her bridesmaids from a list provided by my grandfather.
Hey,i better go.
The rehearsal's starting.
Oh.
Okay.
I'll just wait here with the rest of the commoners.
Hey.
Hey,wes.
Is that the,uh, science fair project? Yep.
We're tracking air quality on plant growth.
One of these was grown in our apartment, And the other was grown in wes' country house.
Apparently a tree does not grow in brooklyn.
I better take off.
Call you later? Yeah.
Well,i hope for the sake of science that that relationship is strictly professional.
Of course.
But i'm working on it.
No,i get it.
Rent trumps art.
Well,let me know if you change your mind.
Nobody wants to buy art right now.
Look,i'm the one with the expensive yale tuition.
Please let me help.
There's gotta be a job on craigslist that doesn't involve dealing or nudity.
Dan,i have it under control.
Your priority is school.
I'm off to lily's.
She wants to go shopping for a table,a lamp.
I'm not sure.
Bye.
(Jenny) bye.
Good luck.
I don't know he's being so stubborn about this.
You know,wes' mom owns a catering company.
Catering? That definitely was not on the top of my list, But,i mean,yeah, If you--If you-- If you don't mind asking Not at all,because then i can ask him to come to dinner With me as a thanks for being so cool to my brother.
Hello,blair.
Good to see you.
You,too, mr.
Van der bilt.
The wedding is going to be lovely.
Blair, it's reached my ears that nate has been accepted to columbia.
Has he spoken to you of his intentions? Not in so many words.
But i do know he's very proud of having gotten in on his own.
As he should be.
My grandson values your opinion.
Perhaps you could show him that yale is the appropriate choice.
I think this is a decision he needs to make himself.
Tell me,what are your plans for next year? I know you put off college.
Any word from the junior committee for the whitney? Actually they didn't accept me.
Ah.
I think that must be some kind of mistake.
I'll call agnes chismer immediately and clear that right up.
Really? For a friend of my grandson, there's nothing i wouldn't do.
Yale is an amazing school.
And nate would look dashing in bulldog blue.
And i want to be a bridesmaid.
I think,uh,she might have room for one more.
Why did i give dorota the weekend off? Ever since she and vanya fell in love, All she thinks about is herself.
Hello? Yes,this is cyrus rose.
This is serena van der woodsen.
? How did antique shopping turn into shoe shopping? Well,my darling, All shopping eventually leads to shoe shopping.
If only people felt that way about art.
You're thinking about dan's tuition.
(Sighs) uh,mid-Range collectors just aren't buying right now.
Well,you never know when things will turn around.
(Gasps) Now who says that these are not art Hey,mom.
Nice shoes.
Could you give us a moment? Welcome back.
Thanks.
Mom,i know you're upset.
No,i'm furious.
First you trash the apartment, then you run away to spain.
I'm sorry.
I,um,i've just-- I've been feeling really lost.
Oh,spare me,serena.
The only thing that is lost is Your sense of responsibility and consideration.
It seems to me like the old serena is back, And i'm not very happy to see her.
So you might want to take your coat off, Because you're grounded.
S.
! You're back from spain! (Serena) yeah.
I just landed.
Hey,uh,are you home? No.
More like avoiding it.
My mom and cyrus are hosting passover.
I thought firstborns were supposed to be spared.
Oh,so--So you're not gonna be at the apartment all day? I'm getting a dress fitted at reem acra, And then nate and i are going to his cousin's rehearsal dinner.
S.
, i'm one of the chosen ones.
I was wandering the bass-Ian desert And now i've reached the van der bilt promised land.
That's great.
Um,listen, i have to run some errands, But let's talk later,okay? I thought maureen was only having five bridesmaids.
It was kind of last minute.
And i think a little higher on the hem.
(Grunts) so i'm gonna need a couple minutes to practice my tray balancing.
I've never done this before.
Although i have a feeling i-I'll be a tray-Balancing wunderkind.
Are you gonna do this nervous talking thing all night? It's cool.
I just need to know.
No,i'm sorry.
I-I didn't tell my dad i took this job, And i-I feel so bad keeping it from him, But,you know, he gets so defensive.
I'll take that as a "yes.
" Oh,no,no,no,no.
Good.
You're here.
I just ran out to buy some candles.
I don't understand why we just can't light some votives.
You look familiar.
Have you worked for me before? I did call them,and they cannot send over a replacement.
They are absolutely overextended.
Mrs.
Waldorf,i'm sure that between corrine And--And dorota dorota has the weekend off.
And i absolutely need two servers.
Cyrus' mother's coming, and she hates me.
I have never thrown a seder before.
I don't even know how to say half the words in this prayer book that's named for lieberman's wife.
She,uh,she's hadassah.
The--I think the prayer book is called haggadah.
See? No,you cannot leave.
With all due respect, i-I don't-- I don't feel comfortable serving knishes to blair.
But blair won't be here.
And you don't serve knishes at passover.
I'll double your pay For both of you.
I could really use the money.
(Sighs) fine.
Great.
Here are the linens.
Put one of these at every place.
Cyrus? Cyrus,i think the brisket's burnin'.
Oh,no.
Not at all, mrs.
Chismer.
We all make mistakes.
Hi.
So i'll see you tuesday at the whitney? So I've been thinking about this whole college thing.
I'm going to columbia.
Okay.
Oh,maybe it's just my old prejudice speaking, Yale only accepted me because of my grandfather.
I don't want to owe him or my family anything.
After tonight, we're done with them.
Oh,b.
, too bad you weren't invited To nate and tripp's lunch, 'cause whatever happened, It looks like you're the one paying.
Cyrus! Your mother's here.
God,where is that man? I can certainly look into the legalities of it, But i think you should tell your mother.
We're--We're not in a good place right now.
I don't think i could go up to her and say, "Sorry,but i sort of got married in spain.
"But don't worry.
Cyrus is helping me get a quickie annulment.
" She's your mother.
Sh-- ? ? Two days into the trip, Poppy and gabriel get in this huge fight, And then she just leaves, abandoning me and gabriel.
And so i-I stayed around to keep him company.
Well,you did a bang-Up job.
Dan,please.
Gabriel and poppy were over, And it's not like either one of us planned this.
This--This thing between us just happened, And we couldn't stop it.
This "thing" was a marriage.
What were you thinking? I don't know.
I-I wasn't.
But i don't even know if i am married.
That's what cyrus is trying to figure out.
How does one not know if one is married? Well,there was a dinner, And then we had a lot of rioja And then dancing and then more rioja And then we took off our clothes and went swimming in the ocean.
Okay,skip that part.
Yeah.
Yeah,um, so--So the next thing i know, Gabriel is just screaming, "i love you! I love you!" And he's banging on this church door, Trying to wake up a priest and-- O-Okay--Okay,so there was a priest.
Did you say "i do"? Well,i-I said "s?> I don't know.
It w-Was all in spanish.
It was--It was crazy.
You're smiling.
What? You ran off to spain with a guy you barely know.
You got married and you're-- A little bit--You're smiling.
No,i woke up the next morning, And i thought,"what have i done? This is crazy.
" And i got on the next flight out and here i am talking to cyrus.
You're a--You're like-- You're a wife.
No,i'm not.
Maybe i am.
A-Are you jealous? Serena,we were together for a year, And we didn't make it to junior prom.
You're with this guy for less than a month, And you get married, so i mean,yeah, It's a little bit insulting.
I-I have to-- I have to get back to work.
Wait.
Wait.
Are you serving eleanor's seder? No.
Sort of.
I mean,yes.
Yes You're the wife of the landed gentry, And i'm a cater waiter at a seder.
Dan,wait.
* i've got a man who's always late * * any time we have a date * but i love him Nate, tell me what's going on.
It's fine.
Listen,i'm just-- I'm just glad you're here,okay? You know, now might not be a good time To say anything to your grandfather about columbia.
Well,that should be easy,since i'm not gonna speak to him.
* and i'm gonna have him * Is there a problem,blair? No.
No problem.
I just need a few more minutes.
Oh,eleanor, thank you for doing this.
Please.
I was very happy that you invited yourself.
(Whispers) cyrus' mother-- She hates me.
(Normal voice) another friendly face is always welcome.
Hello,rufus.
(Blows kiss) hey.
Oh,do you know that You'll find out.
That's allan levy, the art collector.
He's the guy who put a monet in his bathroom.
I--Oh,no.
Well,he's an old friend of cyrus'.
You've been saying the mid-Range art market is dead,so i thought it might be nice for you to meet a few high-End collectors.
Lil,i appreciate you trying to help, But i am not fawning over an ass like allan levy just to make a sale.
Oh,god.
Dan,what are you doing here? (Sighs) um,i'm j-- I'm just here 'cause-- Because i invited him.
Oh.
Lovely.
I'm sorry that i snuck out,mom, but i had to see blair.
She invited me to seder, so i invited dan.
Though blair is now strangely nowhere to be seen.
Well,lucky for you, I don't want to cause a scene at eleanor's.
We'll talk about this later.
Dan,you're dressed just like a cater waiter.
Yeah,well,y-You go for a classic look with a black tie And a white shirt, and that's what you get.
Serena, what are you doing here? Blair invited her.
Strange.
Blair made it absolutely clear that she wasn't going to be here,but please stay.
Daniel,would you go downstairs and get the kosher wine And could you please make yourself a little more presentable? That was sorta rude.
Yeah,you know what? I'm just gonna go with it.
Attaboy.
Drinks? Yeah.
I would have invited you to the loft, But the only chef we have there is my dad, And his specialties are waffles and embarrassing me.
Do you want the top hat or the race car? What,do you want the shoe? This isn't the same girl i used to see hanging out on the steps of the met.
Yeah,well,people change.
Great.
Good evening.
If you hear screams, don't be alarmed.
We're fine.
I think i'll be the thimble.
Rufus' gallery is in williamsburg.
You should move your gallery to the city.
Williamsburg is already over.
I didn't realize a whole neighborhood could be over.
My friends,it's time for the seder to begin.
Dan,uh,i need you to know that i'm really sorry.
Dan,we need matzo! Serena,being eleanor's bitch boy is about all i can take right now,so i (chuckles) I really don't need your pity.
Okay,but just please understand that what happened Between me and gabriel has nothing to do with you.
Uh,yeah,sure.
But a person doesn't just go off and suddenly get married.
You're clearly reacting to something.
(Eleanor) dan! I gotta get matzo.
* whatever lola wants Tripp.
Blair.
Did you say something to nate? He feels lucky,you know, that you two are back together.
He told me how much you've both changed.
Is that true? Yes.
Of course.
We've changed a lot.
Well,be good to him,okay? What did you tell him? Well,good evening.
Oh,no.
Most of you know me.
I'm nate archibald, tripp's cousin.
When tripp asked me to be the best man in his wedding, I was a little bit surprised, to say the least.
But i guess grandfather told him to choose me And that was that,so (laughter) But we all know how important family is to william van der bilt.
But what we don't know are the many secret ways he helps us all out.
For instance, today i discovered He was the one who had my father investigated by the authorities.
(Scoffs) and if he cares so much about family, Then why did he destroy mine? So i guess the lesson here Tripp,old buddy Is watch your back.
To family.
Uh-Oh,b.
Looks like you hitched your wagon to a falling star.
Can i help you? Yes,i'm gabriel.
I'm looking for serena.
Baruch atah ay dios mio.
? The jewish people's flight from slavery to freedom.
(Whispering) you need to come to the foyer.
Dan,i know you're upset, But now is not a good time.
Cyrus is about to pray.
we light the candles.
You really need to come out there,like,right now.
Normally we do this before sunset, But i won't tell if you don't.
Excuse me.
What is so important? Oh,no.
Exactly.
Gabriel,wh-What-- What are you doing here? How can you ask me that? I woke up and you were gone.
Not even a note.
But how did you even find me? I called your apartment.
The guy who answered said you'd probably be here.
He also asked me if i had any hash.
This is obviously between the two of you,so no,you're not leaving.
Please.
I can call you, But you have to go now.
No,i'm not going anywhere.
We have to talk.
You owe me at least that.
Please,gabriel,don't.
Why won't you even talk to me? I mean,after everything that we've-- Because dan is my boyfriend.
We got in a fight Before i left for spain, and once i got there, I got a little carried away, But no matter what, i-I had to come back.
Dan was my first love, and nothing can change that.
Yeah,it,uh,it's true.
It's true.
I love serena.
No matter what crazy thing she does, Uh,i-I will always love her.
I'm sorry,but,serena, You've--You've never mentioned him before.
Well,i'm sure i had to come up at least once.
At any point? Gabriel,i will call you, but y-You do have to leave.
This is a family dinner.
Dan,cyrus says that we are missing a lamb bone.
Oh,hello.
Is this another one of your friends? Yeah,um,sort of, but he's leaving.
I apologize.
I didn't mean to interrupt your evening.
Oh,not at all,not at all.
Would you like to join us? We're having a seder.
No,no,i'm sure he can't.
No,no.
I'd love to meet the people in serena's life.
Perhaps it'll help me better understand her.
Wonderful.
There's even an empty seat.
It's for elijah, but you can take it.
You are in serious danger of losing your tip.
(Flo rida and kesha) * when you go down,when you go down * (Flo rida) * hey,walk out my house with my swagger * Did you know about this? What? No,of course not.
You have five minutes to fix it.
Did you really turn in the captain? Before you take a stand on principle, Remember what you have at stake.
Or do you plan to spend next year sewing buttons at your mother's atelier? Now go.
* then pop in the next and this mix will be ours * Then we eat the afikomen, Say the blessing after the meal, Sing a few songs, and then we're done.
So as soon as everyone has some wine,we'll begin.
Wait.
We haven't started.
Uh,i'm sorry.
Are you the gabriel as in the gabriel that was in spain with poppy and my daughter? Yes.
In fact-- Cyrus,this wine is delicious.
Oh,well,thank you,dear.
We're not supposed to drink it until the blessing, But,uh,we'll make an exception this time.
Rufus,do you represent any artists worth my attention? All of my artists are worth attention.
Otherwise i wouldn't represent them.
* hey,shawty must know i'm the man * * my money love her Why is he serving the wine? Isn't he supposed to be He is just helpful.
That's all.
Dan,baby,um,come sit down right here next to me,please.
Oh,well,that's where we just moved elijah.
But never mind.
Eleanor,you don't mind if he joins us,do you? At this point,why not? We're not eating any time soon.
* "damn it,i know you," you wanna shoot * Oh,no.
You two haven't-- Now we will say the kiddush, or prayer for the first cup.
I'll say this in english because as i look around this table, I see that most of our guests are not speakers of hebrew.
You've got to be kidding me.
(Cyrus) we praise you, adonai,our god, Ruler of the universe,who creates the fruit of the vine * ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found * * it's goin' down,down * * from the top of the pole, i watch her go down * * she got me throwin' my money around * What? Do you not like? Have we done this before? I thought you'd remember.
Last year, after sleeping beauty I need to get a drink.
No! Ugh.
Yes! Not again.
That takes you right to my property--Marvin gardens.
Pay up.
What a shock.
The girl from brooklyn's a renter.
Don't you have a guest to attend to? It appears i already did, a year ago.
I probably should have noticed in the elevator.
How many women can put their legs behind their hey,um,do you wanna go for a walk? Okay.
Sure.
I'll just meet you at the elevator.
Okay.
You know,just 'cause you're bored with your own life Doesn't mean you have to make everyone around you miserable.
For your information, you don't live here yet.
(Scoffs) please.
After what you did at the kiss on the lips party last year, Like i would ever live in the same house as you.
You know,you're lucky i didn't tell my dad, Because if i did,he'd make lily choose--Us or you-- And i wonder who she'd pick.
Do you really think i care if lily kicks me out? Yeah,i do, because you lost blair, And now she's dating your best friend.
So therefore the only human contact that you have that you don't pay for is the people in this house.
Knowing you, you'll screw that up,too.
Are you coming back? You can let yourself out.
Nate.
Blair,i'm i'm so sorry.
I should have told you.
It's fine.
Are you okay? Yeah.
I mean,no,i'm not.
You know,i trusted him.
I mean,was i wrong? No.
You're wonderful.
I'm gonna go get my coat.
Then we can go.
Okay.
Nathaniel.
I did turn your father in, But only after i confronted him and begged him to stop.
When he denied it to my face, I warned him that i would take action.
Finally To prevent further damage to you and your mother, I called the s.
E.
C.
And i'd do it again.
Why couldn't you have just told me this? Is that what you want, nathaniel--The truth? Yes.
I'm just so tired of people lying to me and going behind my back.
Okay.
Let's start again.
Nothing but the truth.
But in that case, There's something you should know.
Watch out,b.
It seems like just when you got it right, ? That was the washing of the hands, Also called the title 88 of the new york city health code.
Next we have the dipping of the vegetable.
You mean we're finally going to get to eat something? Oh,yes,parsley.
So are you two really together again? (Cyrus) so if,uh,corrine would get everyone The salt water for dipping-- Wait.
I'm sorry.
Why doesn't everybody Seem to know the two of you are back together? And what kind of daughter doesn't-- Shh.
There's praying about to happen.
But--I'm so sorry,cyrus-- When did that's fine.
When did this happen? You just broke up two months ago.
I thought you said you broke up right before spain.
Mm.
It's complicated.
Eleanor's friends are talking during the seder.
They're both of our friends, mother.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I-I just don't believe he's your boyfriend.
First of all, he's dressed like a waiter.
I think it's kind of a classic look.
Well,he is my boyfriend, And we are very happy together.
Serena-- I am so sorry,cyrus.
No.
No.
Go right ahead.
What is going on? I-I'm a cater waiter.
And not a very good one.
Wait.
What? I didn't want you to know, So--So we were pretending that we're back together.
She's just trying to be a good friend,really.
I'm mrry.
Apology accepted.
Now take your parsley Where's corrine with the salt water? Hold on.
I'm--I'm sorry.
Is this you trying to help with college? I know you didn't want me to,dad, But i-I couldn't do nothing.
By the way,serena and i may not be together, But i do care about her very much.
Now who needs more wine? Serena,a word? (Cyrus) all right, we'll skip the bitter herbs.
Uh,moving on to the matzo.
Hey,you know what? I'm,uh,i need some air.
I'm gonna walk home,so you just--Just go ahead,okay? Nate,what's wrong? I'm proud of what you did back there.
I thought you were,too.
Did you tell my grandfather You would convince me to go to yale In exchange for him making you a bridesmaid? I can explain.
That's great,you know? First my grandfather sells my father out, And then you sell me out for a picture in the style section.
No.
But i didn't! I mean,god,i did, But then i realized when he asked me again-- No,you know what? I actually thought this time would be different.
But you're just--You're just the same girl you always were.
No,i'm not! I I was just scared about next year and us.
Nate,please give me another chance.
I want to trust you.
Okay? But I can't think of a single reason why i should.
The car will take you home.
So this is how it's going to be? The day is not even over, and you've already defied me about your grounding, Caused a scene at eleanor's seder-- It wasn't a scene.
Yes,it was,right out of the old serena playbook.
You could have thrown in a few boys from the lacrosse team, And it would have been the constance mother-Daughter luncheon all over again.
(Sighs) you have been so good the last two years.
Well,i can't live like that anymore.
Why not? Mom,i know that i have hurt you and eric and blair.
I've done a lot of things that i'm not proud of, And i don't wanna go back to that,but it wasn't all bad.
I miss the good parts.
I miss feeling free, Feeling like i can do something just because i want to, And there has to be a balance.
Well,of course there does.
But if every time i make a mistake, You look at me like i'm a bad person, Then how am i supposed to find that? Oh,sweetheart,i could never think of you as a bad person.
You got into brown.
The letter came while you were away.
I got into brown? Yeah.
Congratulations.
And i do trust you.
I got into brown.
Yes.
Now what are you gonna do about gabriel? What do you mean? Oh,please.
He was a little too upset about dan to,um,be just a friend.
I don't know.
I,um,i like him, But it's kind of a mess.
Sometimes those messes can be fun.
I'm sorry.
If you're talking about that hot guy from dinner, He just left.
Gabriel.
Gabriel.
You wanted me to leave.
I left.
I'm sorry that i lied, but you scared me, Showing up here like that.
I am just not ready to be married.
Is that what you think is going on? Well,yeah, We were in a church, and there was a priest.
At least i think he was a priest.
I don't know.
I drank a lot of rioja,but of course we're not married.
I don't even know if that was the priest i woke up.
It could have been the gardener.
R really? Really.
We were just having fun, doing something crazy.
Oh,i,um Wow.
Well,that's a relief.
So that waiter's not your boyfriend? No.
What about me? Serena.
Ah,cruel fate.
Just as serena van der woodsen is falling in love, Blair waldorf is falling apart.
(Sighs) look,i told you, I'm not in the mood.
Good.
Neither am i.
Was it stupid of me to think blair changed? Yes.
So she's just The way she is.
I mean,it's stupid for you to want her to be anything other than she is.
Anyway,blair is changing.
How do you know? Because she could have had me.
She chose you.
Now she just needs someone to believe in her.
Time for a refill.
Hey.
I'll get it.
Thanks.
Your father and i are heading out, And i know what you were trying to do for serena.
You're a good friend.
I'm not a very good cater waiter.
But i'm a good salesman.
You sold allan levy a painting.
It also gave me an idea of something else i should sell-- The gallery.
Oh,rufus.
Dad,come on.
When i started out, i was selling to young couples, Kids who had no money but loved art, And somehow, over time,that changed.
And tonight i realized i just don't love doing this anymore.
And if i'm really honest, I haven't for some time.
Oh,well,okay.
What are you gonna do? I'm not sure.
But i'm excited to find out.
(Laughs) see you at home.
I can't believe i sold out nate to be the next jackie o.
Yeah,i always pictured you as the next hillary.
Except i'd win.
What am i gonna do? I don't know.
You'll figure something out.
Besides,who wants to be on the junior committee for the whitney anyway? Do you think i care about that? I lost nate.
I deserve to be alone.
And who was that tall snack you were devouring outside? Oh,uh,that is A long story.
Blair? There is someone downstairs who wants to speak with you.
I was pretty awful to cyrus this morning.
I should go apologize.
B.
,i'm really happy to be home.
Archibald.
* i was feeling sad * can't help looking back * * highways flew by * run,run away * no sense of time * like you to stay * want to keep you inside Hey.
I thought my dad would be here, We're supposed to meet up to go home.
How was your date? Good.
Great,actually.
I never apologized for what happened last year.
I deeply regret my actions of that night.
If you ever do move in here I'll make sure i'm not around.
* run,run away * no sense of time * like you to stay * want to keep you inside Cyrus.
I apologize about missing the seder And being so snotty about n.
Y.
U.
Can you forgive me? Well,that's why god invented yom kippur.
And when you said you could call in a favor at n.
Y.
U Did you mean it? Well,i carried j.
R.
On my back for five hours through the jungle.
But i can only get you an interview.
It's gonna be up to you to wow him.
Thank you.
Sounds like we'll both be in the city.
Nate? Yes.
Well,who did you think i was talking about? Blair,i,uh i'm so sorry.
* not so strong without these open arms * * hold on tight * i'm * * not that strong without these open arms * (Gabriel) this is gabriel.
Leave a message.
(Beep) Hey,gabriel.
It's me.
Uh,i-I just wanted to say That i don't know what's gonna happen with us,but,um I'm really glad you came back for me.
Okay.
Um,that's it.
I-I will talk to you tomorrow.
On passover,we ask, why is it that this night Is different from any other night? (Vibrating) But who are we kidding? So Tell me everything.
Tonight's no different from the rest.
These things always happen around here.
Shalom,gossip girl.
Gossip Girl here Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I actually thought this time would be different But you're just the same girl you always were.
It's stupid for you to want her to be anything other than she is.
NoW she just needs someone to believe in her.
Dan was denied financial aid at Yale.
I mean, I could help you out I think this is something I have to handle on my own.
I'm Gabriel.
Gabriel and Poppy were over.
And it's not like either one of us planned this.
This-- this thing between us just happened, - And we couldn't stop it.
Would you like to join us? I'd love to meet the people in Serena's life.
Eventually, every queen finds herself In unfamiliar territory outside the castle walls.
In Blair Waldorf's case-- the Village.
NYU? Ugh, what was I thinking? You know how I feel about ironic facial hair.
Well, you were thinking "A," you're lucky to get into a school at all, And "B," you're super lucky 'cause where you got in happens to be in the same city as your - Fantastic boyfriend - That's true I've been coming down here for years, And I'm gonna teach you everything you need to know-- The best latte, the best slice, the best pot dealer.
But first, the most important lesson of all-- How to ride the subway.
Nate, you're sweet But obviously, you've inhaled too much patchouli.
There's no way I'm going down there.
It's full of mole men and middle-class professionals.
Well, you have to learn.
How else are you gonna visit me at Columbia? Why do you think God gave us car service? Our schools are at opposite poles of Manhattan.
I mean, in traffic, it could take hours.
The subway's definitely the quickest way.
Please don't ask this stuff to me.
Anything you want, Dan.
You're graduating high school, that's a big deal.
How about a trunk? Trunks are great for storage.
Books-- you're gonna have a lot of books at college.
Hey, Jenny, maybe you need a trunk too.
Any one you want.
Dad, what's with this newfound interest in antiquing? Oh, I'm just stimulating the economy by rewarding my fantastic kids, And it so happens that the, uh, gallery was a great investment It's listing for three times what I paid for it.
You didn't get sold when the real estate bubble burst? Well, it's not as much as I would've gotten at the top of the market, but I'll be able to send you both to school and have a little breathing room to figure out what I want to do next Setting up cooking classes I mean, even I'm getting tired of your waffles, Not cool.
I sometimes make chili.
It looks a little delicate for your hand.
Don't get any ideas, big shot.
I'm just looking.
It's Lily.
One sec.
Check out what dad was looking at.
Rats go underground.
Not Waldorfs.
Well, you can always borrow Chuck's helicopter.
Kidding.
Chuck what a waste of time that was.
You know, it's not a real relationship If you can't hold hands.
Oh, but Nate is good to me.
Good for me.
And he's learned a thing or two.
So being a kept man does have its perks.
Yeah, but no man is worth suffering the indignity of mass transit.
How's the foreigner? Blair, Gabriel is from North Carolina.
That's in the United States.
Not by choice.
Let me remind you of a little thing called the Civil War.
Everything with Gabriel is perfect.
No strings, no demands Except he is so focused on building his new company That he can never commit to anything-- Dinner reservations, movies.
Sometimes, he'll get a text for a meeting, and then, poof, he's gone.
Well, if it's casual like you said No strings then what do you expect? It's not like you're gonna marry the guy I kinda did marry him.
We got carried away.
I talked to Cyrus.
It doesn't count Let me get this straight.
He goads you into making the ultimate commitment, And now he can't stick it out through a whole dinner? He didn't goad me.
It was romantic.
Gabriel is disappearing for a reason.
We need to get to the bottom of it.
No, we don't.
Oh, come on! Let's follow him tonight.
We can dress up, use code names.
Dorota is a great help with surveillance equipment.
Doesn't that sound at all fun? No, not even a smidgen.
So what exactly are you guys doing tonight? No.
Well, you suck more than usual today.
A little distracted.
Things with-- - It's okay.
You can say her name.
Blair.
I feel weird talking about her with you.
Nathaniel, she's your girlfriend.
If we want to be friends like we were, It's just part of the deal.
So it's okay to just talk about her guy to guy Like we used to? Well, I was there for you last week, wasn't it? Yeah, you were.
I think next year's gonna be harder than I thought, you know, with me in morningside heights and her all the way down in the Village, It's basically like we're in a long-distance relationship.
Well, it's too bad you don't have a place In the middle, like my room at the palace.
Just say a word, and she can crash with me.
That's not funny.
You're right.
I'm sorry.

  But, Archibald, let's face it
You won.
I lost.
You have nothing to worry about with me.
I'm out of that game.
Well, I certainly don't have to worry about your weak-ass jumper, do I? And then my grandfather says, "If it's menthol you want, it's menthol you're gonna get.
" I didn't know your family was in the tobacco industry.
Yeah, they are.
But Gabriel doesn't want anything to do with it.
They were grooming me to take over, But I had to break out on my own and do something positive.
So I started researching new technologies And found a company that wants to provide wireless access to the developing world, so I've been backing them.
I mean, it sounds like such a good thing, But to my family, it is betrayal.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that Family is so important.
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, I asked the caterer for a '99 Brunello.
This isn't a PTA meeting.
Though nothing's as important as the right wine.
Look, I apologize.
I'm hosting the co-op meeting tomorrow, And it'll be an hour-long battle over lobby renovations, Followed by cocktails and appetizers.
You're welcome to join us.
Keep Serena company.
Oh, yes, please do.
I'd be honored.
Hey, who's up for a movie? Yeah.
Yes.
Do you know what? That sounds lovely, but I'm sorry, honey.
I have some work to do.
So this has been great, thank you very much.
But I'm afraid I have to go.
Gabriel, it's a movie.
You know, most of 'em are only, like, 80 minutes these days.
And you know that there's nothing else I'd rather do, But I'm a little behind on reviewing the prospectus.
This is important to me.
Yeah, and you spending time with my family - Is important to me.
My deal will be closed soon, And then I'm all yours, I promise.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll get my coat.
Blair.
I see you're wearing your beret.
Who are we spying on tonight? Serena's shady southerner.
Well, I can't say he does much for me, either.
But why the intrigue? Don't tell me Not enough drama in domestic bliss with Nate? You know, when people step outside their relationship for a thrill It's usually not alone and in the dark.
I happen to be worried about my best friend.
Serena said Gabriel just disappears.
Poof! Well, I'm gonna find out where he's poofing to.
And besides, it's good for couples to have different interests.
This feels eerily familiar.
Shut up! Look.
Poppy? And when a queen discovers her best maiden is with a dragon in disguise The only thing to do is pull up the drawbridge and trap him.
Metaphorically, of course.
You have to dump him! We caught that redneck red-handed.
Well, B.
, obviously I'm not thrilled, But I'm gonna get to the bottom of this on my own.
Now why can't you worry about your own relationship problems for a change? - What does that supposed to mean? - It was friday night, And you were out spying on my boyfriend, Instead of seeing a movie or something.
Why can't anybody see a movie around here? I have to call you later.
Serena, there's something you should know.
Last night I was Spying on that boyfriend of Serena's.
Philanderer! - Chuck and I saw him with Poppy.
Wait.
Chuck? You were with Chuck? Yeah, we ran into each other outside the building.
It's not a big deal.
You know that, right? Yeah.
of course.
It's no big deal.
Good, because unlike some people we know Serena We have a relationship without secrets or lying.
Yeah, I know.
We're really lucky.
Good.
Ready to go have lunch? - Sure.
Are you sleeping with her? No.
No.
Not since I met you.
I told her that I just needed space And time to think.
But the truth is, I-- I'd just like to never see her again.
You know, when I first came to New York, I didn't know many people.
And all the investors in my company are her contacts.
And when she found out about us, she threatened to pull them So I told her that you and I were over.
If she found out the truth I could lose-- I could lose everything.
Do you hate me? No, I don't hate you.
But I hate lying.
And you lied to me.
And you lied to Poppy despite everything she is still my friend and I care about her I didn't plan on falling love with you Gabriel, you--you have to tell her about us.
I can't.
You know how jealous she is.
And I've spent two years developing this company.
It's-- it's everything to me.
It's finallty the chance to be free from my parents.
By tying yourself to Poppy? I've done the 2-girlfriends thing.
I can't do that again.
Listen, these contracts will be done in one week.
And after that, I promise you I will tell her everything.
Trust me.
The money she'll make, it'll cushion the blow.
As long as it's not physical, Then I I guess I can live with it.
But only for a week.
I mean it.
Okay.
Believe me, I only have eyes for one girl.
And she is the most exquisite thing I've ever seen.
So am I not supposed to mention the outfit? I'm a cater waiter now.
Where've you been? Just working.
Okay.
Well, I was hoping to never speak about this, But it might actually feel good to.
Oh, hey, there you guys are.
So have you told her about the ring yet? Ring? What ring? We caught our dad eyeing one yesterday.
A ring ring? Oh, my god.
Wait.
This is good news, right? Well, I mean, he-- he looked.
He didn't buy.
He chickened out.
Why? Maybe because Jenny basically told him she'd never move in with the V.
D.
dubs.
Okay, or he's worried about Dan having slept - With his maybe stepsister.
Well, I hope that's not it, 'cause there's really zero chance of Serena and I ever getting back together.
So you guys are okay with it.
Yeah, well, it'd be weird-- dad marrying Lily.
Sharing bunk beds with Chuck.
Yeah, I mean, it would defenitely be weird.
But, I don't know, you should've seen dad yesterday.
I mean, he was practically skipping.
I don't think I've ever seen him this happy.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone that happy.
Then you should tell him you support him.
No, that's not-- that can't be right.
That's not what we dis-discussed it.
That's, uh - Dad? Uh, no.
No, no, no.
I won't hav Though maybe not today.
Let me get this straight.
Gabriel is still popping Poppy, And you're okay with that? No, no, this is too m.
o.
b.
Go put on the Vena Cava.
For the hundredth time, He's not still sleeping with her.
And while it's not ideal, He is gonna break up with her next week.
And what proof did he offer of that? He doesn't need proof, B.
, Because I trust him.
We have this amazing connection.
Do you know he said he fell in love with me the first time he ever saw me? Oh, that is interesting, considering the fact That he was on vacation with his girlfriend.
Actually, the first time he saw me was a year ago When I was out with Georgina.
He busted me on my fake southern accent And what night was that? Don't tell me it was that night-- That night that you blacked out and don't remember anything? He fell in love with you while you were roofied.
How romantic.
No, no, no.
It wasn't like that.
He said I was completely lucid.
It must've been before Georgina drugged me.
I just don't happen to remember it.
Believe me, I had to learn the hard way.
Trust is the most important thing in a relationship and we have that The way I trust Nate and he trusts me? Even though he may as well be going to school in Guam next year I wouldn't worry if I can't find him Because I know he'll always be true to me.
I hope so, B.
Because, no offense, but we both know that that hasn't always been the case.
What are you saying, that Nate is in love with you? What are you saying, that Gabriel isn't? No.
I'm just saying he's not gonna break up with Poppy.
Why would he? He's having her cake and eating yours, too Ok, right, so both Nate and Chuck are obsessed with you, But my boyfriend can't stay faithful - To me for seven days? - No, that's I love you.
I just don't want to see you get hurt, okay? Go put that back on.
It was beautiful on you.
Oh, Vanessa.
I thought you left with Dan and Jenny.
I was just about to close up.
You-- you can go home now.
Figure I'll savor my moments here while I can.
Gonna miss this place.
Yeah, well, it, uh, looks like your job will be safe - For quite a while.
What do you mean? The real estate agent hasn't received one call about the place.
She thinks it might be months before we find a buyer.
It's the market.
That's why you were so upset earlier.
Is there a plan "B"? Yeah, last year, after the tour, a music publishing company offered to buy The Lincoln Hawk catalog.
You're gonna sell your life's work? Yes.
And, apparently, now that we're not touring, it isn't even worth what it was last year.
You know, I stopped touring to spend time with my family.
It turns out it might've been the worst thing I could've done for them.
I'm sorry.
This isn't your burden.
Hey, let's get outta here.
Archibald, what are we doing here? This place is great, but Murray Hill? Even your mother's too hip for this zip code.
It's for me.
It's halfway between NYU and Columbia.
I just figured I'd lease this so I could be close to Blair next year.
Well, congratulations, but couldn't you have told me this over the phone? You're my friend, all right? I brought you here as my friend.
To show you I found a solution to my problem.
Okay, friend.
I hope you'll be very happy here.
I just wanted to show you that Blair and I are really serious now.
You understand that, right? She told you about our little run-in last night.
You told me you'd back off.
I did and will continue to do so.
Last night was nothing.
We ran into each other on the street.
It was no big deal.
With you two, it's always a big deal.
We just have to be clear with each other.
I want you to know that Blair and I are in a good place.
What place is that? Some tacky apartment where you can keep your eye on her? No, that's not the reason I got-- If you needed to mark your territory so badly, Nathaniel, Maybe you should just pee on her.
I don't want you to go near her again I mean that.
It's Blair.
I think I'll take this one outside.
I thought if I proved the North Caro-liar Was cheating with his ex, that would be it, But she fell for his business meeting excuse.
Monkey business, more likely.
With Serena and Poppy both fighting over the banana.
I'm really worried, Chuck.
You know how Serena is.
she gets in over her head.
We need to expose this two-timer for what he is.
So what do you say, Bass? One last mission? By any chance, do you have Poppy Lifton's phone number? Queen of hearts or queen of heartache? Careful, B.
, Cut off the head of one love triangle, One of your own may grow back in its place.
And that concludes our co-op business at this time And now the real reason you came, the refreshments you and I simply have not had time to bond Come, we'll walk Blair where are we going? - On a tour.
Of my house? I've been here before.
First, we'll start with Serena's room.
While I appreciate you playing the peacemaker, Chuck, I'm not sure Serena will want to see me.
Trust me, this should be exciting for everyone.
And this is serena's dresser Where she keeps all her pajamas and peignoirs.
But maybe you've already been in there.
Blair, what are you doing? Poppy.
Gabriel.
Nice.
I knew it.
Poppy, I know.
we-- we need to talk.
What do you want to talk about? The fact that you stole my boyfriend? I didn't steal him.
You left You know what? Don't.
'Cause it's not even you that I'm mad at.
It's him.
You are a lying, cheating-- I am gonna kill you! No one's killing anyone.
It's a co-op cocktail party.
What an idiot I am! Using my connections for your company? Poppy, it is not like that.
You know it's not.
Then leave with me right now.
And if you don't, I will call every investor And tell them to take their money back.
Poppy, you and I are done.
Things haven't been good with us for a long time.
And I'm sorry.
Serena didn't steal me.
She swept me away.
You tell your investors whatever you want.
Fine.
I'll tell them the truth.
That you're ruined.
Goodbye, Gabriel Gabriel I'm sorry.
I just I need a minute to clear my head.
I guess he really likes you.
At least now we know.
I'll deal with you later.
Hello.
Since when did my apartment become your watering hole of choice? Rufus and Jenny let me in on their way out.
I thought I'd wait for you, Maybe play a little "I never.
" I kind of already started.
Yeah, I can see that.
I'll go first.
All right.
I never slept with Chuck Bass.
That's why I've been avoiding you.
I know.
It's repulsive.
It is Completely repulsive, but you didn't-- But you--you--you--you've been going through a lot lately.
I mean, the whole Blair-Nate reunion and all, and Plus the whole "looking up while looking down" thing Really had a certain appeal to it.
So you--you get no judgment from me.
Everyone makes a mistake at least once.
I never nearly slept with Georgina Sparks.
I never slept with Chuck Bass twice.
Dan, you're lucky.
However bad your life sucks right now, You didn't need an STD panel this week.
Oh, yeah, there's that.
Wait, why does my life suck right now? So you going to Lily's now? Yeah, the co-op meeting should be done by now.
There's a party after.
You should come.
No offense.
That sounds really boring, Especially with Eric being out of town.
So, uh You kinda haven't been yourself tonight.
All day, actually.
I mean, is everything all right? I'm just a little tired, but I'm fine.
You're not.
And I know why.
Jenny, whatever you think you know-- I know that you want to propose to Lily.
And I want you to know that Dan and I are totally okay with it.
But you have to let me make the bridesmaid dresses, okay? I think those bridesmaid dresses are a bit premature.
Why? Dan saw you looking at that ring yesterday.
It's not a good time.
There are some, uh, Complicated things happening right now.
Well, whatever they are, you can fix them.
You just have to want it bad enough.
Dad, my whole life, you said that I could do anything If I was willing to risk falling flat on my face.
So why doesn't that same advice apply to you? - Right? - Good point.
And you know I'm right.
I gotta go.
So I'm really glad you chose me over money.
I never really had a choice.
I'm just glad everything's in the open.
I'll go back to North Carolina and work with my father.
Maybe he'll let me design a public service campaign.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I know how hard you've been working.
Well, you shouldn't be.
I 100% brought this on myself.
I could have really made a difference with this company.
And I have to admit, I wanted to rub that money in my father's face.
It was that good of a deal, huh? Poppy's investors would have tripled their money by the end of summer.
Well, then you have to still do it.
Come on, without you, How else will all of the African teenagers Send in posts to "Gossip Girl"? Poppy was serious about calling off her investors.
Well, then find new ones.
Look around.
These are residents of one of the wealthiest co-ops in Manhattan, and smartest.
Our board rejected Bernie Madoff five years in a row.
I thought we found out today Was a mistake mixing business and pleasure.
Please.
I would be so proud to help you.
Really? You sure? - Yes, of course.
Let me go find my mom.
Okay.
Gabriel.
The martinis are great, right? So I heard you, uh, first met Serena On one of her infamous nights with Georgina.
You know, I've always wanted to know what happened.
It must be quite a story.
Oh, Nate, what are you doing here? I thought there was a Mets game.
I saw Dorota wearing her hat.
Yeah, I can just catch the highlights on "Sportscenter.
" I wanted to surprise you.
Are Chuck and Serena here? - Somewhere.
I can't believe I let him talk me into operation 'gone with the weasel'.
It's a long story and unimportant.
What matters is how glad I am you surprised me.
Good.
I'm not done.
I know you're nervous about us being far apart next year, So I got something.
It's a one-bedroom in Murray Hill.
Oh, my god.
Will you move in with me? - Yes.
Yeah? Yes, of course I will.
You're moving in? Yes, she is.
I'm taking her there now, actually.
Well, before you birds fly off to your love nest, There's something you should know.
Gabriel says he met Serena the night before the SATs.
He said they were at Butter.
No, that's impossible.
I know.
We should go tell Serena.
No, no, no.
Chuck can handle this by himself.
Why don't we go see our apartment? Sometimes a queen has to make a choice.
A castle with a white knight, or a quest with a dark prince.
So, B.
, what'll it be? Netflix night with Nate or battling a beast with Bass? The governments, the ISPs, and the big companies need to use these satellites.
We could be the only game in town.
And it has a charitable component too.
Free wireless access for all local schools and community groups.
Well, this is just the sort of thing that some of us at Bass have been pushing for.
Doing well by doing good.
Yes.
But the only thing is there's a ticking clock.
Some of the major internet corporations are pushing to do a similar thing.
If we act now, we block them completely.
And we make at least triple our investment.
Ok, Gabriel, why don't you send a prospectus to my assistant? Of course I have to look at it, But, um, you can tell your backers I'm in.
You were great! Now all you have to do is Tell the rest of the co-op members that she invested, And with my mom's approval, you are golden.
Serena, I need to see you in your room.
Another tour? He's lying to you.
Seriously, you two, enough.
He told Chuck that he met you at Butter, But I know for a fact that Butter was closed that night because I used their bartender for the Nelly Yuki SAT sabotage party! Not that I need to explain this to either of you, But I was with Georgina that night, and she knows the manager.
So it was probably a private party.
Or he just misremembered.
Well, Chuck also saw him making a secretive phone call.
Oh, wow.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, The smoking gun, a secretive phone call.
Blair, I support you in all of your crazy choices, case in point.
Why can't you show me the same respect? Gabriel is a good guy.
He's trustworthy.
Even my mom trusts him, Or she wouldn't have invested in his project just now.
Just face it, you two.
You're using this as an excuse to get together again.
I'm going back to my boyfriend now.
If you know what's good for you, you'll go back to yours.
Butter? Really? It does sound kinda stupid when you say it out loud.
There's only one person who knows what really happened that night Gabriel supposedly met Serena.
Wow.
I'm not going to Yale.
I'm so sorry I let it out like that.
But maybe this way it'll be a little easier on Rufus.
Having to tell you would have killed him.
Yeah, I know.
You don't blame him, do you? I blame the financial aid office And the recession.
And A certain imbecile former president.
My dad has gotta be the only person in the world who's more upset about this news than me.
He was so excited about Selling the gallery and moving on.
Do you think he'll still propose? He's got a lot of pride.
I'll write you a check right now.
I look forward to working with you, Gabriel.
Absolutely.
Gabriel, can I speak to you for a moment? Yeah, of course.
Excuse me.
I'd like to invest as well.
And as much as I appreciate your support, There are other investments better suited for someone in your situation-- Municipal bonds, mutual funds.
I'd be happy to show you how to set something-- I know how to open a mutual fund.
I don't appreciate being patronized.
Oh, no, no, that wasn't my intention.
I apologize.
My money is just as good as anyone else's.
It's how the game works, isn't it? Opportunity arises in the private rooms of restaurants and on exclusive golf courses, and the rich get richer, and the guys in the middle are never there.
Well, I'm right here.
I want in.
I need to see the apartment tomorrow.
There's something I have to do now.
With Chuck? Serena didn't believe us.
You mean she didn't just dump her boyfriend 'cause you two told her to? What's wrong with her No, I'm not going.
Neither should you.
I mean, it's just Chuck playing games.
I don't think it is, And if you don't want to come with us, Then please, just let me go.
I need you to trust me.
The limo's waiting.
You're right.
I need to trust you, and I do, so Go.
You should call Eleanor.
We won't be back tonight.
Wait.
What? I thought she was back home in Connecticut.
You thought wrong.
Yes.
Hello.
What time are your visiting hours? We're coming to see Georgina Sparks.
Get out your brooms, kids.
We're off to see the Wicked Witch of the Upper East Side.
Mr.
Bass? Visiting hours have started.
I can't believe I have to see my sworn enemy With Nancy Pelosi hair.
Now that you mention it, Maybe it's best if I go in alone.
What? You just said it.
You're enemies.
Why would she help you? - Because I'm gonna threaten to send her back to boot camp if she doesn't.
Blair, Georgina and I go way back.
We have a special bond.
I'll handle this one.
You didn't even need me here.
You just wanted to get me alone, away from Nate, away from our first night in our apartment.
And his motives were pure, of course.
I'm sure it's a simple coincidence that he asked you to move in right when you and I began speaking again.
He asked me so I wouldn't have to take the subway next year.
That's maybe why he got the lease on the place.
But asking you to move in was for my benefit.
Ask him yourself.
Or you could just trust him.
Still, the fact remains.
You chose to spend a night in a car with me Over a night in your honeymoon suite with Nate.
But then again, we all knew your weakness for limos.
I came here for my best friend.
Is that the only reason? What is this place? Welcome.
Are you a wayward soul in serching of direction? - I think I'm in the wrong place.
Chuck Bass? Have you been saved, too? Blair was so wrong about you.
What do you mean? I didn't want to make you feel bad, But she and Chuck have this weird vendetta against you.
Some nonsense about Butter being closed that night.
That's ridiculous.
If she would have heard "Savannah's" terrible southern accent that night She'd have a vendetta against you instead of me.
So what'd you think of Georgina anyway? She didn't make that much of impression.
Not even her hair? That flaming red? I mean I swear her colorist is masochistic.
I mean, of course I remember that.
But who cares? If you'd met you that night, You'd forget everything else, too.
I should, uh, I should go home before my mom wakes up.
It's a 7-day session all about forgiveness, And at the end of it, we put on a passion play.
You're more than welcome to come with me.
I have to supervise the kids making paper mashall puzzles for the set.
It's, brilliant.
Oh, it's not that hard.
It's just sd flour and paste.
Getting these Jesus freaks to believe you're one of them So you don't have to go back to boot camp? Still the same old Chuck.
Why can't you believe that people can change? Oh, people can change, but you? You're wrong, Chuck.
You know, as bad as boot camp was, it really gave me time to think about the person I'd become.
Scheming, manipulative.
It sickened me.
So one day I decided to do something about it.
I went to church, found Jesus And I told him all my sins.
Well, I bet that was a long talk.
He forgave me.
Look, I know it seems crazy, but For the first time in my life, I'm--I'm happy.
But if I know Chuck Bass, you're not here to be reformed.
I came to ask if you know a man named Gabriel Edwards.
I don't think so.
Why? He claims he met you at Butter that night you roofied Serena.
Ooh.
yeah, I've been praying overtime for that one.
But that's impossible.
We never went to Butter.
We were back in my hotel by midnight, watching "The Hills" as Serena drooled on my shoulder.
Did you forget something? - Yes! To thank you for your amazing performance last night.
I think we're a good team.
You and Blair were right about Gabriel.
He's lying about meeting me that night.
I don't know why.
Yeah, I know.
Look, hang tight.
Blair and I will be there as soon as we can.
Okay.
Actually Since my limo's gone, that might be a while.
And eventually a queen realizes that a dark prince only has one thing on his mind, And it ain't slaying dragons.
So she takes her pumpkin carriage and goes back to the castle.
With all these investments from the party, We should have everything we need by the end of the month.
You know I thought we were screwed when Chuck Bass called me, But you found a way to make it work, And when you chose being poor and being with Serena She left me a message.
She's awfully needy, isn't she Hey, Gabriel.
It's me.
Listen I'm coming back to your hotel.
We have to talk.
Don't go anywhere.
I'll see you soon.
She sounds nervous.
Yeah, she does.
Well, why would she be? Did something happen? No, it's more like something that didn't happen.
You doing your research properly.
She told me this morning that Butter was closed the night that I allegedly met her there.
And what the hell is Butter? We gotta get out of here, fast.
Just don't answer it.
Okay, it's--it's fine.
I can handle this.
Rufus.
I just wanted to bring you my check in person.
I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have gone with Chuck.
Oh, it's okay.
I'm just glad you came back.
Well, come in.
Let me show you around.
You know I loathe Murray Hill.
Why did you get this apartment? I got it so we wouldn't be so far apart next year.
And is that also why you asked me to move in with you? Blair.
Knowing you and Chuck were hanging out made me jealous.
You said that you trusted me, But you really don't, do you? Blair I'm so sorry.
I love you.
So take your coat off and stay.
Please.
It's serena.
Ooh! Say hi for me.
I have so much love in my heart for that girl.
Did you find him? - No, I'm too late.
What do you mean, you're too late? I mean the drawers and closets are empty.
He's gone.
what do you mean, gone? I have to call you back.
He can't be gone.
I need to talk to him.
I gave him half a million dollars.
Hey, Dan.
Oh.
oh, coffee.
Thank you, dad.
If you're here to deliver the bad news, it's okay.
I already know about Yale.
Actually, that's, uh-- I don't know I was--was so set on going there anyway.
I mean, it's basically a big version of St.
Jude's.
We all know how well I fit in there.
Well, Dan-- I got accepted into a lot of other great schools, A couple-- a couple of great schools.
NYU.
They offer financial aid.
I can always live at home.
Or at our new home.
New home? - Yeah, we got you a little somethin'.
We pooled our savings.
Fortunately, your tastes are very modest.
This is an amazing gesture.
Well, we want you to be happy, dad.
And whatever you and Lily mean for us, I mean, you know, we'll--we'll figure You kids are an inspiration.
But I insist on writing you a check, 'cause there are certain things a man has to do on his own.
Oh, thank god.
Thank god.
Yeah, We were hoping that you will say that.
The reason I came here was not to deliver bad news but good, And if things work out the way I hope they will, Yale will be happening.
Load a lot of other good stuff for this family.
What happened to your limo? Arthur won't answer his phone, but I'm guessing Blair took it.
Blair? You came here with Blair? You know what? It's actually my day off, and I really miss the city.
Oh, dear queen, heed the words of a king.
Look like an angel, talk like an angel, But the devil in disguise.
"Gossip Girl here, your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Will you move in with me? - Yes, of course I will.
I don't want you near her again.
You said you trusted me.
It was a mistake mixing business and pleasure.
I would be so proud to help you.
If we act now, we make at least triple on our investment.
You can tell your backers I'm in.
My money is as good as anyone else's.
I want in.
With these investments From The party.
we should have everything by the end of the month.
The drawers and closets are empty.
He's gone! What do you mean, "Gone"? There's one person who knows what happened that night Gabriel supposedly met Serena.
Chuck Bass? Have you been saved too? - OMJC! - Where has she been? And who am I? That's one secret I'll never tell.
YouTube.
Com/SubsCenter YouTube.
Com/SubsCenter You Know You Love Me XOXP You know you love me.
XOXO Four wise men once said: "I get by with a little help from my friends.
" Do you have a glass? - No, man, what do you think this is? On the Upper East Side, there's the added challenge of figuring out who those friends really are.
Hello? - It's as bad as we thought.
Maybe worse.
How so? Gabriel didn't just skip town.
He took off with the money he got my mom and the co-op to invest.
And he took Poppy's money too.
The entire thing was a scam.
Well, his suits never did fit right.
How much did he get? I'm not sure.
I'm on my way home to tell my mom right now.
When are you gonna be back? As fast as I can, given my current transportation situation.
Hey, Chuck, I really am sorry for not believing you and Blair earlier.
You never did tell me how you found out he was lying about meeting me.
I'll explain when I get there.
No, thank you.
The Lord cannot enter a body sullied by alcohol.
Good, because I like to be the one doing the entering.
To each their own holy water.
We want the harp and not the cello.
And make sure we have two cases of champagne.
Okay.
Goodbye.
I didn't even know you were out.
Yeah, I had to go and try to catch-- - Gabriel? We had a nice time with you last night.
He is so charming.
And that idea.
Yeah, actually, um, I wanted to talk to you about that.
Okay, well, before you do, there is something I want you to have.
I was gonna wait until you were 21 but I've been so proud of you lately, with Brown, and graduation coming.
Go ahead, open it.
It was your great-grandmother's.
I took it out of the safety-deposit box this morning.
It's beautiful, Mom, but it's too much.
I can't accept it.
I don't deserve it.
Well, of course you do.
Serena, you're becoming a wonderful woman and I want you to have something that represents that.
Now, tell me, what were you gonna say about Gabriel? Ugh.
Must be the caterer.
Yeah.
Just take that, and we'll talk later, okay? And thank you.
This is really something.
Don't forget, we have to leave for brunch in 10 minutes.
Hello? Yes.
Hey, Blair, it's me.
Okay.
I need your help again.
I'm on my way.
We'll have to continue later.
Serena needs me.
No.
"Serena needs me" is officially no longer an excuse to avoid talking.
She's my best friend.
Whether you got this apartment because you love me or because you don't trust me will wait.
That wasn't even the question.
The question was, and remains: Do you wanna live in it with me? Serena's waiting.
Fine, I'm coming with you.
Have a great day.
Okay, Dad, seriously, this whole happy thing.
It's a little annoying.
Yeah, seconded.
Humming is fine for home, but "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah" on the F? I'm pretty sure what that lady said meant "stop" in her language.
What's not to be happy about? We're together.
Serena's boyfriend let me in on an investment that could pay for your educations.
And I'm about to propose to Lily.
Wait, what? At brunch? Dad, that's amazing.
No, not quite yet.
I still have to ask permission.
From who, CeCe? No, Lily's not speaking to her, and I'm fine with that.
The person whose permission I seek is Eric.
Well, he's gonna say yes.
Still, Serena's gonna be at Brown next year.
Eric's gonna be there.
He'll been the man of the house.
So after we eat, we'll go for a walk.
I'll show him the ring.
We're not gonna have to wait until next fall for Serena to ditch.
She's skipping brunch.
I'd really hoped we'd all be together.
Let me see what I can do.
She's not a morning person but show up with a bone-dry cappuccino, she'll follow you anywhere.
So I'll meet you at the restaurant.
Hey, and by the way, Dad, congratulations.
Dad.
Come here.
I'm so glad you came, B.
Thank you so much for-- - For bringing Nate? - I'm just as flummoxed as you are.
I got out at 53rd and made a run for it, but he's faster than he looks.
What happened? Don't tell me that hick gave you scabies.
He's gone, with the money.
If you tell me, "I told you so," right now, I might lose it, so please don't.
I'm sorry.
This isn't something I wanted to be right about.
Are you okay? - I don't know.
I don't know.
I keep trying to figure out what was real and what wasn't.
It doesn't make any sense.
Feelings never do.
They get you all confused.
Then they drive you around for hours until they drop you right back to where you started.
I need to fix this.
How can we help? Well, I have a plan.
Tell me if you guys think it's crazy.
Where's Blair? - I agreed to give you a ride.
That's all.
Meals are not included.
I told you, I just want to apologize.
One of the most sacred acts is the ritual of forgiveness.
Why is it when you say "ritual" I think human sacrifice? If I wanted to hurt Blair, don't you think I would've done it by now? Wait here.
Hey, Gabriel, it's me.
Sorry I never came back this morning.
But I was coming to tell you something, and then I I got scared because-- I hope you had an enjoyable ride back on my leather seats.
Shh.
Um Because Well, I might as well just say it now, because I might get too scared again.
I think I might be pregnant.
Okay.
That's it.
Call me, please.
The pregnancy ruse.
Clich, but effective.
Make sure you arrange the meeting someplace where the authorities can surround him.
No open spaces.
You did call the police, right? No, because then my mom will find out, and that can't happen.
Well, all this assumes that the dirtbag even calls you back.
It's obviously time an expert took over this operation.
We're taking care of it.
You didn't mind my taking care of it when it drove off with me.
Left you in the middle of nowhere.
Serena, you should let Chuck handle this.
Gabriel's not calling back.
Just because he took off with the money doesn't mean the feelings between us weren't real.
Not only do I think he's gonna call back but I think I can get the money back from him.
What money? I'm sorry, I just came to coerce you into family brunch.
You didn't happen to see something in the living room, did you? No.
No, why? What's going on? Not that it's your business, but Serena's fake boyfriend's investment was fake.
He Madoffed with the money.
You can go now.
Wait, my dad invested my college money with that guy.
Oh, my God, Dan.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.
I have to tell him.
No, please don't.
I'm taking care of it.
I'm getting everything back.
Unfortunately, the only way her plan is gonna work is by some act of God.
Wow.
Look at that.
I'm so glad that everybody's here.
We need to get this crazy girl out of here.
Are you trying to have me killed? - She's fine.
She found Jesus.
I am going to scream-- Is this how you found out about that night? - You bring Georgina here? - Hey, does anybody know a Gabriel? Gabriel, hey.
Thank you for calling me back.
Hi.
Hi.
You okay? - Not really.
Probably the wrong thing to say.
I'm happy to see you.
You sounded scared when you called me this morning.
And then you didn't show up.
I thought maybe you were having second thoughts about me.
No, not at all.
Just really confused.
Yeah, me too.
I thought we were being careful.
Well, I wasn't careful enough, it seems.
I'm not pregnant.
Just naive.
I can't believe I believed you.
Don't worry.
You're safe, for now.
I wanted to give you the opportunity to fix things to prove you're not who you probably are.
Listen, you have to know how sorry I am.
I don't know what you are right now, except a liar and a thief.
But you can change one of those by giving the money back.
I can't do that.
Gabriel, why, if you're just using me, why come back? Why act like you care about me now? You're not leaving my hotel until you repay your investors.
It's your choice.
Either you hand over the money or we hand you over to the feds.
You have to believe me.
I would if I could.
But I don't have the money.
Poppy Lifton does.
Daniel.
You just missed everyone.
Jenny said something about an exhibit at the Fashion Institute.
And your father pulled Eric away, all very mysterious.
You all right? No, no.
I mean, yeah.
No, I'm not.
I'm sorry.
Well, there's clearly something on your mind.
Well, Serena asked me not to say anything.
Oh, that's my least favorite sentence.
Start talking.
I think she's wrong not to say anything.
She doesn't know how serious this is.
Or if she does, I mean, she thinks she can handle it, and she really can't.
I'm sure if it's important, she'll forgive you for breaking trust.
Yeah.
Gabriel is a con artist.
His investment was a scam.
He took the money for himself, including my dad's.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
Serena thinks she can sweet-talk him into giving everything back.
But, really, I don't think Blair and Chuck can scheme their way out of this one.
I thought about calling the cops, but there's no proof.
You did the right thing telling me.
The last thing we need is the authorities to implicate Serena.
I don't want that.
But how do I tell my dad he got conned out of college money? - You don't.
And you don't need to worry.
I'll take care of it.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Do me a favor and don't say anything to anyone.
We don't need to make this any more complicated than it already is.
Yeah, I just want you to do what you people do and get my dad's money back.
Thank you.
Poppy's rich friends invite her to parties.
Designers give her clothes to wear.
And exes who've given her some awfully nice presents.
In other words, she's a faux-cialite.
I met her at a Mercedes launch party.
The faux-cialite ball.
I tried enticing her into investing in satellites for third-world countries.
She tried enticing me into making her the next Mrs.
Edwards.
Turns out I was awfully good at getting folks to give me their money.
I just wasn't so good at investing it.
Hence, no Wi-Fi for the poor African children.
You know, I had to give my investors something.
I brought on new investors to pay off the old investors.
And then those investors-- - We know, it's called a Ponzi scheme.
Serena, I swear to you, in the beginning you were just a mark.
And your mom, Bart Bass' widow, was gonna be our big score.
But then my feelings for you got in the way of that.
So how did Poppy end up with all the money? It was always business for us.
Soon as we realized we were both playing rich I shared my plans with her, she shared her society connections.
When we hit our number, I was gonna disappear and she was gonna stay behind and just be another rich society gal that I took advantage of.
When you called me this morning she thought you made me.
Smart girl.
Yeah.
She said we had to end it now.
She offered to buy me out so I could leave.
She emptied the account and never showed.
Instead, she went to your hotel room and blamed the entire thing on you.
And I should've just left town.
But I couldn't go without seeing you again.
I'm afraid the only chance you have of getting your money back is finding Poppy Lifton.
This is taking too long.
I'm going to get a cup of coffee.
Wait, no, don't leave me alone with her.
Then come and talk with me.
Oh, or stay with me and talk.
Look, Blair, everyone else has forgiven me.
I'm just waiting on you.
Everyone who? And besides, some things are unforgivable.
God will help me find a way to earn your forgiveness.
Oh, looks like he answers my prayers faster than yours.
Chuck, what happened? - We've got the wrong guy.
Believe it or not, the puppeteer is Poppy.
Poppy? Thank you for actually coming.
Nobody believed you really would.
As much as you don't believe me you're the only girl who was ever worth waking a priest up for.
I really did fall for you.
Well, not enough, it seems.
The money was more important.
Listen, Serena-- - Gabriel, you should go.
Where's he going? My PI hasn't confirmed his story.
Even if it's true, he's still a crook.
He's not the one we need.
If we need to find him, I don't think it'll be that hard.
But why would Poppy stay in town after what she did? She has to if she's gonna play the victim.
She wants us to think Gabriel fooled her.
She wants money.
All we need to provide is some sap she thinks she can get it from.
Except she knows all of us.
She doesn't know all of us.
What? No.
Uh-uh.
Lying is also a sin.
I will not perjure myself in front of the Lord.
We'll see about that.
Looks like Georgina's losing her religion.
Or has B met her match in the battle for G's soul? Here are the names and amounts of the residents who invested with Mr.
Edwards, if that's his real name.
I'm sorry, Bruce.
I know this goes beyond your usual duties.
The Bass business usually does.
Hey, you keep calling.
Is everything okay? Will you excuse us just a moment? I know all about Gabriel's scheme.
And, frankly, I'm disappointed that you did not come to me.
Dan? I'm sorry, Mom.
I was gonna tell you, and then I can't believe he told you.
He obviously sees the situation and my role in it much more clearly than you do.
Well, it is a mess, but it's my mess, and I'm gonna fix it.
You will do no such thing.
This goes far beyond bad taste in boyfriends.
You encouraged me to be with him.
If word gets out about this all anyone will think when they hear the name Serena van der Woodsen is how you helped scam your friends and family out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
I know.
I feel terrible.
That's why I'm gonna get everything back.
I have a plan.
Well, don't be naive.
The Madoff people will be in court for years and never see a dime.
The only plan is for me to tell everyone the deal didn't work out and pay them myself.
What about Poppy? - What about her? - She was behind all of this.
She can't just get away with it.
Yes, she can.
And especially if it means that your name stays out of it.
This is an adult scandal.
The adult thing to do is for me to pay everyone back and for you to do absolutely nothing.
Now let it go.
Am I understood? Yeah.
Okay, Bruce.
Where were we? - We've been over all the investors except Rufus.
Well, how about we handle his payout a little differently? - Uh-oh.
You don't really seem excited.
No, the ring is amazing.
I think it's great you wanna marry my mom.
I just wanna make sure you're prepared.
Well, I have done this before.
So has she.
Four times.
Those guys weren't right for her.
That's true.
But my mom can be a little crazy too.
And I love her.
I just don't want you to forget where she came from.
Trust me.
I know the family and your mother is nothing like her mother.
I'm up for the wild ride that is Lily Rhodes- van der Woodsen-Bass, et cetera.
Well, welcome to the family then.
You thought about how you're gonna propose? Klaus with a K did it with a blimp.
C- Claus did it on a pyramid.
Although she didn't say yes to that.
But you have the bar set pretty high.
Sure, but, uh Yeah, yeah, I have lots of ideas.
Come on, G.
Don't you miss Dior? Prada? Looking fabulous? I mean, for you.
Jesus loves me as I am.
He would love you more with some styling.
Think of the fun you used to have pretending to be Sarah and Svetlana slipping people roofies outing them to their unsuspecting parents at dinner.
Those things don't call to me anymore, Blair.
Look, I made a choice.
I let go of the evil so I can find love and happiness with the good.
I know it sounds dull, but it's actually quite nurturing.
Can't you understand? More than you know.
I gave up my old ways when I let Jesus take the wheel.
That is a Carrie Underwood song, not a life choice.
I'm sorry, but I can't help you if it goes against my beliefs.
But when you look at it, Jesus drove you here, right? I believe his name was Jess.
Not in the cab, in your country-western way of life.
You said God would help you find a way to earn my forgiveness.
And here it is.
So my amends would be to entrap Poppy Lifton get the money back that she stole, and destroy her in the process? Exactly.
If you cut revenge out of the Bible there's not even enough pages to make a pamphlet.
And they shall know I am the Lord, when I shall lay my vengeance on them.
How'd you know my favorite passage? - Hey, S.
My mom wants us to call off the plan.
What? No.
Do you know how much work this exorcism was? It's gonna take days for Dorota to reorganize my closet.
I don't like it either.
I'm just telling you.
She wants to take care of things and leave Poppy out of it.
Poppy is it.
She's so evil she makes the old Georgina look like the new Georgina.
Serena? - I have to go.
Just put the plan on hold, and do not do anything until I call you back, okay? - S, wait.
I mean it, Blair.
Yes, well, the cookies came from Poppy came by to see how we were doing after all of the terrible drama this morning.
I mean, the money part was bad, but I just felt like such an idiot.
I thought he loved me.
Obviously, you understand that.
Obviously.
Poppy also told me that she's going to Miami tomorrow night.
Yeah, I have a cousin down there and I just thought if I have to feel like a fool I might as well do it with a tan.
You might wanna check.
You have-- - Oh, excuse me.
Yes.
What are you doing having tea and smiling at her? - Lock the doors and call the police.
We discussed it.
The adult thing to do is to let it and her disappear.
She's not disappearing.
She's going to Miami.
She's gonna do the same thing to new people.
We can only hope that those people will be smarter than we were.
My dad's not home.
Can I take a message? Just let him know the paperwork from his recent investment's on its way.
There must be a mistake.
I was told that investment didn't happen.
No, sir.
He should begin to receive dividends in about six weeks.
I don't care what my mother says.
Poppy Lifton must pay.
I knew you'd come to your senses.
Ta-da.
Hello.
Sherilyn Phillips.
My daddy's got a piece of the oil sands up in Alberta a piece the size of Florida.
I'm so excited to meet my first New York friend for tea tomorrow.
Maybe you know her.
Poppy Lifton? Nice to meet you, Sherilyn.
What do you think? I sense aspiration, yearning, striving to be accepted.
But then there's this appealing counter-note of sincerity and optimism.
This is the story of a young girl who's enjoying her first taste of the spoils of dirty oil.
It's perfection.
Well, there's no detail too small to make sure Poppy Lifton goes down hard.
You think this is better than calling the cops? It's better than my mother sleeping with the enemy.
This will work.
Georgina has a recording device in her handbag.
Once we get Poppy on tape talking money we can blackmail her into handing over the cash.
If Poppy got arrested, she'll never give up money.
And as annoyed as I am with Dan right now, it is his college tuition.
How do we know she's gonna show up? She thinks Gabriel took the fall.
All she's worried about now is party invitations and keeping a seat at Bryant Park.
And she's greedy.
Hello? - You said the Gabriel deal was a scam.
So why's my dad getting a call about dividends? I don't know.
Call my mom.
You seem to like to talk to her these days.
What was I supposed to do? It's not fair of you to ask me to trust the return of my tuition to Blair and Chuck.
I told you I would take care of it, and that's what I'm doing now.
Don't expect me to drink alcohol in this scheme.
It's the Russian Tea Room.
You can drink tea.
Serena, what are you doing? I'm in the elevator.
I'm losing you.
Sorry.
Eric said Lily's at Barneys.
We have a couple hours.
I hope she likes all of this.
Aw! - Dad, you're nervous.
That's so cute.
Hey, do not call your father cute.
Dad, Lily's gonna love the proposal.
I hope so.
It's not exactly fireworks over the Eiffel Tower or a G5.
No, but you got her favorite flowers, tracked down her favorite wine bought bespoke chocolates, and you made all her favorite foods.
Although I still think spare ribs and scallops are kind of gross together.
If you're trying to make me feel better, you're failing.
All I'm saying is that big proposals are great, sure but yours has something more important.
It shows that you really know her and you love her for who she is.
You're right, I do.
Quick, buy me five minutes.
Yeah, I'm on it.
Hi.
Oh, I wasn't expecting to see you.
Lily.
Yeah, I know, I wanted you to-- Here, I'll take those.
Show me that Marchesa dress that you wore last week.
I loved the zippers.
Hey, we need to talk.
Can't we talk inside? - We need to talk about Blair.
Trouble in paradise? A couple days ago, you told me you were done with her.
Then you did everything you could to get close to her again.
If you have a problem with my proximity to your girlfriend ask Serena not to get into so much trouble.
I couldn't figure out why you would go out of your way to lie to me about how you felt.
Then I realized you're not lying to me.
You're lying to yourself.
That's a lovely theory you've concocted, Nathaniel.
You should have it published.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
No, you had your shot, and you blew it.
So why start toying with her again? I mean, if you want her, then man up and tell her.
Otherwise, you gotta cut her loose.
You gotta cut her loose, and for real this time because I want her.
Bella's in love, even though he's a vampire.
Maybe it's because he's a vampire.
His family doesn't suck blood.
It makes her feel safer.
But the more he falls in love with her, the more-- Jenny.
Just one minute, Jenny.
Okay.
Okay.
Hello? - Yes, okay.
I'm gonna Oh, okay.
Thank you.
Bye.
Hi.
I'm sorry, Daniel.
What was your question? I got nowhere with Serena on this.
Maybe you have an answer.
Why is my dad getting calls about dividends? Did you not get his money back? Um, I did.
I put it in a very safe mutual fund that will pay him dividends each month.
Okay.
Then what is Serena still taking care of at the Russian Tea Room right now? - Hello? - Whatever you're doing I need you to stop right now.
She can't just get away with it.
You can smile at Poppy all you want, Mom, but I'm not like that.
It's not right.
I will not tolerate you deciding what is right in this situation.
I am your mother, and I am telling you to stop this instant.
It is nonnegotiable.
Serena, do you hear me? I'm sorry, Mom.
I have to go.
Serena, don't you dare-- Hi, it's Lily Bass.
Well, find him.
I need to speak with him right now.
They say that numbers don't lie and money talks.
Hi, are you Sherilyn? I'm Poppy.
Poppy, it's so nice to meet you.
But can Georgina still speak Poppy's language? I'm just loving it here.
Are you a Carrie? I'm a Charlotte.
A Carrie? Um, yeah.
I thought so.
Yeah.
Did you see Poppy's here? - I did.
Georgina's going to text me as soon as she starts talking money.
Great.
You look like you could use a cocktail.
You're too late.
Wow.
What? That's the first true laugh I've gotten out of you in a while.
Listen, Blair-- - No, me first.
Nate's waiting for me to give him an answer.
I heard.
Don't you wanna know what's stopping me? I can't answer his question while I'm waiting for you to answer mine.
The one I asked you forever ago.
What are we, Chuck? Blair Last fall, you said we couldn't be together and I believed you.
But every time I try to move on, you're right there acting like-- - Acting like what? Like Maybe you just want me to be as unhappy as you are.
I would never wish that on anyone.
I want you to be happy.
Then look down deep into the soul I know you have and tell me if what you feel for me is real or if it's just a game.
If it's real we'll figure it out all of us.
But if it's not then please, Chuck, just let me go.
It's just a game.
I hate to lose.
You're free to go.
Thank you.
Chuck, why did you just do that? Because I love her and I can't make her happy.
New York is full of people doing such amazing things.
Who knew you could bring wireless to third-world countries? What a great job.
Yeah, it's really more of a passion than a job.
I mean, it gives so much to the children.
Of course.
I mean, they can look at faraway places and read Bible stories and-- Oh, well, they can download Kirk Cameron movies.
Yeah.
You know I'd really love to be a part of something like that.
My father was really hoping I'd find something philanthropic to do while I'm down here.
I mean, you're such a great girl.
Look, if you can get me a payment today I'll find a way to get you in.
Really? That would be amazing.
I can't wait to help the children.
Let me just call the bank to set up a wire transfer.
I'm sorry, because of the time crunch I'm afraid I'm only gonna be able to accept cash.
Hey, the police just pulled up.
The police? I thought Chuck was calling his PI.
Where is he? - He left, believe it or not.
But as long as Georgina has Poppy on tape, we can let the cops arrest her.
Okay, well, text Georgina.
Make sure she's ready.
I'm gonna go talk to the police.
Um Well, this is all the money I have for emergencies.
But if you let me text my father, I'm sure he can arrange for something more.
No, no, it's okay.
That's a great start.
Okay.
God intended for us to meet.
I'm just glad I was able to get you in.
So I'll call you later.
Oh, for cosmos.
Yeah, okay.
Hi.
Chuck had to leave, but the woman he called about is inside.
I can take you-- - Serena van der Woodsen? - Yeah, that's right.
You're under arrest.
What? Wait, no, no, there's been a mistake.
It's Poppy-- - What is taking so long? Serena-- - Blair, Blair, tell them.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing? - You have the wrong girl.
What--? - I don't think so.
What's going on? Why are they taking Serena? - Serena, it's okay.
We'll figure it out.
Blair, call Chuck.
Call Chuck.
Serena, it's okay.
Blair, what's going--? - Your plan was a rousing success.
So they arrested her? - If by "her" you mean Serena, yes.
Wait, I don't understand.
Why would they arrest Serena? You should know.
Pretending to find Jesus to take us all down.
It borders on brilliant.
What are you talking about? L-- Where's Poppy? I gave her the camp's Bible money.
Oh, nice touch.
But you texted me, "All set?" Poppy was asking for a down payment.
All I had was money my camp gave me to buy Bibles.
You expect me to believe that after all you've done? Your stupid clothes and your Bible quotes don't fool anyone.
You're evil.
I know it.
You know it.
And God knows it too.
But I didn't do anything wrong.
I will never forgive you for what you've done.
And neither will Jesus.
Rufus, I hope you weren't waiting too long.
What's this? Where did you find that? It's a list of Gabriel's investors.
Oh, what beautiful lilies.
With bags of money matching their investments? What's going on here, Lily? Well, if you must know, the investment didn't work out.
So I'm taking care of getting everyone's money back to them.
How about your different plan for me? Rufus, this really isn't a big deal.
You were planning on giving me money every month behind my back.
Do you have any idea how humiliating that is? Well, I wasn't trying to humiliate you.
I was just trying to help you.
You had to know I'd never go for it.
Well, you should.
Do you know how hard it is to watch you agonize over not being able to send Dan to Yale when I could very easily help if you would let me? You are not putting this on me.
I've raised my kids just fine without your help.
I'm sorry, I have to take this.
I don't understand.
You were supposed to arrest Poppy.
We have her on tape committing fraud.
Fraud? - Yes.
Thank you.
I don't understand what you thought you were arresting me for.
Theft.
What? No.
No, I didn't steal that.
That was my great-grandmother's.
You can call my mother, Lily Bass.
She'll tell you this is a mistake.
Lily Bass? - Yes.
She called it in.
Thank you, detective.
I'll be down in a bit.
What was that? - Serena's in a little trouble again.
Is she okay? - She's been arrested.
Oh, no.
Come on, I'll go with you.
No, I'm not going just yet.
I'm sorry, I don't think I understand-- - I had her arrested.
Look, I know how that sounds, but I had no choice.
This from the woman who wouldn't let me put Jenny in a squad car? I am not a monster, Rufus.
I'm not gonna let her sit and rot behind bars.
But I needed to remove her from the situation so she'd have time to think.
So you called the police on her? - Yes, so I could drop the charges and in a few weeks, everyone would forget it ever happened.
Are you hearing yourself? I asked her to stop, and she purposely disobeyed me.
Look, this was the only way that I could protect her.
From what, Lil? - From creating a scandal.
From ruining her future and everything that she's worked for embarrassing me.
You just sounded exactly like your mother.
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.
What is all of this? That, um That was a big mistake.
Where is she? - Inside, but they won't let us talk to her.
We'll see about that.
You called him? - Of course I did.
He's her brother.
You have nothing to worry about with Chuck anymore.
Did he tell you that? - He gave me my answer.
And you deserve yours.
I don't think we should move in together.
Me neither.
Then why--? - Look, I just I'm sorry.
I was using the apartment to force our issues, and it's just-- It's too big of a step.
I'm sorry.
Well, perhaps a more suitable step would be for you to ask me to prom.
Hello? - Hello, Blair.
Georgina? You don't sound like yourself.
That's funny, because I feel more like myself than ever.
Where are you? Taking care of what you obviously couldn't.
I don't think Jesus would approve of that.
Well, you can tell Jesus that the bitch is back.
Follow that car.
Oh, no.
We warned you no good would come from spinning a wicked web.
You just get all tangled up in your own lies.
Hey, how'd it go? Did she love it? Please return this for me.
And the more you twist, the tighter the trap.
I need you to dig up what dirt you can on the officers of the 55th Precinct.
Detective Sanders? My grandfather said you'd be able to help me get some information.
Serena's mom gave her that bracelet.
It's been in the family for years.
She couldn't have stolen it.
Until you're locked in a prison of your own making.
Smile for the camera, Sernea.
(XOXO, Gossip Girl.
)
AND WHO AM I? THAT'S A SECRET I'LL NEVER TELL.
YOU KNOW YOU LOVE ME.
X.O.X.O.
, GOSSIP GIRL.
YOU ASK YOURSELF WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE LIFE IS SO STRANGE DESTINATION UNKNOWN WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR DESTINATION AND SOMETHING COULD CHANGE RHODES RECORDS.
RICK RHODES' OFFICE.
HI.
IS HE IN? IT'S LILY.
WHO? HIS DAUGHTER? OH.
AHEM.
ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
HEY, LIL.
LONG TIME, BABE.
HI, DAD.
I KNOW, UM, WHICH IS WHY I WAS HOPING THAT WE COULD, LIKE, CATCH UP OR SOMETHING.
THERE'S SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT.
IS THERE ANY WAY THA YOU CAN, UH, HAVE LUNCH? YOU'RE IN L.
A.
? WHY AREN'T YOU IN SANTA BARBARA? IN SCHOOL? WELL, WE CAN MAKE I A DINNER IF THAT'S BETTER FOR YOU.
I'M LEAVING FOR LONDON.
BUT, LIL, WHAT'S GOING ON? GEOFFREY'S? YOUR REGULAR TABLE? GREAT.
OKAY, SEE YOU THEN.
LOVE YOU.
MRS.
BASS? WE'RE HERE.
OH, YES.
THANK YOU.
SERENA'S BEEN IN JAIL FOR OVER FOUR HOURS.
SHE'S ALREADY SERVED MORE TIME THAN NICOLE RICHIE AND LINDSAY LOHAN COMBINED.
SHE'S A SOCIALITE MISTAKENLY ACCUSED OF STEALING A BRACELET.
I DOUBT THEY'RE WORKING HER OVER WITH THE PHONE BOOK.
WHEN I CALLED LILY, SHE SAID SHE WAS ON HER WAY.
WHERE IS SHE? I JUST CAN' BELIEVE SHE HAD HER OWN DAUGHTER ARRESTED.
I MEAN, WHO DOES THAT? SOMEONE WHO'S NEVER BEEN ARRESTED.
HELLO.
I'M LILIAN BASS.
I'M HERE FOR MY DAUGHTER, SERENA VAN DER WOODSEN.
SO WAS LILY BLOWN AWAY? WELL, NOT REALLY.
YEAH, HE NEVER ACTUALLY, UH PROPOSED.
MINOR DETAIL IN A PROPOSAL.
KINDA THE KEY INGREDIENT TO THE RECIPE.
SO HE CAME HOME AND WENT INTO HIS ROOM.
UH, WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE.
AHEM.
HEY, DAD.
OH, SO PROM TOMORROW NIGH WHAT DO YOU SAY? WE STAY IN, WATCH SOME SCARY MOVIES? THE SCARIER THE BETTER.
ABSOLUTELY.
YOU GUYS ARE THE GOSSIP GIRL GENERATION.
DON'T EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED IN THIS GOSSIP.
UH, NOPE.
ONLY INTERESTED IN MY NIM CHOW.
SO TO ADD TO THE LILY INTRIGUE OR POSSIBLY HELP EXPLAIN I I GOT A WEIRD CALL ABOUT YOUR INVESTMENT.
THE MONEY'S GONE.
IT'S OVER.
REALLY? 'CAUSE, UH, SERENA HAD A PLAN TO GET IT ALL BACK.
IT'S NO, LILY HAD A PLAN OF HER OWN.
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I WAS HOPING.
YEAH, SHE HAD SERENA ARRESTED.
WHAT? WWHY? I SUGGEST YOU KIDS STAY OUT OF IT.
LET THESE VAN DER WOODSEN WOMEN FIGHT IT OUT THEMSELVES.
WOW.
YOU FORCED ME TO DO THIS.
I JUST HOPE YOU LEARNED YOUR LESSON.
THAT MY MOM'S CRAZIER THAN I EVER IMAGINED? WELL, NO CRAZIER THAN YOU, MY DAUGHTER, THINKING YOU COULD FIX THIS SITUATION YOURSELF.
I WAS FIXING THIS, BUT THEN YOU WERE TOO WORRIED WHA PEOPLE WOULD THINK.
WHEN YOU'RE A MOTHER, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT DON'T ALWAYS WIN YOU POINTS FOR POPULARITY.
WHEN I'M A MOTHER, I WILL BE NOTHING LIKE YOU.
YES, YOU SAY THAT NOW, BUT JUST WAIT.
I WOULD RATHER GIVE MY KIDS UP FOR ADOPTION THAN END UP LIKE YOU.
OH, WAIT.
YOU DID THAT.
I CAME DOWN HERE TO DROP THE CHARGES AND PUT THIS BEHIND US.
PLEASE SHOW A LITTLE RESPECT, AND I WILL STICK WITH MY PLAN.
I'LL JUST STICK TO MINE.
IF YOU DIDN'T NOTICE, YOU WEREN'T MY PHONE CALL.
OH, SO WHO WAS? SHE CALLED ME, DARLING.
IRONIC, ISN'T IT? IF ONLY SHE KNEW.
HEY, GRANDMA.
FOR THOSE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE YOUTH OF TODAY, IF YOU THINK WE'RE BAD, YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN OUR PARENTS.
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH AHMET WANTS TO GIVE HIM.
THE GUY CAN'T SING.
I'LL PAY FOR HIS PUBLISHING.
GOODBYE.
HEY, BEAUTIFUL.
YOU GET LOST? I'M SORRY I'M LATE.
I COULDN'T FIND PARKING.
THAT'S WHAT THE VALET'S FOR.
RIGHT, BU IT ALSO COSTS $2, AND I JUST SPENT THAT ON GAS.
HERE TO HIT DAD UP FOR SOME CASH? WHAT? NO.
SO, UM, CHRISTMAS WAS WEIRD WITHOUT YOU.
YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTAN THE FOURTH QUARTER IS TO RETAIL.
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA KEEP TOWER RECORDS IN BUSINESS.
BUT I WAS SORRY I COULDN'T BE THERE.
YEAH UM, ABOUT THAT I'M NOT A HEADSHRINKER OR ANYTHING, BUT I DO THINK THE SUDDEN UPROOTING OF MY FAMILY FROM NEW YORK, COUPLED WITH MY PARENTS' TUMULTUOUS DIVORCE MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO SOME RECENT DIFFICULTIES THAT I MIGHT BE HAVING.
YOU GOT KICKED OUT OF BOARDING SCHOOL.
WHAT? WAIT, WAIT.
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT? SHE TOLD ME.
MOM.
HELLO, LILY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? IF IT WAS UP TO YOUR FATHER, THEY'D STOP ME AT THE COUNTY LINE, BUT SANTA BARBARA'S REALLY ONLY A PRISON IN MY MIND, GOOD TO SEE YOU, CECE.
WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME, RICHARD.
YOU HUNG UP THE PHONE WITH ME, AND YOU CALLED HER? YOU DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN.
THAT'S BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE TO PARENT, AND WE KNOW HE ALWAYS LEAVES BAD COP TO ME.
PUNISHING LOVED ONES JUS COMES SO MUCH MORE NATURALLY TO SOME PEOPLE.
EXCUSE ME.
MAY I HAVE A GIN AND TONIC? NO TONIC.
I COME WITH SOME GOOD NEWS.
YOU'RE LETTING ME LIVE WITH DAD? NO WAY.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY.
MY BAGS ARE IN THE CAR.
AND CAN I HAVE THE ROOM THAT OVERLOOKS THE TENNIS COURTS? I LOVE THAT ROOM.
THANK YOU FOR COMING ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE, MOM, BUT I THINK THIS IS ALL WORKED OUT, RIGHT? RICHARD? LILY, THAT SOUNDS SO GOOD.
IT'S JUS ACTUALLY, YOUR FATHER DID MAKE A CALL TO THE SCHOOL.
I TOLD 'EM WHAT HAD BEEN HAPPENING AT HOME, ABOUT YOUR SISTER TAKING OFF, YOUR MOTHER AND I SPLITTING UP.
I EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS AN ISOLATED, UNCHARACTERISTIC ACT OF REBELLION.
THEY'RE WILLING TO TURN YOUR EXPULSION INTO A SUSPENSION.
WHAT? YOU CAN BE BACK ON MONDAY.
BUT I WANTED TO GET EXPELLED.
LILY, WHATEVER FOR? THAT SCHOOL HAS EVERYTHING.
EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR DAD.
YOU'RE LIVING THIS AMAZING NEW LIFE HERE, AND I'M JUST SCARED THAT BY THE TIME I GRADUATE, I WON'T BE A PART OF IT ANYMORE.
AND WHAT IF YOU FORGET ABOUT ME? LIL, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO EVER WORRY ABOUT THAT.
I JUST HAVE A LO GOING ON RIGHT NOW WITH WORK.
I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE TIME, THE SUPERVISION THAT YOU NEED.
JUST LIKE CLOCKWORK.
OKAY.
DAD.
I'M LATE.
I'VE GOTTA PACK, GET TO THE AIRPORT.
PUT LUNCH ON MY ACCOUNT.
I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.
DAD, NO.
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO DO THAT? DAD.
THANK YOU.
PLEASE DON'T WALK AWAY.
YOU NEED TO BE WITH YOUR MOTHER, LIL, OUT OF THE CITY, IN SCHOOL.
WE CAN'T LET YOU TURN OUT LIKE YOUR SISTER.
CAROL? YEAH, I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT FRONT.
SHE RAN AWAY FROM OUR FAMILY, AND FOR WHAT? TO BECOME AN ACTRESS, WHICH IS A COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC GOAL.
I MEAN, YEAH, SHE WAS PRETTY GOOD AS ABIGAIL IN THE CRUCIBLE, BU WHAT WAS THAT, LIKE, 11TH GRADE? ANYWAY, THE POINT IS I'M NOT CAROL.
I DON'T CRAVE ADVENTURE OR THE FREEDOM TO WALK MY OWN PATH.
I'M PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE WITH THE PATH THAT YOU GUYS HAVE LAID OUT FOR ME.
GO HOME, LIL.
DAD, YOU HAVE A GIAN HOUSE.
I WON'T BE ANY TROUBLE.
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I GET BACK FROM LONDON.
I'M SORRY.
I LOVE YOU.
LILY, IT'S OVER.
LET'S GO HOME.
I'LL FOLLOW YOU BACK.
SEE YOU AT HOME.
ERIC AND I HAD THE MOST INVIGORATING WALK FROM THE HOTEL.
YOU KNOW, GRANDMA IS DECEPTIVELY QUICK.
OH, SHE'S PROBABLY RACING BACK TO THAT BOTTLE OF GIN SHE HAS HIDDEN UNDER THE SINK IN THE BATHROOM.
ZING.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU AS WELL.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, MOTHER? I DON'T REMEMBER INVITING YOU AS OUR GUEST.
I KNOW I HAVEN'T CALLED YOU, AND I'M POSITIVE YOU HAVEN' SO MUCH AS RECEIVED A CHRISTMAS CARD OR FRUITCAKE AT THE HOLIDAY.
WELL, YOU CAN BE THANKFUL FOR THE LAST ONE.
WHAT HAVE I DONE TO EARN YOUR IRE, MY DEAR? WELL, LET ME THINK FOR A SECOND.
MAYBE TELLING RUFUS ABOUT OUR CHILD? I'M SORRY IF I THOUGHT IT APPROPRIATE THAT RUFUS LEARNS HE HAS A SON.
UH, YOU MEAN HAD.
HE DIED.
OH.
I HAD NO IDEA.
IMAGINE, SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW.
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M GOING TO TAKE SERENA BREAKFAST IN BED SO I CAN START THE HEALING WITH MY DAUGHTER.
UH, YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT A HOLD ON THE HEALING.
SERENA'S NOT IN HER ROOM.
WHAT? I THOUGHT SHE WAS COMING HOME WITH YOU.
WHERE IS SHE? WHY ARE YOU STILL IN JAIL? IT'S MY CHOICE.
OH, GOD.
YOU'RE NO GONNA COME OUT OF THERE WITH A MULLET AND A GIRLFRIEND, ARE YOU? MY MOTHER DIDN'T THINK THAT I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS, SO I DECIDED TO STAY IN JAIL, AND I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL SHE AGREES TO LET ME LIVE MY OWN LIFE.
SO IT'S A WAR OF ATTRITION.
SO TO SPEAK.
EXCEPT SHE GETS TO WAGE THE WAR FROM THE COMFOR OF HER PENTHOUSE WHILE YOU REMAIN BEHIND BARS.
LOOK, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
ENJOY PROM WITH NATE, LIKE YOU ALWAYS PLANNED IN THAT SCRAPBOOK THAT YOU KEPT UNDER YOUR BED.
PLEASE.
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.
I WAS A CHILD THEN.
I SHOULD GO.
I DON'T WAN TO ABUSE MY PHONE PRIVILEGES.
THE FACT THA YOU'RE ON AN ACTUAL PAY PHONE HAS ME BEYOND NAUSEOUS.
STAY STRONG, S.
WHAT'S THIS FOR? STRENGTH.
YOU WILL NEED.
I HAVE GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS.
WHICH DO YOU WANT? GOOD NEWS FIRST, ALWAYS.
THERE IS REPLACEMENT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT MAKES MORE SENSE IF YOU PICK BAD NEWS FIRST.
YOUR DRESS FOR PROM.
THE DRY CLEANERS THEY RUINED IT.
THIS BODY BAG.
CORPSE NOT PRETTY.
BUT THERE'S A REPLACEMENT.
BACK TO GOOD NEWS.
THIS MORNING IT ARRIVED FROM PARIS.
JUST LIKE IN SCRAPBOOK.
OH! IT IS.
OH! JUST LIKE MY SCRAPBOOK I DON'T REMEMBER KEEPING AND HAVEN'T LOOKED A SINCE I WAS AN EARLY ADOLESCENT.
OH, IIT MUST BE FROM DADDY.
TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE MAGICAL.
YOU KNOW, PROM HASN' EXACTLY BEEN GOING AS PLANNED.
THE FLORISTS LOST BLAIR'S CORSAGE.
SOMEONE BOUGHT UP ALL THE PEONIES, AND WHEN I CALLED TO CONFIRM MY LIMO, IT HAD BEEN RENTED OUT BY A BACHELORETTE PARTY IN JERSEY.
THE HEART QUICKENS.
YEAH, WELL, MY HOTEL ROOM WAS MYSTERIOUSLY CANCELED, AND NOW I JUST FOUND OU BLAIR'S DRESS HAS BEEN RUINED.
HOW TRAGIC.
I GOTTA ASK AM I SABOTAGING YOUR DREAM PROM? THE ANSWER IS NO, NATHANIEL.
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WE NEED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION.
BLAIR IS YOURS.
OKAY.
OH, WHAT A RESTORATIVE NAP THAT WAS.
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.
WELL, I'M AFRAID THA MOMENT IS NOT GOING TO LAST.
ERIC OUT OF EARSHOT? I SENT HIM TO A MOVIE WITH JONATHAN.
SO NO ONE CAN HEAR ME SCREAM.
YOU'RE GONNA WHAT, LILY, HACK ME TO PIECES, SUFFOCATE ME WITH A PILLOW? I AM SIMPLY AND FOR THE LAS TIME GONNA ASK YOU TO LEAVE MY HOME AND NEVER COME BACK.
NEVER IS A, UH, VERY LONG TIME, DARLING.
YOU ARE TOXIC.
I'M YOUR MOTHER.
AND A MEMORABLE ONE AT THAT, SO MUCH SO IT SEEMS THAT TRY AS I MIGHT, I CAN'T HELP TURNING INTO YOU.
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU FINALLY ARE STARTING TO SEE THE WISDOM OF MY WAYS.
YOU BLAME ME FOR EVERYTHING.
AND YOU ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR NOTHING.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE CAROL'S RIGHT.
THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE A NORMAL LIFE IS WITHOUT YOU IN IT.
YOUR SISTER WAS REBELLIOUS AND UNGRATEFUL FOR MY LOVE, AND LOOK WHERE SHE ENDED UP.
FROM WHERE I'M SITTING, IT DOESN'T LOOK SO BAD.
I DON'T WANT YOU MEDDLING WITH MY FAMILY OR WITH MY LOVE LIFE ANYMORE.
I WANT YOU OUT.
NOW.
HI.
I'M LOOKING FOR MY SISTER CAROL.
CAROL RHODES.
UH, I THINK THA SHE WORKS HERE.
IS SHE IN? I'M COVERING FOUR EXTRA TABLES TODAY, SO THAT'D BE NO.
FLAKING ON WORK THAT SEEMS LIKE CAROL.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE MIGHT BE? HEY! WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING, SPAZ.
YOU ALMOST GOT UDON ALL OVER MY GUCCI.
PERSONALLY, I DON'T SEE IT.
SEE WHAT? THE FAMILY RESEMBLANCE.
TO CAROL? WAIT.
YOU KNOW HER? YEAH.
WELL, DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE MIGHT BE? TRYING TO WORK HERE.
WELL, YOU MISSED A SPOT.
IT'S KINDA STICKY.
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
I'VE HAD A REALLY ROUGH DAY.
I GOT KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL, MY DAD DOESN'T WANT ME TO LIVE WITH HIM, I CAN'T STAND MY MOM, I SPENT THE LAST $9 THAT I HAD ON GAS, AND SO NOW I'M BROKE AND I'M HOMELESS, AND UNLESS I CAN FIND MY SISTER, WHO I BASICALLY HAVEN'T TALKED TO IN, LIKE, A YEAR, I'M GONNA HAVE TO BECOME A PROSTITUTE.
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO BE A PROSTITUTE.
I MEAN, REALLY, HOW MUCH SMALL TALK IS REQUIRED? AND WHERE DO YOU EVEN GO? AND ARE B.
J.
S A MUST? BECAUSE IF THAT'S THE CASE, I AM SO NOT DOING THAT.
NOT THAT ANY OF THA INFORMATION IS RELEVAN UNLESS YOU'RE A JOHN.
NOT A JOHN.
OWEN.

THERE'S A GIG AT THE 607 TONIGHT.
CHANCES ARE YOUR SISTER WILL BE THERE.
MY FRIEND'S KINDA DATING HER.

MY SHIFT ENDS IN TEN.
PROBABLY SEE YOUR SISTER.
DON'T WANT TO COME, I'LL GIVE HER YOUR REGARDS AND SUMMARIZE THE WHOLE, UH, PROSTITUTE THING.
I COULD CHANGE.
I HAVE MY SUITCASE IN THE CAR.
YEAH.
I'M JUST GUESSING, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA WORK.
YOU SHOULD TRY SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
YOUR SISTER'S ALWAYS CHANGING FOR AUDITIONS AND STUFF.
WOW.
SHE'S REALLY CHANGED.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SHE HAS THIS.
WE WENT ICE SKATING AT ROCKEFELLER CENTER.
SHE SNUCK ME OUT OF THE HOUSE.
WE TOOK A BUS ACROSS TOWN.
MY MOM WAS SO FURIOUS.
IT WAS SO MUCH FUN.
WE WERE, LIKE, BEST FRIENDS.
YOU CAN GO NOW.
ALREADY OUT THE DOOR.
OH, HELLO, DANIEL.
HEY.
SO, UH, LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, BUT I CAN'T LEAVE SERENA ONE MORE MESSAGE AND STILL CALL MYSELF A MAN.
NOT THAT IT'S EXACTLY MANLY TO BE CALLING HER MOTHER, BUT IIII REALLY NEED TO KNOW, UH, HOW MAD IS SHE? OH, II WOULDN'T WORRY.
SHE HASN'T GOTTEN YOUR MESSAGES.
THEY TAKE YOUR CELL PHONE AWAY WHEN YOU'RE IN JAIL.

WE'RE LOOKING FOR HER SISTER.
NO TIME TO TALK, GUYS.
YOUR NEEDS ARE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT.
I HAVE A PLAN.
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, IT'S MORE THAN A PLAN.
IT'S A MISSION.
BU IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ME.
IT'S ABOUT MY LADY.
SHE'S BEEN WRONGED, AND I'M GONNA MAKE IT RIGHT.
WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOUR LADY, TATTOO THE WRONG BUTT CHEEK? RANDY WALTER SHEPPARD! MY 20S ARE TICKING AWAY AS WE SPEAK, AND WE GOTTA GO NOW! CAROL! CAROL? LILY? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING WITH MY SISTER? WHOA.

LOOK AT THIS PLACE.
I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO MAKE MY LIFE RESEMBLE THE MOVIE IN MY HEAD, AND TONIGHT, NO EFFORT REQUIRED.
VOIL? VOTE FOR PROM KING AND QUEEN? WE DON'T DO PROM QUEEN.
THAT'S FOR SUBURBAN SCHOOLS AND THE LAME TEEN COMEDIES THAT ARE SET AT THEM.
WE'RE DOING IT THIS YEAR.
THERE'S A TIARA AND EVERYTHING.
A TIARA? BUT IF YOU DON'T WAN TO VOTE FOR YOURSELVES WE WERE NOMINATED.
LET'S SEE.
I MEAN, OF COURSE WE WERE.
AW, YOU GUYS, I THINK I'M GETTING SENTIMENTAL.
IT'S TRUE.
THIS IS PROBABLY OUR LAST HUDDLE.
YEAH, IF YOU DO THIS STUFF IN COLLEGE, PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE PATHOLOGICAL.
COME ON, LADIES.
LET'S COMMIT ELECTION FRAUD.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE BLAIR'S FACE WHEN SHE LOSES PROM QUEEN TO NELLY.
AND LOOK, II KNOW THIS THING WITH YOUR MOM TOOK ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN, BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'M SORRY FOR STARTING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
IT WAS JUST REALLY UPSETTING THAT YOU WENT TO HER WITHOUT GIVING ME A WARNING.
I KNOW, AND NORMALLY I WOULD NEVER DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS, BUT LILY IS NOT LIKE OTHER PARENTS.
WITH GOOD JUDGMENT, MORALS AND MATERNAL INSTINCT? AND WHEN SHE SAID THA SHE WAS GONNA TAKE CARE OF IT, I NEVER IMAGINED THAT YOU'D END UP INCARCERATED.
THE MOST FRUSTRATING PART IS SHE THINKS SHE DID TAKE CARE OF IT.
HEY, SOLDIER, EYES UP FRONT.
WELL, I'M, UH, I'M GLAD YOU LET ME BAIL YOU OU OR LET ME CALL CECE TO, 'CAUSE MISSING YOUR PROM JUST TO SPITE YOUR OWN MOTHER IS KINDA SOMETHING ONLY SHE WOULD DO, YEAH.
THANK YOU FOR GETTING ME TO SEE THAT, AND THANK YOU FOR BREAKING THE CYCLE OF CRAZY.
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BEEMER THAT MOM AND DAD GOT YOU? OH, I SOLD IT.
FOR THIS? AS IF.
I GAVE IT TO THIS GUY.
HE HAD THIS REALLY AMAZING IDEA.
IT GOES AROUND YOUR WAIST LIKE A BEL SO YOU CAN PU STUFF IN IT, LIKE A PURSE.
WOW.
THAT'S A REALLY SOUND INVESTMENT.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? NOTHING.
NOTHING.
IT JUST YOUR LIFE ISN' EXACTLY HOW YOU DESCRIBED.
YOU TOLD MOM THAT YOU WERE MAKING IT OUT IN L.
A.
I AM MAKING IT.
THIS IS WHAT MAKING IT LOOKS LIKE BEFORE YOU'VE TOTALLY MADE IT.
CAROL, I'VE ALWAYS THOUGH THAT YOU WERE REALLY, REALLY TALENTED.
IT'S JUST IS IT REALLY WORTH LIVING YOUR LIFE, YOU KNOW LIKE THIS? WELL, IT'S NOT FOREVER.
NOT ONCE WE GE SHEP'S MUSIC VIDEO ON MTV.
I'M TOTALLY THE STAR.
A MUSIC VIDEO EQUALS NATIONAL EXPOSURE.
IT'S THE BIRTH OF A NEW ART FORM.
REALLY? SHEP'S BAND? OKAY, I KNOW YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T THINK SO HAVING MET SHEP, BU THEY'RE ACTUALLY KINDA GREAT.
WELL, IF THEY'RE SO GREAT, THEN WHY DON'T YOU GIVE THEIR DEMO TO DAD? BECAUSE HE'S DAD, AND I'M DOING THIS ON MY OWN.
LISTEN, DON'T TELL ANYBODY ABOUT WHO WE ARE.
ESPECIALLY THEM.
WHY DO YOU CARE WHAT THEY THINK? AND BESIDES, BEING US IS AWESOME.
ALL THAT MONEY COMES WITH STRINGS ATTACHED, LILY.
PEOPLE TREAT YOU DIFFERENTLY.
YEAH, BETTER.
WOW.
COULD YOU SOUND ANY MORE LIKE MOM? OF COURSE I SOUND LIKE MOM.
SHE'S THE ONLY FEMALE ROLE MODEL I'VE HAD SINCE YOU BAILED ON US.
HEY.
I THINK WE'RE HERE.
I NEVER WANTED TO BE LIKE MY MOTHER.
I WANTED TO BE OPEN TO LIFE AND FEARLESS AND NOT ALWAYS THINKING THREE STEPS AHEAD AND CONSEQUENCES AND WHAT WOULD PEOPLE SAY OR WHAT WOULD MY FATHER THINK.
WELL, YOU HAVE, FOR THE MOST PART, WITH A FEW NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS.
THAT BEAUTIFUL DINNER YOU MADE YOU WERE GONNA PROPOSE, WEREN'T YOU? BUT YOU DIDN'T.
BECAUSE WHAT I DID TO SERENA MADE YOU FUNDAMENTALLY QUESTION THE KIND OF PERSON THAT I AM.
YOU'RE UNPREDICTABLE, THAT'S FOR SURE.
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, THAT WAS DAMN EXCITING.
YOU WERE ALWAYS SURPRISING ME.
I'M JUST DOOMED TO REPEAT MY MOTHER'S MISTAKES.
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO DO THAT? DAD, WAIT.
PLEASE DON'T WALK AWAY.
OUR MISTAKES ARE OURS ALONE TO REPEAT OR CORRECT.
I SHOULD FORGIVE SERENA FOR DEFYING ME.
OR FIRST MAYBE YOU NEED TO FORGIVE CECE.
OH, MY MOTHER DOESN'T NEED FORGIVENESS.
SHE NEEDS ELECTROSHOCK THERAPY.
YOU'VE GOT GOOD REASON TO BE ANGRY WITH HER THOSE MESSED UP VALUES SHE PASSED ON TO YOU.
I'LL FOLLOW YOU BACK.
UNTIL YOU LET IT GO, HOW CAN YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH YOUR OWN DAUGHTER? CECE'S NEVER GONNA CHANGE, LIL.
BUT YOU STILL CAN.
THANK YOU, RUFUS.
I'M GLAD WE CAN TALK, BUT AS FOR EVERYTHING ELSE, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE WE STAND RIGHT NOW.
EVEN AFTER 20 YEARS, YOU'RE STILL NOT SURE WHO I AM.
IT'S NOT THAT I'M NOT SURE.
IT'S JUST, I THINK YOU'RE STILL FIGURING IT OUT.
AH.
AND SHE STICKS THE LANDING.
SO IS INFORMATION ON THIS MISSION REVEALED ON A NEEDTOKNOW BASIS? BECAUSE I REALLY NEED TO KNOW.
CAROL.
THE SOCALLED DIRECTOR OF OUR MUSIC VIDEO TOOK OUR MONEY AND THEN JACKED UP HIS FEE, AND NOW HE'S HOLDING OUR VIDEO HOSTAGE, AND I AM A HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR.
YEAH, JUST 'CAUSE THIS DORK'S UNCLE IS JOHN LANDIS DOESN'T MEAN HE'S ABOVE THE LAW.
NO RICHIE RICH FILM SCHOOL KID RIPS OFF ME AND MY GIRL.
SHEP, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL.
RIGHT.
SHE'S MORE LIKE MY MUSE.
OH, SWEET HAND TOWELS.
SO ARE WE, LIKE, BREAKING AND ENTERING? SERIOUSLY? THE WINDOW WAS UNLOCKED, SO REALLY, IT'S JUST ENTERING.
AND I THOUGHT INVESTING IN PURSE BELTS WAS A BAD IDEA.
THANKS, LILY.
SINCE I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE FOLLOWING THE RULES, WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY HERE, FAR AWAY FROM THE PARTY, WHERE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY HAVING FUN? OWEN, CAN YOU KEEP AN EYE ON HER? WHAT? JUST BECAUSE MY IDEA OF A GOOD TIME ISN'T GETTING ARRESTED FOR BREAKING INTO SOME GUY'S HOUSE, I'M AUTOMATICALLY A STUCKUP GOODY TWOSHOES? IT DOESN'T EXACTLY MAKE YOU THE LIFE OF THE PARTY.
WHERE'S THE BAR? I THINK IT'S THIS WAY.
YOU MADE IT! YEAH! THERE WAS A LAST MINUTE CHANGE OF PLANS.
YEAH, I SPRUNG HER OUT OF THE POKEY.
YOU CAN THANK ME LATER.
WELL, I JUST SPENT TEN SECONDS TALKING TO YOU, SO CONSIDER YOURSELF REPAID.
HAVE FUN.
SO, YOU KNOW, NOT THAT I IMAGINED, UH, MUCH ABOUT MY TIME AT PROM, BUT, UM IT MEASURES UP.
DID YOU EVER IMAGINE YOURSELF DANCING AT PROM? THAT I DID.
WELL, I AM HERE TO MAKE DREAMS COME TRUE.
COME DANCE WITH ME.
BAILING YOU OUT OF PRISON AND DANCING WITH YOU A PROM IN ONE NIGHT? THAT'S YEAH, I'M HERE TO MAKE THINGS INTERESTING.
WE CAN DANCE IF WE WANT TO WE CAN LEAVE YOUR FRIENDS BEHIND 'CAUSE YOUR FRIENDS DON' DANCE AND IF THEY DON'T DANCE ? WELL, THEY'RE NO FRIENDS OF MINE I SAY, WE CAN GO WHEN WE WANT TO A PLACE WHERE THEY WILL NEVER FIND AND WE CAN ACT LIKE WE COME FROM OUT OF THIS WORLD LEAVE THE REAL ONE FAR BEHIND HEY, VAN DER WOODSEN, YOU WANT SOME? HEY, KEITH! SURPRISED TO SEE ME? CAROL.
HEY.
WOW.
YOU, UH, YOU LOOK AMAZING.
REALLY? EVEN MORE AMAZING THAN IN THE VIDEO YOU WON'T GIVE US? LOOK, I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I JUST, UH, I COULDN'T THINK OF ANY OTHER WAY TO GET YOU TO CALL ME SO I COULD EXPLAIN YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
NOTHING ELSE TO EXPLAIN.
I JUST WANT THE VIDEO.
HEY.
WHO IS THIS? IS SHE AVAILABLE? NAH, MAN.
NAH, SHE, UH, SHE WAS JUST LEAVING.
NO, I WASN'T.
WE WALK TOGETHER, WE'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREE I JUST CAN'T GE ENOUGH, I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH IT'S GETTING HOTTER IT'S OUR BURNING LOVE, AND I JUST CAN'T SEEM OH! TO GET ENOUGH, AH OH, IS THIS THE MOMEN WHERE YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH ME? IT IS, ISN'T IT? YOU'RE TOTALLY FALLING IN LOVE WITH ME RIGHT NOW.
SPARE ME, KEITH! THIS IS LOW, EVEN FOR YOU.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THIS, CHUCK.
YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT PROM IS TO ME! BLAIR, WHAT'S WRONG? I CAUGHT HIM WITH THESE.
THEY'RE ALL MARKED WITH NELLY YUKI'S NAME.
HE'S SABOTAGING ME.
MY MISSING CORSAGE, MY DRESS, THE LIMO AND HOTEL? WE PAID YOU 500 BUCKS TO SHOOT THAT THING.
WE WERE FRIENDS THEN.
I WAS GIVING YOU A SPECIAL RATE.
OUR RELATIONSHIP'S CHANGED NOW.
YOU CAN PAY ME THE BALANCE IN CASH OR I DON'T KNOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING SATURDAY? GROSS.
MY SISTER WOULD NEVER SLEEP WITH YOU.
YEAH, 'CAUSE SHE'S DATING ME.
SHEP, WE'RE NO DATING.
WE WERE NEVER DATING.
WELL, BOTH OF YOU DON'T KNOW CAROL VERY WELL, 'CAUSE, YEAH, SHE TOTALLY SLEPT WITH ME.
PRETTY FUN, TOO.
YOU SLEPT WITH YOUR MUSIC VIDEO DIRECTOR? I DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD A GIRLFRIEND, AND I BROKE IT OFF AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT.
BUT WHAT HE WANTS TO CHARGE US? MIGHT AS WELL BE A MILLION BUCKS.
AND I KNOW YOU PROBABLY THINK I SHOULD ASK MOM AND DAD FOR THE MONEY, BUT WHATEVER.
I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.
IT'S FINE.
NO, CAROL.
IT'S NOT FINE.
HI.

GIVE THIS TO HER.
IT'S TO THE PENTHOUSE AT THE PLAZA.
YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE WHO KNEW ABOUT THE SCRAPBOOK, DID YOU? CHUCK, I I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS, BUT THAT WAS REALLY SWEET.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE SHE HAD THE PERFECT NIGHT.

HER FUTURE'S AT STAKE.
WHICH IS WHY SHE NEEDS TO BE FAR AWAY FROM YOU.
THIS IS HOW IT'S GOING TO BE, MOM.
LILY'S STAYING WITH ME FOR A WHILE.
CAROL, JUST BE REASONABLE.
WE BOTH KNOW THE FIRS TIME THAT SHE BREAKS A NAIL, RIDES A CITY BUS OR GOD FORBID ACTUALLY STEPS FOOT IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL, SHE'LL COME RUNNING HOME.
WELL, THAT'S REALLY UP TO LILY, NOW ISN'T IT? JUST TELL HER TO SI TIGHT.
I'M COMING FOR HER.

WELL, PLEASE STOP.
I'M NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE, BUT I LOVE YOU, AND I KNOW YOU LOVE ME.
WELL, OF COURSE I LOVE YOU, MY DAUGHTERS, MY GRANDCHILDREN.
MY ONLY MOTIVATION IS LOVE.
ON THE CONTRARY.
YOUR MOTIVES ARE QUITE SUSPECT, SELFISH EVEN.
AND YOU HAVEN' ALWAYS DONE WHAT'S BEST FOR ME.
WELL, I'VE DONE THE VERY BEST I COULD.
YOU THINK SERENA'S A HANDFUL? I WOULD RATHER HAVE 20 DAN HUMPHREYS FROM BROOKLYN INSTEAD OF THAT BOY YOU LOVED FROM THE VALLEY.
WELL, YOU TOOK CARE OF THAT, DIDN'T YOU? AND YOU ENDED UP WITH SERENA AND ERIC AND THE LIFE YOU DESERVE.
IT WASN'T UP TO YOU TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF LIFE I SHOULD HAVE.
WHAT ELSE DOES IT MEAN TO BE A MOTHER THAN TO MAKE SURE THA YOUR CHILD FULFILLS HER DESTINY? WELL, I WANTED TO CREATE MY OWN DESTINY.
BUT THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT LOSING YOU, AND I WAS ALWAYS TOO AFRAID TO DO THAT.
UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON, EVIDENTLY.
MOTHER, PLEASE, I'M JUST ASKING YOU TO STAY.
YOU KNOW, BEING A MOTHER MYSELF, I'VE MADE MISTAKES THAT RIVAL IF NOT OUTSHINE YOUR OWN.
AND I FORGIVE YOU.
LUCKY ME.
YOU THROW ME OUT OF YOUR HOME, AND I GET FORGIVEN.
MOTHER, JUST SAY THANK YOU AND GIVE ME A HUG.
I MOST CERTAINLY AM NOT GONNA THANK YOU FOR THE TERRIBLE THINGS YOU SAID.
AND AS FAR AS THE HUG GOES, WELL, YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE EXACTLY AS YOU PLEASED, HAVEN'T YOU? HEY.
YOU OKAY? THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE HAPPIEST DAY IN HIGH SCHOOL.
SO WHY DO I FEEL SO SAD? LIKE SOMETHING'S ENDING? WELL, SOMETHING IS ENDING HIGH SCHOOL.
NOT JUST SCHOOL.
YOU'RE MY FIRST LOVE.
GOING TO MY SENIOR PROM WITH YOU IS SOMETHING I'VE WANTED SINCE I WAS 12 YEARS OLD.
AND HERE WE ARE, LIKE IT WAS MEANT TO BE.
YES.
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.
I'M SURE OF IT.
BUT NOW IT HAS AND WHY ARE YOU TALKING IN THE PAST TENSE? WE'RE STILL HERE.
I KNOW.
BUT THIS NIGH ALREADY FEELS LIKE A MEMORY.
JUST HOLD ME UNTIL THE SONG'S OVER.
LET'S NOT WASTE THESE LAST MOMENTS TALKING ABOUT IT.
OKAY.
BUT TONIGHT WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE STARS WE'LL PLAY OUR AIR GUITARS, 'CAUSE WE'RE 18 IT'S A PERFECT NIGH TO SING OUR PROM THEME HEY.
THERE YOU ARE.
WHERE'S THE PROM KING? WE BROKE UP.
WHAT? BUT EVERYTHING WAS SO PERFECT.
IT WAS LIKE A FAIRY TALE.
IT TURNS OUT FAIRY TALES END WHEN THEY DO FOR A REASON.
I REALLY WANTED TO GO TO PROM WITH MY HIGH SCHOOL BOYFRIEND.
AND NOW THAT I HAVE HE FEELS LIKE YOUR HIGH SCHOOL BOYFRIEND.
I'M SORRY.
ME, TOO THAT YOU ALMOST MISSED PROM BECAUSE YOUR MOTHER HAD YOU ARRESTED AND YOUR QUASI HALFBROTHER/EXBOYFRIEND WAS YOUR PROM DATE.
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY HAD A LOT OF FUN TONIGHT.
DAN AND I MADE UP, AND I KNOW THAT WHATEVER MY MOTHER DID, SHE DID OUT OF LOVE.
AND RIGHT NOW, I AM WITH EXACTLY WHO I WANT TO BE WITH MY BEST FRIEND.
SO THANK YOU.
WELL, IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO SINCE I GOT YOU ARRESTED AND EVERYTHING.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SUCH A BRAWLER.
NEITHER DID I.
I LEARNED SOME THINGS LAST NIGHT THE BIGGEST ONE BEING THAT I'VE REALLY MISSED YOU.
YOU ARE HIGH SCHOOL TO ME ALL OF THE BOYFRIENDS AND MEAN GIRLS AND AND TESTS AND TEACHERS AND OUR CRAZY MOTHERS WE WENT THROUGH IT TOGETHER.
WE RAISED EACH OTHER.
YOU'RE MY SISTER.
SO WHERE'S YOUR CAR? HOW DO YOU THINK I GOT YOU OUT OF HERE? YOU SOLD YOUR CAR? WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? WE'RE GONNA WALK? WALKING IN L.
A.
? WOW, SIS.
I HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO TEACH YOU.
COME ON.
IT'S US.
WE TRAVEL IN STYLE NO MATTER HOW WE TRAVEL.
DOOTDOO DOOTDOO DOOTDOO DOOTDOO SHOULDER PADS MAY COME AND GO, BUT A B.
F.
F.
IS FOREVER BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT SURE WHERE YOU'RE HEADED, IT HELPS TO KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING THERE ALONE.
NO ONE HAS ALL THE ANSWERS, AND SOMETIMES THE BES WE CAN DO IS JUST APOLOGIZE AND LET THE PAST BE THE PAST.
OTHER TIMES, WE NEED TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE AND KNOW THAT EVEN WHEN WE THINK WE'VE SEEN IT ALL, LIFE CAN STILL SURPRISE US, AND WE CAN STILL SURPRISE OURSELVES.

, GOSSIP GIRL.
Gossip girl here-- Your one and only source Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
Georgina? where are you? You can tell jesus that the bitch is back.
Emma.
Got a credit card fake i.d.
And i want bacardi and a boy.
That beautiful dinner you made-- You were gonna propose weren't you? I just don't know where we stand right now.
Tell me if what you feel for me is real.
It's just a game.
Chuck why did you just do that? - Because i love her.
I can't believe blair won! Yeah, who even voted for her? - Me.
about 150 times.
That was really sweet.
I just wanted to make sure she had the perfect night.
Where's the prom king? - We broke up.
But everything was so perfect.
Turns out fairy tales end when they do for a reason.
Like everything on the upper east side High school graduation is done a little differently.
Who needs pomp and circumstance when you have paparazzi? Ever since "gossip girl" broke my arrest It has been everywhere.
Do you know eric found it in "pravda"? You're famous because you got arrested.
Of course this happened to you.
I just can't wait for this day to be over.
The end of high school means the end of me on "gossip girl.
" No, she has plagued you more than anyone.
You were her first blast ninth grade, if i remember correctly.
It involved a white dress some rain And a recently docked aircraft carrier? Okay, let's just hope that my mug shot is The last thing she ever prints about me.
Look on the bright side.
Gossip girl does not report on college So this is your last day to be under her rule.
Okay can you just take my mind off of me? - Talk about anything.
Did he say it like - Anything but-- "i love her"? - "i love her"? - "i love her?" - i totally set myself up for that one.
B.
i don't know why you're acting like this is new information.
You know how chuck feels about you.
The problem isn't his feelings.
It's his inability to express them to the right person.
Who cares who he tells if he doesn't tell me? Does he even know that you and nate broke up? Have you not told him? It's not like we stay up at night Braiding each other's hair and having heart-to-hearts.
Then why are we still here? we've already paid the check.
Serena.
So we'll meet afterwards for the party.
will do.
Good luck up there, son.
i'm proud of you.
Thanks.
It's like getting a smile from the president.
And how are you? I'm good.
and you? Good, good.
i start my internship At the mayor's office next week.
so that's the big news.
As for today i got my mom and my grandpa To agree to sit together so that's something.
And things with you and - Blair? Yeah, it's over.
but it's okay.
It turns out,we just had to go through something to be sure.
Ever since it ended i can't stop thinking About how horribly i handled everything between us.
So i just wanted to say i'm sorry.
Thanks.
It means a lot.
and thanks for what you did last year.
If i hadn't taken the s.
a.
t.
s i'd never be going to n.
y.
u.
Right after i get back from my Backpacking trip through europe, of course.
Look at us--so civilized.
Hey stop by my party tonight.
Party? what party? After-grad party.
I figured i'd at least do something To commemorate my time here.
so i hope to see you there.
Both of you.
Is that a program? Yeah.
and smile.
Today's the first day of the rest of your life.
Way ahead of you.
This graduation is a celebration for us too.
No more mean girls.
We have suffered under their dictatorship for way too long.
Starting next fall, there'll be peace in the kingdom.
J.
wanna throw your hat in the ring? What are you talking about? Queen.
what else is there to talk about? The fact that there's not gonna be a queen next year? What would high school be without hierarchy? Bearable? a nice place to spend time? Ladies.
I thought we were matching our headbands under our caps.
What's going on? - your minions were just telling me About the search for the next queen.
They don't get to choose the next queen.
i do.
And take off that hideous scarf, penelope.
You can see if from space.
Not so fast j.
don't waste your time appealing to blair.
We don't listen to her anymore.
The coronation happens at midnight at nate archibald's party.
Whoever brings us the biggest piece of untold Constance gossip wins and you've got competition.
The new girl emma boardman transferring in next year.
Nice to meet you little j.
See you at midnight? unless you want to concede right now Oh and next year You don't want to take the subway to school.
You're more than welcome to sleep at my house.
it's on park.
Well so much for that.
At least we have all summer to prepare for hell.
No.
the cycle of abuse must be broken.
The monarchy ends tonight.
Hey.
why are you sitting here all alone? I'm waiting to approve a special insert My name was left off the list of graduates.
Fate sure knows how to run with a bit.
Well at least you're special.
Mr.
Humphrey? - Oh thank you.
"We apologize for the inadvertent omission "of Daniel Humphrey from the graduation program.
He is indeed graduating.
Congratulations Don.
" That's perfect.
I haven't seen you around.
Have you been looking? How are you? I'm fine.
No I'm great.
Um But I could be better.
I was wondering if you heard that I I'm I'm so happy high school's over.
Congratulations.
You too.
Everyone let's line up So we can make our way down please.
Girls on on side boys on the other Girls on on side boys on the other Right.
Well good luck up there.
How could I have forgotten? We reserved our seats together.
Oh Lily and Rufus! Oh We haven't seen you - Since we broke matzo together.
Hi.
You look wonderful.
-Thank you.
Love--It's put color in all of our cheeks.
We were talking on the way over here About what a wonderful couple you two make.
So we decided you should take the plunge like us.
Dating at our age is not enough.
Marry before it's too late.
Well It's not exactly Uh We're just enjoying the journey.
Well Apparently at one point We had a destination But that no longer seems to be the case.
Subtle.
Mm I was going for honest.
Dear friends colleagues As we stand here today We bear witness to a bright new beginning.
Just standing in front of him I-I couldn't do it.
I can't believe I chickened out.
It's okay B.
This is the beginning of something new.
Now we can all move on.
The possibilities are endless after all.
Yes.
To great things.
And so what if i'm not going to yale? you were recently incarcerated And I'm afraid to talk to Chuck because he might hurt me again.
This is our moment.
Nobody can take that from us.
I urge you to go out into the world And show them who you have become.
Not so fast.
You're not graduating until I give you my diplomas.
Mine are labels and labels stick.
Nate Archibald-- class whore.
Dan Humphrey-- the ultimate insider.
Chuck Bass--coward.
Blair Waldorf--weakling.
And as for Serena Van der Woodsen After today you are officially irrelevant.
O.
M.
G.
I know.
Congratulations everyone.
You deserve it.
Now please join me in welcoming the class of 2009.
Class please stand.
You were right B.
Nobody can take this day away from us.
Gossip girl is going down.
Gossip girl has ruined our graduation And it's only 2:00.
We have to stop her.
I don't know.
Messing with gossip girl? Think of the consequences.
You can't ask us to jeopardize our futures for your personal vendetta.
Besides she didn't even say anything about us Not even penelope.
Oh soup dumplings.
This is not my personal vendetta.
She attacked all of us and was wrong.
Completely.
Totally.
Well I'm gonna go do some damage control just in case So don't wait for me.
Well what about you two? Well of everyone here You guys probably have the most secrets you're hiding.
I'll gather intel.
I'll run some stats.
I'm sorry About before.
About what part exactly? the pre-graduation squabble Or the fact that you no longer want to marry me? What exactly is our problem anyway? You tried to give me money behind my back When i said no.
We both make mistakes.
But if we can't accept that about each other How do we move forward? I don't know.
But we can't go back.
I need to um see my guests.
Can we talk? Always.
Is something wrong? I know you have high aspirations for me So in the spirit of full disclosure There's something you need to know Something that may it may come out.
I'm intrigued.
Last summer I had an affair With an older woman.
Oh my boy.
Welcome to washington.
She was married at the time.
Go on.
And she Well she paid me.
Well Whatever happens i'll protect you.
Let's hope it doesn't come out.
Yeah.
Have you seen your girlfriend? - You don't know? - What? Blair and i broke up.
This party is not so hot.
There's a killer doughnut place around the corner.
Can you guys believe gossip girl? "the--the insider"? what is that? - A really good movie? - that's a tabloid tv show.
Come on.
seriouslyguys.
she can't keep getting away with this.
we all just have to band together and take her down.
Serena we just graduated.
gossip girl high school All these people backbiting and conniving-- Don't you think we should be moving on with our lives? Well high school's over But--but they're still my friends.
you're still my friend.
Yeah.
What you--you don't think so? No no i do but honestly School's finished And our parents That--that doesn't really look great.
Next year we're gonna be in different cities.
And when you think about it What's really keeping us together? So that's it? You--you get your diploma and you're just moving on? Well congratulations dan.
Have--have a good life.
So doughnuts? No let's just go home.
I want to--i want to get out of this suit.
all right.
The number of posts in the last six months about constance and st.
jude's is more than double Of the next mentioned school.
number one on our hit list Would seem to indicate a personal connection.
And i refuse to believe the students at our school are Any worse than those at horace mann or spence.
So gossip girl most likely goes to or went to constance.
Yeah exactly.
why else the focus? Well,i would also assume that she is our age.
The blasts all started when we were in the ninth grade.
An upperclassman simply wouldn't care.
So you're saying gossip girl's a senior,like us? Well,if she's a senior Then--then that means she's in the room right now.
So who could it be? Rebecca sherman? no her head's always in a book.
She's not paying enough attention.
Okay.
Not her either.
Then i submit nelly yuki.
Low profile Good with computers Many grudges mostly against me.
No i have been with her way too many times When gossip girl has sent out a blast.
There's no way it's her.
i'm gonna speed this up.
What are you doing? sending a tip to gossip girl.
Chuck,get the room quiet for me.
i'm way ahead of you.
If i could have everyone's attention please.
We'd like to thank you all for being here today.
Jonathan? what? Gossip girl is a guy? It's him.
look.
What just happened? What's going on? Tell 'em who you are.
Wait.
so if you're not gossip girl You must know who she is.
No.
i just hacked into her server over spring break.
I was bored.
And now we have access to every e-mail that gets sent to her.
I can't believe she gets All these posts that she doesn't report.
No.
no.
boring.
Apparently you dye your hair.
Yeah we have this theory That either she can't substantiate some of them Or she waits till the perfect moment for maximum damage.
I wish i could be more helpful.
No you--you have been so helpful.
Can i actually borrow you for a minute? I'd like you to help me dig deeper.
Nothing in here's good enough to beat the new girl Except for this.
No way.
would you really use that? I-i don't think i can.
If you did you'd totally win.
Yeah,and then i could abolish the monarchy forever.
You going to nate's party? No.
i thought vanessa and i would hit a movie instead.
And here we go.
all right It's your last party of high school.
Now i know you don't love your classmates But you just shared four years with them.
honor that.
And i suspect there may be a couple of people That you'd like to stay friends with,or at least one person.
Yeah.
yeah serena said kinda the same thing.
So h-how am i gonna get these doses of sage wisdom When i'm living at the dorms at n.
y.
u.
? I'll appear to you like obi-wan.
Now go young jedi.
All right.
bye.
have fun.
Our kids graduated high school today.
And i felt old.
And so i wanted to do something young and crazy And you're the only one i wanted to do it with.
Something I found in Chuck's room.
Well then I bet it's good.
Are you dressing for someone? Yes.
Someone I hope is finally ready to love me The way Cyrus loves you.
Cyrus told me.
You told Chuck how you felt and He ran away.
You seeing him tonight? Yes.
Don't let him get away again Oh.
.
Hey.
.
drunky.
Don't embarrass yourself.
Dan.
You're here.
There's something I have to tell you And it's only because I'm drunk And I'll probably never see you again.
I um.
Oh God.
I have to go.
Was she just about to tell me she loved me? I'm so glad we came.
BlairI need to talk to you.
Gossip girl knows.
Ominous.
But ill-timed.
You can tell me tomorrow or never.
About new year's? Look,the mean girls want the best piece of gossip In exchange for keys to the kingdom.
I just thought you'd want to know.
If gossip girl were gonna post that information She would have done it this morning.
and like I said,the mean girls don't control anything.
Blair, wake up.
You're not queen anymore.
You haven't been for a while.
And you're not going to be either If you tell anyone what you know.
I'm sorry I wasted my time on you.
You don't have what it takes.
You never did.
Now if you'll excuse me.
Bring me your leader.
It's not midnight.
My gossip's too juicy to wait.
I wanna talk.
I prefer to talk after.
What do you think about my coat? I like it.
Why? - And now? - Even better.
Andwhat about my headband? I admire it.
Andmy stockings? Oh I adore them.
And my dress? I worship it.
How do you feel about me? Say it.
I - What is it now? - Oh not again.
Serena Van Der Woodsen Just couldn't leave well enough alone.
Since she had to find out the truth about me I'm going to tell you the truth about everyone.
Every gossip bomb I've got is about to drop And if you've got a problem with that,take it up with her.
Ever wonder why Miss Carr left town? A little bee told me Dan Humphrey had s*x with her During the school play.
Remember the sparks between Humphrey's sis and Nate? Oh my God.
During a hot photo session.
Thank God it stopped at pg-13 Or someone could have ended up in jail like her brother.
Is that true?
What?
You were in jail?
And as for Blair Waldorf say "uncle."
We hear she kept it in the Bass family on new year's.
but rumor has it Chuck spent some time in Brooklyn-- Metaphorically speaking of course.
You slept with Jack? - You slept with Vanessa? Serena Van Der Woodsen here's looking at you.
Jack?Blair? Really? That's calculating.
Even for you.
I was sad and he tried to comfort me.
You call that comfort? More like collusion.
Like you didn't do that with the dregs of d.
u.
m.
b.
o.
I'm standing right here.
I can't believe you slept with miss Carr.
And you were in jail? I can't believe you let some guy take photos of you.
Wh-what was he doing there? No,no,no.
It wasn't as bad as it sounds.
Okay? You guys just stop it,okay? She's trying to create A divide between us.
This is exactly what she wants.
We can't let that happen.
You want to know something? I don't think it's her that created the divide.
I think it was you.
You're the reason we're on "gossip girl" in the first place.
If it wasn't for you we'd all be safe.
Okay that's enough.
We all did what she said we did.
You can't blame Serena for this.
Yes we can.
She declared war on gossip girl.
You brought this on us.
That's,that's not fair.
Serena was just trying to help everybody.
What do you know about anything Besides your label was the only one that was true.
You mean what she said about the "insider"? Are you crazy? You're friend with Nate Archibald You played on the soccer team.
You got into Yale You got the lead role in the school play You got published in "the New Yorker " You had s*x with a teacher.
Plus you dated the most popular girl in school And ignored the rest of us.
No.
I meant them.
You pretend not to be like us but you are to the bone.
And you should have known better.
Thank you.
Kudos S.
Way to go out with a bang.
Now what did you want to tell me before? Oh.
It doesn't matter now.
It just happened.
Leave me alone.
You're not mad at me because of that.
Just like I'm not mad at you about Vanessa.
Stop telling me what I feel.
We're just doing what we always do--finding excuses.
Well I won't do it anymore.
I know you told Serena you love me.
Serena heard wrong.
Last year you told Nate.
This year you told Serena.
You tell everyone but me.
Why can't you tell me? Is gossip girl right about you being a coward? That's not true and you know it.
Gossip girl can be right about you all she wants But I won't let her be right about me.
I will not be weak anymore.
You can't run.
You have to stay here and hear it this time.
Chuck Bass I love you.
I love you so much It consumes me.
I love you And I know you love me too.
Tell me you love me Then everything we've done-- All the gossip and the lies And the hurt Will have been for something.
Tell me it was for something.
Maybe it was.
But it's not anymore.
Oh my gosh.
Do you remember the casbah? That concert? Barely In the best way.
Oh my God.
You covered "how will I know" And you dedicated it to me And I sat there trying not to laugh.
Oh God.
I was so in love with you.
What are we doing? Things were so much easier when we were younger.
Unlike our kids we just jumped into things.
I mean, why can't we just be more like that Just figure it out as we go along? Maybe this didn't turn out to be The romance we thought it would be when we first met.
Well.
It's more like choose your own adventure.
Maybe it just wasn't the right time.
Maybe it never will be.
What if it is? What if we're just too stubborn to see it? I don't want to miss out.
Well Neither do I.
I don't have a ring So this will have to do.
Rufus.
What are you doing? Marry me, Lily.
Marry me.
I know that'll make me your uh your fifth husband.
So? Yes.
Give me your hand.
Come here.
Hey.
Don't worry about this.
Okay? Everyone's gonna get over it eventually.
When? Nate, high school is over.
If I don't fix this tonight Some of these people will never talk to me again.
And--and what happens next year? What she does this to the next Serena and Nate and Dan and Blair? Well.
What else can you do? It is too easy for her to sit behind a computer And not face the damage she's done.
No.
But she doesn't know that.
You didn't get to use your gossip.
Well here's something new-- I told chuck I loved him again And he didn't say it back again.
Blair.
I'm not gonna tell people that.
Why not? I'm giving you what you need to be queen.
I don't want to be queen.
I just wanted a chance to have a life in school And look what it almost made me do.
That's the thing.
You need to be cold to be queen.
Anne Boleyn thought only with her heart And she got her head chopped off So her daughter Elizabeth made a vow never to marry a man.
She married her country.
Forget boys.
Keep your eye on the prize jenny humphrey.
You can't make people love you But you can make them fear you.
For what it's worth You're my queen.
I choose you.
Thank you.
It's already been over an hour.
The bar's closing soon.
She's gonna come.
I know she is.
Whoa Whoa whoa.
Wait.
Wait.

This grudge match thing-- It d--it doesn't seem like you.
What's--what's going on? I don't want to be irrelevant.
Irrelevant? you're serena van der woodsen.
Gossip girl might be right about me But she's--she's wrong about you.
Without serena van der woodsen Who would i have dreamt about? I might have spent my whole life on the outside If you hadn't let me in Which i'm holding against you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Oh, that makes sense.

Team of what? Wait.

You wanted to meet gossip girl.

It's okay.

"Spotted--chuck bass in france.

I love it.
I am gonna put it up on my wall at brown As soon as I get back from europe.
oh! Come with me.
I chased a guy for years who wasn't that into me And going to a glorified state school.
My mother married an entertainment lawyer.
so I need to just stop moving And contemplate the failure of my life.
Well When you're ready to start moving again - You know I'll be here.
Yes of course I do.
Humphrey Where's your mind? I know it sounds crazy But I actually-- I kind of miss high school.
I miss blair waldorf and her daily ego demolitions Nelly Yuki stealing my lunch Even Chuck Bass who would get so close to talk.
Wow.
you miss Chuck Bass.
Well not as much as you probably miss Chuck Bass.
But yeah I uh I think it's safe to say That the nostalgia's officially begun.
Apparently the upper east side feels the same way about you.
What's up Dan Vanessa? Shouldn't you be getting the deputy mayorher coffee or something? Well I think she'd rather I gave her something else.
Yeah she made a pass at me.
god.
is she hot? Actually yeah she is.
You're both disgusting.
I don't want to be the guy gossip girl made me out to be.
So what are you gonna do? Go backpacking if you'll have me.
Well, it's too late.
i'm I'm taking someone else.
Oh, really? who? - It's me.
Him.
Yeah, we're gonna have a great time.
Melissa and i.
Oh.
really? Daniela.
Close.
It's Vanessa but thanks for trying.
Please let me go with you.
I'm always doing what everyone else wants me to do.
I want to do something for me.
And we'll just go as friends.
Don't worry.
it won't be anything romantic Unless you know we drink a little too much in Vienna one night.
How could you say no to that? Seriously.
As long as you take off that ridiculous tie So i can maybe try to picture you with a backpack.
What's wrong with my tie? Mm.
i need a coffee.
He's always wearing a tie.
So i'm the one who does the good deed And that guy goes off with the girl? It's good to be that guy.
Do youyou go here to n.

What are you doing here? What i should have done months ago.
In about five seconds your phones are all going to go off With the latest gossip girl blast.
She is nothing if not punctual.
allow me.
Remember all those secrets jenny amassed When she was trying to protect you nelly? Well now the world knows them too.
So looks like we have a winner.
Now if you don't mind How can you do this? Letting some girl from brooklyn carry on our legacy? Haven't you ever heard of a foreign queen? Besides her dad is marrying lily bass So i think that makes her richer than all of you.
Not enough.
Okay so starting next year no more headbands Except for this one.
Thanks you can keep the change.
oh big spender.
Hey mom.

Um i've already met some great people.

Is there anything else? I'd like to request a roommate-- blair waldorf.
She's my best friend and i just can't wait to live with her.
Serena.
Carter.
Aren't you supposed to be in dubayy? You know you can't lose me for long.
where you headed? Everywhere.
I have something you might want to know before you go.
I hope it doesn't have to do with blair.
No it has to do with you.
It's about santorini what you were looking for there.
While i was on the trip you so graciously gave me I found it again.
Only it's not in santorini anymore.
it's in fiji.
At least he was last week.
You found my father? Get in.
let's go.
Why aren't you in europe? I was in paris But only to get your favorite macaroons From pierre herm? And germany? To pick up your favorite falke stockings.
You know how i adore them.
What are you doing here then? You were right.
I was a coward running away again.
But everywhere i went You caught up with me.
So i had to come back.
I want to believe you But i can't.
You've hurt me too many times.
You can believe me this time.
That's it? I love you too.
But can you say it twice? No i'm serious.
say it twice.
I love you.
I love you.
mm.
There's three.
four--i love you.
Three words, eight letters.
Say it, and I'm yours.
I That's all I needed to hear.
What do you say we just forget thinking and follow our hearts? You're a part of this legacy, too, Nathaniel.
I don't want to owe him or my family anything.
Serena, where's Charles? Mom, what's wrong? Bart's been in an accident.
My father's dead because of your father.
I will stand by you through anything.
Why would you do that? Because I love you.
Well, that's too bad.
There's something you need to know.
Just tell me one thing.
Was it a boy or a girl? I had enough trouble with the idea of mom and Rufus dating.
But now I share a sibling with my boyfriend? It's over, isn't it? Andrew got caught in aiptide.
Yeah, if we had known, we wouldn't have even bothered you.
Is it over? We've already lost one son.
We weren't losing another.
You got here to N.
Y.
U.
? I'm starting in the fall.
Uh, I just transferred from B.
U.
And tell me if what you feel for me is real.
It's just a game.
Chuck, why did you just do that? Because I love her.
You're famous because you are arrested.
The end of high school means the end of me on "Gossip Girl.
" Congratulations.
You have a clean slate until college.
Her dad is marrying Lily Bass, so I think that makes her richer than all of you.
Carter.
I have something you might want to know before you go.
It's about Santorini, what you were looking for there.
You found my father? You were right.
I love you, too.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
Welcome back, Upper East Siders.
After a long, hot summer away, I see it didn't take much time for you to dirty up The clean slates I gave you.
My inbox is overflowing, so let's get to the good stuff, shall we? Spotted Chuck Bass up to his old tricks.
Poor B.
I guess nothing good lasts forever.
I'm Chuck Bass.
I know.
I wasn't expecting to see someone like you somewhere like this so early in the day.
I'm in need of refuge.
It's too hot.
Oh, it's never too hot.
Care to test that theory? What if I have a girlfriend? Chuck Bass doesn't do girlfriends.
Where's your limo? I gave my driver the day off.
Then I guess we'll have to find someplace else.
As for a certain leggy blonde by a Hamptons' pool Looks like Serena left big shoes to fill and someone finds them the perfect fit.
Well, I found it.
And just in time.
The car's here.
Now it's time to go Get you dressed? Mm.
No, I'm not leaving.
I don't think we have a choice.
As soon as we get in that car, it means no more beaches and no more bonfires and no more stalking the barefoot contessa through 1770 house.
Our summer in the Hamptons is officially over.
So, uh a sit-in? More like a lie-in, at least until the sun goes down.
You're you're sure your dad doesn't know? Oh, totally.
I mean, we hid all the evidence.
Look, Dan doesn't even know.
He's too busy pre-readin all his books for college.
And I snuck onto his laptop and, uh, might've disabled his "Serena Van Der Woodsen" Google alert.
Yeah, you know what happens when we get back to the city? Then it's Serena's problem.
As now, we made her a promise.
And it is very important to keep those even if they were asked via drunken text from a Turkish pay-as-you-go phone.
Our bags are packed.
The house is closed up.
But the real question remains.
Now that you've spent your whole summer drinking your coffee out of Cece's China, will it taste as good coming out of your "welcome back, kotter" mug at home? Sure, it was great out here, but I like the real world, too.
Since we and Lily it's a better-smelling, higher thread count version of the real world, but still Yeah.
He you guys aren't ready? Serena's gonna be home by 6:00.
I I mean, how can she even greet us when she gets here? Isn't she taking a vow of silence for a month at the ashram? I don't know.
"She, pray, love" thing of hers is great and all, I I just highly doubt she can keep her mouth shut a whole month.
Even so, it's time to leave.
And I think her month is up.
Uh, yeah.
I need to meet up with Vanessa, too, 'cause she apparently has something to tell me about how she spent her summer.
Wasn't she in Europe with Nate? Ladies and gentlemen, here they are! Well, it's a good thing the flight attendants dim the cabin lights over the Atlantic.
Mm, even better thing that my car got a flat on the way to Heathrow, and I missed the plane that I was supposed to be on.
Otherwise I would've been sitting in seat 3B of an entirely different plane, making out with an entirely different passenger in seat 3a.
All right, so now that we're back on our own turf, do I at least get your number? Maybe your last name? A little mystery you never heard anyone.
Really? Oh, come on.
Please.
You gotta give me something to go on here.
Okay.
Uh, well, we are going to the same school.
Yeah, and Columbia's kind of a big one.
I mean, especially when you factor in graduate school.
You caught that? See, you're a better detective than you think.
Well, my car is waiting.
Oh, are you done with that? I'll take it.
Yeah, sure.
Ew.
On second thought You have a problem with the Buckleys? Yeah, well, that right-wing nut Jeb called William Van Der Bilt a deviant for lobbying against D.
O.
M.
A.
Maybe that's because William Van Der Bilt called Jeb Buckley a cokehead and a cheater.
What, are you saying it isn't cheating if you get your congressional aide pregnant? Oh, my God.
You're Nate Archibald.
And you're Bree Buckley.
You pulled my hair during Clinton's inaugural ball.
Your redneck cousins tried to waterboard me at the Eastern egg hunt on the White House lawn.
It's good to see you again.
Yeah, take care of yourself.
Why not? It's better to wait.
How long? Oh, let's see Now.
What the hell is going on?! Blair I can explain.
Um, I'm sorry.
I didn't know he had a girlfriend.
Yes, you did.
She did.
I Shame on you, Ashley Hinshaw.
How could you do that? Pick up someone in a relationship?! Have you no pride? No self-respect? Okay, but I didn't know that you may have an Abercrombie campaign and the security code to Clooney's castle in Lake Como, but that doesn't give you the right to try to steal someone else's man! Now take your American girl hair and your pooreless skin and get out! Okay, you're crazy.
Hey.
Hi.
Oh, thank you.
It's been three hours.
I missed you.
Mm.
Well, let me make it up to you.
Let's get out of here.
Or we get stay.
So, uh, Jenny will take Eric's room.
With Chuck at the palace, Eric will take his room.
Oh, sweet thank you.
I really didn't want to sleep under Chuck's dirty girl scout painting.
Oh, and, uh, Dan Yeah I'll thank you when we get back from Brooklyn and when Lily gets back, we'll join you.
Oh, Mr.
Rufus, there are some packages I couldn't put upstairs.
Oh,what are you doing? Recycling? What? Whoa, whoa.
Oh my God! Uh, it's not what you think.
So much for "eat, pray, love.
" Well, you know, I guess she got the "love" part right.
You can't say anything.
Promise.
Dan? Hey Vanessa.
Uh, yeah, I was just about to head down there.
Serena is home.
Hello? Yeah, I'm gonna have to reschedule.
Oh, God.
Serena! Dan can't make it.
I think something's going down with his family.
Did he say what it was? As for Serena Van Der Woodsen? You left America a star.
Excuse me, please.
What the hell is going on? I don't know.
Please help.
But after your exploits in Europe Right here, Serena! You've come back a supernova.
Back up.
And yet, nothing explodes without a fuse.
I wonder what or who make yours.
Is, uh, Serena up yet? We were talking till late.
Uh, I think I heard her.
Whats up? Money your mother left us for emergencies.
Not to boast, but we haven't used a penny of it all summer.
Oh.
Well, thank heaven for salaried servants and an account at the beach club, right? Oh, well, I'm glad I have the number for city harvest.
This is all a little much.
A little much? Mom wanted everybody to feel welcome while she was away.
Or she's trying to bribe us.
What? No.
In fact, she got us a special treat for tomorrow a table in our name at Van Der Bilt annual charity polo match in Greenwich.
Lily thought it would be fun, so we are gonna go have fun for Lily.
Please show your family support by mimicking my expression.
You know, there'll probably be photographers there.
Are you gonna be okay? You might create another mob scene.
Oh, no, no.
Yeah, I'll be I'll be fine.
I'm really sorry about yesterday.
I thought after the whole arrest scandal, out of sight, out of mind.
I had no idea it would be worse when I got back.
Oh, you've apologized enough, Serena.
No one's blaming you.
Now that those vultures have a first shot of your return, I'm sure they'll leave you alone.
It's not like you're gonna get arrest again.
No, of course not.
Um, I have to go meet Blair to go shopping.
You can't go to a polo match without a hat.
I'm I'm gonna walk you out.
Uh, thank you for the escort, but I think I can walk 15 feet without hurting myself.
There was nothing out of sight or out of mind about your trip.
I know what happened.
I I don't know what you're talking about.
Serena, there was no ashram.
I went to ashram on a tour.
Dan, I appreciate your concern, but the little white lies that I tell my family are none of your business.
Rufus is my family.
You didn't just lie to him.
You lied to me.
All those e-mails about the the benefits of Bikram? "Ten easy steps to colon cleanse"? Turns out goop is good for something.
What's really going on here? Nothing.
Nothing.
I it was just a few nights of harmless fun.
That's that's it.
All right.
All right.
Where'd you get that? They're all over the internet.
Whatever is going on, you can tell me.
Thank you.
I I have to go.
I know it's a buyer's market right now, but that doesn't mean there's actually anything worth buying.
Why don't you just stay at The Palace? I'm done living in my father's shadow and that includes his hotel.
And running his company? Lily was doing an amazing job overseeing the board before she left.
Why not let her continue? What about you? Any word from the Van Der Bilt compound since you've been back? Not a word.
Tomorrow's the family polo match.
I mean, when I skipped out on the internship at the Mayor's office, I knew they'd be mad, but now I'm getting the silent treatment.
So if they're mad already, why don't you call the girl from the plane? No, I'm not gonna use Bree to send some message.
You're missing one key detail sleeping with the enemy is hot.
Why do you think I had the whole Ivanka thing? Look, I don't want to stir up stuff with my family.
Look, if you think they're done trying to control you, you're wrong, and while you're waiting for your proof, why not take Bree Buckley out on the town? Have some fun with a girl you like and show your family that you're your own man.
Being accepted for who you are is crucial, Nathaniel.
Like Blair accepts me.
Wait, you do what? I go to Europe for three months, and you turn from Jane Austen to Anais Nin.
Is there anything Chuck Bass can't get you to do? It was my idea.
No.
No, it wasn't.
Yeah.
We we had our honeymoon period, and it was perfect, but while other couples settle into a routine, we we determined to keep things interesting.
So Chuck plays the cheating b*st*rd, and I play the scorned woman.
I even get to choose who to humiliate models, tourists, upper west siders, I don't know if anybody ever told you this, but the honeymoon is supposed to end.
It isn't real.
The real part is when you settle down with each other.
The 3-month milestone.
It is not a milestone.
It's a gravestone.
Settling down means death less s*x, more silence.
We found a way to avoid that that works for us.
Wow.
You guys sure about that? I mean, if you don't mind me saying so, I Well, I think I know Blair pretty well.
Look, I would so like to retire any mention of the whole "Jules and Jim" thing.
All right.
But listen, the games may seem like fun.
Are you sure Blair's not just playing for you? Cause if she's not doing it for herself, too Well, things could get mess.
If you love him,then lock him down.
Open relationships only invite chaos.
Trust me.
I know.
It's not an open relationship.
We're completely monogamous.
It's just one of our games, like the rest.
Yeah, until it isn't anymore, playing the scorned woman.
And actually being the scorned woman is a slippy slope.
B, college is about to start.
What happens when one day you don't get there in time, and he actually kisses someone else, or worse? He wouldn't.
Ugh.
I still have no idea why they're following me.
Oh, please.
Spare me, S.
I get every edition of "Hello!" and "Ok!" there is.
I know what you did this summer, and who.
Cristiano Ronaldo? I hope you got your shots before you traveled.
Should I be worried? No.
No, I just had a great time.
I just wish that they would leave me alone.
Oh.
Is that why you got your hair blown out? Listen to your quality problems.
Serena's being chased by paparazzi, my dad and sister are house-sitting a penthouse, and I have a farmer's tan.
All right.
Okay.
You got me.
The good life is is actually it's pretty good.
What, uh, what was so important that you had to bring me here to tell me in person? I hope it's not about Nate.
Oh, we hooked up one night in Prague, but it was not a big deal.
But after I came back and started hanging out at this place Please tell me you're not working here.
I am so done serving coffee.
Thank God.
Just made some new friends one in particular.
He was here this morning.
Oh.
So you are dating someone.
His name's Scott, and I think you guys would really like each other.
We actually met him here in the spring like 5 seconds.
He just transferred.
We've been hanging out,and,okay, maybe there's been a little bit of flirting.
Oh.
Thank you.
Here, let me get it.
Okay, wait.
Why do you have a knockoff designer wallet? I thought you hated intellectual property theft.
Oh, it's to hold all your $100 bills.
Do you know how hard it is to break one of those things? I don't even know why they make them.
I'm kidding.
Sort of.
It not a knockoff.
It's a graduation present from Lily, as is what's in it.
And you know what? I I thought I'd never use it, but have you seen the stitching? Oh, my God.
Dan Humphrey's been seduced by wealth.
It had to happen.
Even Frodo eventually gave in to the power of the ring.
Oh,come on.
I'm still me.
I just have a nicer wallet.
And as for your friend, I'd love to meet him.
How about tomorrow? We can do Brooklyn things like go to the Dumpling Truck and play "signed or unsigned" on the promenade.
That sounds great, but I, uh, I have to do this thing for my dad, so Okay.
We'll find time.
Walk you to the subway? Nah, I'm I'm on the 6.
Oh.
Right.
See? Still me.
You left these.
Oh.
thanks.
These are my friend's.
Mr.
Humphrey, the camera people are in the trash outside.
Your trash.
All right.
Thanks, Vanya.
I don't understand.
Serena's arrest was months ago.
Why did they still care about her? Her clothes.
Her hair.
Her hair.
Her style.
What do you know that I don't know? Where have you been? I've been calling you for an hour.
I was with Nate.
Why? Nate.
No reason.
I've arranged a little go-see at a modeling agency downtown.
We should pick someone out together, take her back to my place.
Or we could just stay in.
Whatever you want.
No.
It's fine.
We'll go.
We'll go.
I'll go get my purse.
Oh.
I I see the cat's out of the bag.
And, uh, topless on Valentino's yacht.
Ooh, that's not fair.
Everyone's topless on Valentino's yacht.
What about this one where she's dancing on the table? Uh, well, that's what you do in Barcelona.
And the one where Prince Harry's doing shots off of her that's what she did in St.
Andrews some of these pictures he the same guy in them, but you can't quite make him out.
I wonder who he is.
Where you headed, beautiful? Carter.
I was in the neighborhood.
No, you weren't.
Gossip Girl said you'd returned.
I wanted to see you.
Well, you've seen me.
Now you can go.
We need to talk.
No,we don't.
Mm.
I know what you're doing.
You can't avoid what happened forever.
Watch me.
Oh, no! Spotted Serena Van Der Woodsen giving Carter Baizen the slip.
But what happened between them when TMZ was M.
I.
A.
? Something tells me the truth is just out of focus.
Well, you were right.
Your family? Wants me exactly where I used to be, except they actually gave me the wheels to get there this time.
Check this out, "Nate, most unfortunate you missed out on the summer.
Good thing fall internships begin next week.
" Sorry, man.
Don't be.
It's about time I broke off from them once and for all, and I think I know how I'm gonna do it.
I just don't know why he felt he had to lie to me.
I don't think it was really a lie.
Thank you.
He said he was taking the subway when he had a limo waiting, and not to mention, he told me he was helping his dad tomorrow, when Gossip Girl says he's attending the Van Der Bilt's polo match in a Dior suit.
Oh, is this the part where no one pretend to know what Dior means? I mean, why keep these things secret from me? Is he worried that I'm gonna judge him? I wonder why he might even think that.
I'm not judging! I get it.
If I had a limo that followed me around, I'd take it, too.
I'm his best friend, and I support him no matter what even if he were rich and dressed like Truman Capote.
Yeah, you should probably tell him that.
I should.
Too bad he's that polo match with his family? His whole family? Yeah, and Nate's family, and I'm sure Blair and Chuck will be there, if the murder-suicide I predicted hasn't happened yet.
Well, why don't you just call his dad? From what you've said, you sound pretty close to him.
Say you haven't seen a lot of Dan lately and you'd like to go.
You think I should invite myself to a charity polo match? Yeah.
Just show up, tell Dan how great he looks in his suit, and if he has room, you'd love a ride back to the city in his limo.
I've never been to a polo match.
Maybe you can get a plus one.
Maybe.
Needs a sandwich.
She looks just right to me.
Adam's apple.
Blair.
Catalogue! Chuck, none of these girls are even worth humiliating.
Looking in the mirror will do that for them.
Is everything okay? What's going on? Nothing's going on.
Why? This is one-stop shopping, and you're acting like everything last season.
I thought you wanted to play.
I did.
I do.
I did.
The summer was great.
We had a lot of fun.
But maybe summer's over.
Okay.
If that's what you want.
Is that what you want? I want you to be happy, however that's achieved.
Let's go home.
It, uh, looks Smaller? Yeah.
Your mom bought these for me for cotillion, with Cece.
How's she doing? Um, not great.
And the longer my mom's gone, the more I worry that grandma's treatments aren't going well.
But your dad's been doing a great job holding it all together.
At least, he's pretending to.
Well, having your summer plans change, stuck in charge of two kids that you didn't raise in a house that you don't own Yeah, I know.
It sounds like a reality show premise.
Uh It's gotta be getting to him.
Plus the whole thing with Serena.
The last time she went off the deep end, she got really messed up.
Yeah.
I wonder what really happened this summer.
Well, now that Rufus knows, maybe we'll find out.
What is it? Grandma? No, it's you.
I'm sorry.
He found out.
Uh, before I get angry, why don't you tell me what happened? Because I'd really like to not use my imagination when it comes to these pictures.
You don't have to if you look close enough.
I I'll shut up.
Rufus, I know I shouldn't have lied, but I was in Europe and I had just graduated, and I got a little carried away.
And what happens in summer stays in summer, right? Look, the only reason I didn't tell you is because I thought if I did, you'd think I'd gone off the rails again.
Did you? No.
No, ev everything I said to you last night was true.
I I'm done.
We'll put it behind us, then? And in what is perhaps an ironic twist, due to your current social status, the polo society has asked if you will throw in the first ball at the match tomorrow.
I'd love to.
I'll go call 'em back.
Your mom will be proud.
Yeah, I I didn't want to alarm my dad any further or anything, but, uh, there was one guy who was in a lot of those pictures with you who who was that? Carter Baizen.
We traveled together at the beginning of summer.
But then things got weird, and and now he's stalking me.
He he's been stalking me ever since.
And, uh, I don't know what to do.
He won't leave me alone.
So hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
W what what are you saying? Look, if you hear from him or see him, just please keep him away from me at all costs.
I'm worried what he might do.
It's Blair, leave a message.
Hey, Blair, it's Dan.
I I know I'm not someone you want to hear from late at night, or any hour, but I need your help.
Uh, call me.
This just in an unlikely alliance is forming on the Upper East Side.
Yeah mom, everything's great.
I have been waiting all summer for reed to start, and tomorrow's the day I get to do what I came here for.
Too bad it may be too late to do any good.
Last year, I had to go to the white party as your date in a dress that I made myself.
And this year Oh, Mrs.
Jennifer Humphrey.
When did you get married? It doesn't matter, okay? It's engraved! Miss Van Der Woodsen.
Would you like me to tell them not to? Uh, no, it's okay.
I won't do anything worth publishing, not even a smile.
I should find Blair.
Well, the bad news is, your last name's Buckley.
But the good news is knowing this information made you a lot easier to find.
Yeah? Well, I knew you couldn't stay away.
Hey, there's someone I want you to meet.
Oh, my God.
Is that Grandfather.
Nathaniel.
So nice to see you.
You, too.
And who is this? This is Bree Buckley, my date.
And I believe this belongs to you.
Hello, Nate.
Would you come with me for a second? Okay.
Oh, hello.
How nice to see you.
How's your terrine? Bland.
How's your julep? Weak.
Isn't that Alexandra Richards? Yes.
Look at her, floating through the party with her perfect pout and flawless figure.
You know, if were still in the game, she'd be a great score.
But we're not, right? No, we're not.
Everything is so white.
Welcome to my world.
There's Dan.
How could you tell? You met him months ago.
Nice suit,right? And I guess I have a good memory.
Well, he's alone.
Now's your chance.
I'm gonna go to the bar.
You want anything? No.
I'm not gonna leave you here by yourself.
Let's find Jenny, someone to keep you company.
No excuses.
I'll be fine.
Just go.
Uh I'll wait by the bar and get us drinks.
Okay.
Okay.
What? Vanessa! What are you doing here? Nice suit.
Huh.
What, you couldn't judge me enough in New York? You had to follow me to another state to do it, too? No, I came to tell you that I'm Humphrey.
Come on.
It's showtime.
If you don't mind, Dan and I are in the middle of something.
If you don't mind or even if you do Dan's coming with me.
I I have to go.
I'm sorry.
So am I.
Thank you.
Are you Rufus? I'm a friend of Vanessa's.
I'm I'm Scott Adler? Oh, right.
I'm glad you guys came.
It's nice to meet you.
I It's okay.
It's just a handshake.
No.
I I'm sorry.
It's just,um I've always been a fan of your music.
Carter? Waldorf.
Can't say it's good to see you.
No, you can't, not after what I'm about to tell you.
The invitation you got to come this party wasn't exactly what you thought.
Spare me.
Where's Serena? This him? You've been served.
What the hell is this? It's a restraining order.
This says I have to stay away from Blair Waldorf.
Yeah, and until further notice, you'll find me by Serena's side.
Step within 100 feet of me and you'll be arrested.
And about how far you think he is from me? Yeah, I don't think he's far enough.
I agree.
Security! Hey! Hey, uh, what's going on here? Oh, your friends, uh, are trying to have me removed.
Right, because you're stalking me.
Look, you don't have to talk to him.
You told them was stalking you? You wanna tell them the truth or should I? What's the truth? Yeah, Carter.
What's the truth? Sooner or later, you're gonna be alone, with no one taking your picture.
What will you do then? Wait, Serena.
What what is he talking about? Miss Van Der Woodsen, the first chukker is about to begin.
You need to take position for the first throw in.
Yes, of course.
Thank you, Nacho.
Uh, goodbye, Carter.
Serena, wait! No, wait, wait, wait.
You gotta tell us what's going on! Later! I'm Chuck Bass.
Alexandra.
I don't believe it.
Uh, well, all right, if she can't explain it, Then maybe Carter You found a bootleg copy of that concert? Wow.
Yeah, I bet I have a recording off the board somewhere.
I mean, I could get it to Vanessa for you if you'd like.
I'd love that.
In fact, um Hey.
I'm gonna borrow this horse.
Forget a grand entrance.
Everybody knows it's the exit they'll remember.
Hey.
I just got your text.
What's what's going on? You didn't tell me that you were bringing me to a family event.
W so? Listen, I really like you.
And if your being here happens to piss off my grandfather, to be honest, I figured you'd like that.
You're right.
Hey, look, normally I'd totally be on board the "let's piss off grandpa train," but what don't you know is that currently, my family isn't speaking to me, which is something that, unlike you, I'd like to change.
Being on a row at a Van Der Bilt charity event doesn't exactly send that message.
I didn't know.
I'm sorry.
Look, my family is used to controlling me like yours obviously does.
And I rebelled, like you obviously do, except I took off to Europe.
A year into it, I found out that my cousin who's, like, a sister to me, got stood up at the altar, and I wasn't there for her because I was trying to prove some stupid point.
I'm just trying to find my way back in.
I happened to bump into you along the way.
Well, I'm glad you did.
And despite what it may look like, the main reason I tracked you down was because I wanted to see you again.
If that means keeping a low profile, I'm up for it.
I know that secrecy is a lot to ask for.
I really can't risk making my family more upset right now.
Hey, don't worry.
I'm good at secret relationships.
I've had a bit of practice.
I figured you weren't planning on riding all the way back to the city.
Why won't you leave me alone, Carter? You're not my boyfriend.
No, but I seem to be the only one you tell your secrets to.
Well, I guess that was a mistake.
Dropping your dress, stealing a horse? All it is is a cry for attention.
I don't need to cry for attention.
I'm getting plenty on my own, in case you haven't noticed.
Yeah, plenty from everyone except the one you want it from.
That's not true.
He didn't want to see you, Serena.
No, that's that's not what happened.
We spent a month chasing him down and then we found him.
Well, maybe he didn't get my message.
Or he didn't realize who I was.
Or he didn't realize who his daughter was? Serena,what if your dad didn't want to see you? Who cares? Who the hell is he not to want you? I would've stayed all summer with you.
But after that, you ditched me and ran again.
Well, there the two of you are.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
We were just discussing how we were gonna get back to the city.
Well, I'll get you home.
No, thank you.
We'll find o own way.
I'm not gonna be taking the internship, grandfather.
I hope you can understand that.
Of course I can.
How many times must I tell you, Nathaniel? I want to be your family.
Work wherever, date whomever.
I won't stand in your way.
I, uh, just want you to be happy.
I almost believe you.
That's enough for me.
And if I'm right in guessing that you two are hiding out here because Miss Buckley would prefer to keep her presence unknown Why search for a cab and risk being seen? Okay.
I'm giving it back in the morning.
Tripp, it's me.
Remember how we've always wanted to do something about the Buckleys? I think I may have found a way.
Excuse me.
Have you seen Mr.
Bass anywhere? You just missed him.
He left about five minutes ago.
Was he alone? Well, there was a woman who left about the same time.
Was she blonde? Tall, stunning and every man's fantasy? Spotted Blair Waldorf learning that just because you get out of the game doesn't mean someone isn't waiting on the bench to take your place.
I know stuff's going on with your family, so I'm just gonna go.
Ok, why do you come here? Honestly, right now I'm not sure.
Maybe people just change.
Maybe it okay if we grow apart.
Vanessa, I'm I'm not changing.
You're at a polo match in a $3,000 suit.
And your name's in the program.
And after I take a bus across the state line to apologize, you ditch me for Blair Waldorf and totally disappear.
Cece set me up with this suit, all right? And Jenny got a dress, too.
If you'd also like to make her feel bad about it.
As for Blair, it's not like we're shoe shopping or sipping Martinis.
There there's something going on with Serena.
And what is that? I I wish I knew.
All I do know is that Lily's mother is very sick.
My dad is struggling keep it together, not to mention my family is just generally in the middle of a massive transition.
So, please, please, give me a break with the "rich people suck" thing.
I don't care if you're rich, which you aren't, by the way.
Ride in a limo, break a hundred.
That's fine.
But if you're gonna be in this world, be yourself in this world.
'Cause I actually like that guy, and I hope he's the one who turns up at N.
Y.
U.
What's so funny? Old habits die hard.
Don't worry.
I'll find my way.
Anybody seen a girl in an orange dress? Chuck! Where is she? What are you talking about? Do you really expect me to believe You don't have her stashed here? I came back from the party because I had a headache.
Didn't you get my messages? I must have left my phone on the table.
What if we need games? What if without them we're boring? We could never be boring.
You say that, but I know you.
You're Chuck Bass.
I'm not Chuck Bass without you.
Running to get here all the way from Connecticut was pretty exciting.
Do you know where Alexandra lives? How about we stay in instead? Well, that wasn't so much fun, was it? Depends on your definition of fun.
I'm sorry I brought you.
The Humphreys are going through a lot, and I don't even know if Dan and I are even still friends.
I know they're dealing with stuff, um, but they seem like good people to me.
And you and Dan have been friends for so long, maybe you shouldn't write that off because of one argument.
Let's not even talk about it anymore.
Are you sure? Cause if you need to talk I don't I think I've done enough talking for one night.
And I thought one of us should finally make the first move, maybe turn this night around.
I'm glad you did.
Growing up means one thing independence.
I'll be right back.
We all want it.
Sometimes we use other people to try to get it for ourselves.
Waiter, this glass is dirty, and I've been waiting far too long.
Well, I apologize, ma'am.
Surely there's some way I can make up for the poor service.
I can think of a few ways.
Sometimes we find it in each other.
The party you are trying to reach is not available at the moment.
Please leave a message.
Hey, it's Serena again.
I don't know if you're getting these message or if you even check this number, but I just want you to know that I'm not gonna stop trying to get your attention.
I'm gonna do whatever it takes for however long.
Bye.
Sometimes our independence comes at the cost of something else and that cost can be high.
I hope I'm doing the right thing.
You wanted to keep Serena out of the papers.
Dad, this is the way do it.
You own all the pictures now.
Oh, not all of them.
There is still one photographer that my group hasn't been able reach yet.
Because more often than not, in order to gain our independence we have to fight.
Can you guarantee that these will run in Europe and Asia? I'll try my best.
Good, 'cause I wanna make sure my father sees these wherever he goes.
Never give up.
Never surrender.
Gossip girl here your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
You got into Brown.
The letter came while you were away.
Congratulations.
You said you could call in a favor at N.
Y.

It's gonna be up to you to wow him.
You got your money.

Y.
U.
Now.
Great.
Then I'll see you next year.
Oh, my god.
You're Nate Archibald.
And you're Bree Buckley.
It's good to see you again.
I made some new friends, one in particular.
Oh.
So you are dating someone? His name's Scott, and I think you guys Would really like each other.
Yeah, mom, everything's great.
I have been waiting all summer for reed to start, And tomorrow's the day I get to do what I came here for.
I know secrecy is a lot to ask for, - But I really can't risk making my family more upset right now.
Don't worry.
I'm good at secret relationships.
What if your dad didn't want to see you? Who cares? Who the hell is he not to want you? I would've stayed all summer with you.
Vanessa, I'm I'm not changing.
I don't care if you're rich, which you aren't, by the way.
If you're gonna be in this world, be yourself in this world.
Is there anything else? I'd like to request a roommate Blair Waldorf.
She's my best friend, and I just can't wait to live with her.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

Gossip Girl.
Every fall, confident high school seniors transform into nervous college freshmen.
They leave their parents' homes for the hallowed halls of higher education.
And like any new venture, starting college holds the promise Of limitless opportunity.
The opportunity to conquer a new territory * The facts and the figures * * They overwhelm and stifle * * Everything * * That you thought you knew * Or to try and be a little less lonely * The facts and the figures * * They overwhelm and stifle * But just because the opportunity presents itself * That you think make a difference * Doesn't mean everybody is ready to take it.
Mmm.
You're so sweet to see me off.
I can't believe N.
Y.
U.
orientation week.
is finally here.
I have to object to you living in the dorms.
Fluorescent lighting, communal showers, Public school girls? There's a place for that, and it belongs in the back of a video store.
It's not for long.
I can't rule the N.
Y.
U.
Masses from the upper east side.
I need to spend time in the dorm to establish myself as queen.
It's not Constance, Blair.
The only queens at N.
Y.
U.
are the ones with tickets to see Liza at carnegie hall.
Chuck, I trust that when you say, "never drink absinthe with Daniel Baldwin," You know what you're talking about.
But when I say the first week of college means.
Scared, vulnerable freshmen needing someone to guide them, That I know what I'm talking about.
And I'm very excited for you.
So you haven't called Vanessa yet? - No, she's the one who's out of line.
She's gotta call me.
Or you could just get over it.
After all these years, You guys are finally gonna be at the same school.
I guess you're right.
It's probably not the best idea To be avoiding my only friend at N.
Y.
U.
For the record, Dan, I don't think You're gonna have any trouble making friends there.
Right, because the The world of greenwich village intelligentsia is Dan Humphrey's natural habitat.
You're so lucky.
N.
Y.
U.
is exactly the right place for you.
Like Brown is for you.
Serena? Um Sorry.
Uh, yeah.
You know what? I should finish packing.
But good luck, Dan.
Hey, I'm sorry.
Are you Dan Humphrey? Uh, yeah.
Like the Dan Humphrey who was published In the "20 under 20" issue of "the new yorker"? Uh, yeah.
Large coffee, please.
I'm Katie, and I'm not usually an eavesdropping stalker.
It's just that I read your piece, and it was amazing.
What? Really? Wow.
That's that thank you.
Yeah, well, at first I hated you because I also submitted, But then I read it and I was like, Okay, fine.
I accept defeat at your hands, Dan Humphrey.
Anyway, I have a writer's group.
We meet every week.
We're meeting here at noon tomorrow.
You should come.
Car's downstairs.
You ready? - As I'll ever be.
Today's a big day, You and Dan both off college.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
Uh, I should get going.
Your mom's so proud of you.
So am I.
Hey.
Uh, Scott, you remember Dan.
Dan, this is Scott.
Yeah.
No, it's, uh, it's good to finally officially meet you.
Uh, so are you two dating now? Last I heard you were just friends Yeah, you actually have to call me to find out what's going on in my life.
Oh, well, okay.
I didn't realize we were speaking.
Oh, god.
Of course she's in a limo.
Ew.
Let's make it clear from the start.
We don't know each other here.
Works for me.
Me, too.
Well, hello, sis.
I assume you need a few ounces of study aid for Brown.
No.
I need a place to stay.
I'm not going to Brown.
Yes, we may all be freshmen and new to N.
Y.
U.
and the dorms, but that doesn't mean We have to embarrass ourselves.
I can tell from looking around this room that none of you are from new york city.
Actually, I'm from Riverdale doesn't count.
Anyway, I won't be holding The sad truths of your hometowns against you.
In fact, I want to help you.
For example, who can tell me Which is the only club to be seen at on a saturday night? I read marquee.
Wrong.
You should never be seen at a club on a saturday night.
It's strictly bridge and tunnel on the weekends.
You're welcome.
Now Dorota and I have put together some gift bags filled with essentials for everyone.
I think you don't need week to run school.
You do it in one day.
I know.
This is going even better than I'd hoped.
And the best part is I seem to have a single.
Sorry I'm late.
Blair? Blair Waldorf? Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe it! We're roommates! Rah rah, sis boom bah.
Georgina's pulled a coup date.
Welcome to college, b.
This is gonna be a blast.
Following me to N.
Y.
U.
? Becoming my roommate? I'm gonna have Dorota file a restraining order.
I mean, you're overreacting.
The roommate thing is just a coincidence.
Besides, my parents said it was either bible camp or college, - So go, bobcats! - So you're not in love with jesus anymore? Oh, I still hold him in my heart, But jesus and I have redefined our relationship.
You mean he dumped you because he found out you were satan! This could actually be a good thing, Blair.
Look.
Manolos.
Size 7, just like you.
Let me know if you want to borrow.
I'll win, you know.
I ruled at constance and I will rule here, - And you can't stand in my way.
Are you still playing this tired old game? Oh, please.
Like you're not? No, I'm not.
I'm actually here for a fresh start.
Oh, no.
Vanessa, you're in our dorm, too? Yay! Your dorm? Yeah, um, my room's just down the hall.
So, uh That's awesome.
Oh! Isn't this so pretty? I'm gonna hang it up.
* The facts and the figures * * They overwhelm and stifle * Oh, Miss Blair.
What are we going to do? Call police? No.
We're going to throw a party.
I go to Masa, see if they will cater.
Pardon me.
I was packing and talking to Blair about her classes, And then it hit me.
I wasn't excited about any of it.
I don't know what I want to do yet, And and going off to a new place to figure that out? I don't know.
I'm just I'm not ready for that.
Look, sis, for people like us, A college degree is just an accessory, Like a Malawi baby or a poodle.
Well, it's an accessory my mother really wants me to have.
So you want to hide out at the Bass cave until you figure it out.
Yeah, if it's okay with you.
Nobody knows about this,Not even Blair.
Blair would be even more upset than my mother.
I couldn't help but notice you and Carter Baizen At the Van Der Bilt Polo party.
This doesn't have anything to do with him, does it? No, absolutely not.
I haven't even seen him since then.
Good.
Just one favor.
I'm having a meeting here tonight, So if you can clear out for a few hours.
Chuck, I don't mind if your dealer comes by.
Jesse is in St.
Barths this week.
This is something more legitimate.
You know the old art deco bank On 72nd between Madison and park? The one that went under last month? I want to make it into a speakeasy.
In the front an elegant restaurant, But down in the vault, an after hours locale, devoted to indecency, disreputable behavior and all manner of debauchery.
A kind of homage to the last time the market crashed.
The harder the times, The harder people want to party and forget about it.
Chuck.
This is really a great idea.
I I can't believe Blair hasn't told me about this yet.
She doesn't know.
Nobody does.
I just wanted to wait till I was sure it was going through.
You know, my father turned his first profit by the time he was 22.
I hope to do it by the time I'm 21.
* It's a fragile world * * Susceptible to * Let me guess.
Uh, women in literature, professor Schweik? You know I'm a sucker for stories about scorned women.
I got the same.
I think the universe is trying to tell us something.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I should have called you.
No, it's it's okay.
I wouldn't have wanted to call me either After the way I came down on you at the party.
Um So Scott? Yeah, he's he's so great, And he really wants to get to know you.
Oh, my god.
I have so much to tell you.
You are never gonna guess who lives in my dorm.
Hey, guys.
Oh.
Oh! - Sorry to interrupt.
I just saw you, and I thought, um So I really just want to apologize for everything that happened in the past.
I've got my meds straightened out, And I'm really in a much better place now.
So I come to N.
Y.
U.
hoping for a fresh start, - And who do I get as my roommate? Blair Waldorf.
What? - I told you we have so much to catch up on.
I mean, I wish I had some other friends here, you know? You guys are are really lucky to have each other.
Anyway, I should go.
Okay, this is probably too much, But would you guys want to have a cup of coffee with me? Uh Look, Georgina, I appreciate that you want a clean slate, but I think it would kind of be too much.
I'm sorry.
No, of course.
I I mean, I I totally understand.
I'd feel the same way.
I'll see you around.
Maybe we were a little bit too harsh.
What? It's it's Georgina.
And you're Dan.
And you're Vanessa.
This is a fun game.
I'm sorry.
I just thought you were A little bit more forgiving than that.
Are you are you really trying to make me the bad guy here? No, it's just we want a fresh start and and so does she.
Okay.
I know you're new to the whole school thing, But you don't want Georgina as your friend.
I mean, she's gonna scare everyone away.
Georgina.
Hey.
What's gonna happen next week when we start classes? That's why we have my family's apartment.
And plus, you know, all this sneaking around, making sure the doorman doesn't see you, not answering the phone when my mother calls I mean, you know it adds a layer of hotness.
What are you saying? That our hotness is only purely circumstantial.
And that if we were out in the real world, We'd like each other less? Mm.
You know that if we really started dating, after a few months, you'd realize that you hate the way that I laugh, I couldn't stand the way that you chew, And then we'd break up.
That's a very romantic story, you know, But It doesn't have to be like that.
Care to make a bet? I got an idea.
I will hole up with you for the next 24 hours, and we can fast-forward through the entire relationship.
Leave the seat up, sing Timberlake in the shower.
Ah, watch TV shows you really like As opposed to ones you're supposed to like? What do you say you, me, this apartment? Let's get sick of each other.
Okay.
As you can see, the restaurant would be elegant.
Seasonal menu, extensive wine list.
You know, the space is big, But I want it to have a more intimate feel.
And how would you be using the vault space? It's perfect for storage.
I have to be honest.
Give your reputation, when you made your bid, the board was very concerned.
I completely understand.
The neighbors don't want some raucous club coming in and disrupting the quiet.
And believe me, I wouldn't want to bring that element to the area.
I'll be right down.
Ok, I got it.
I got it.
Sorry.
I'm not here.
My heel broke.
Stepsister.
I apologize.
My lawyer.
Excuse me.
Sorry for interrupting your meeting.
Not at all.
We were just finishing up anyway.
Oh, are you are you leasing Chuck the bank space? Mm-hmm.
He has a real vision.
I know.
Turning the vault into a club, it's genius.
Serena.
Excuse me? Thank you.
Cool party.
I'm Amalia.
I'm glad people understand the concept of being fashionably late, But this is ridiculous.
I think everybody's Down the hall, watching a movie or something.
What? Please.
Ease up on the toro.
He has to answer to a board, Serena.
And board members tend not to approve of clubs with coat check girls who give happy endings.
It was an honest mistake.
When he was talking about your plans Look, why do you think I asked you to go out tonight? Because I knew something like this would happen.
Fine.
Then I'll go.
Train wreck.
Great job, Vanessa.
That was awesome.
Oh.
Hey, Blair.
Oh, my god.
We just finished watching Vanessa's documentary about this community garden in her neighborhood.
It was amazing.
No, it wasn't.
Yes, it was.
I I mean, Vanessa, tears.
Actual tears.
When that gang member picked up his first carrot okay, screening is over.
The cocktail party has officially begun in the common room.
Sake-tinis.
And is that my invitation being used as a coaster? Um, thanks so much, Blair, But we actually just scarfed, like, four pizzas, And Vanessa's about to show us Her bootleg Michel Gondry videos.
Georgina, please.
Nobody wants greasy pizza and Vanessa's home movies when there's a sushi and sake party right in the other room.
Did I mention wasabi facials? Okay, then.
And shut the door? Spotted Blair Waldorf going from V.
I.
P.
to V.
D.
Poor Blair.
How are you going to cure this one? Morning.
Hey.
Thanks for letting me crash here last night.
Harboring an ivy league fugitive? I'm your man.
I made you breakfast.
I have to go, but remember, we don't have any servants here, So if you see anybody else in the loft besides me, Call the police.
It's not the chef.
Good to know.
So did classes start already? Uh, no, just orientation stuff.
But, uh, i did join a literary group.
More people have talked to me at N.
Y.
U.
In one day Than my entire four years at St.
Jude's.
Well, i'm not surprised.
I can totally see why people would love you there.
Oh, about Brown Uh, you really should think about talking to my dad.
He might ramble a lot, he might nervously strum his guitar, But, uh, when it comes to fatherly advice, I don't know, he's pretty much the best there is.
Do you want one? - Thanks.
Come to the party.
Come to the party.
Thanks.
It's gonna be really fun.
We'll be there.
Oh, fantastic.
Oh.
So if you're not trying to sabotage me, then what is this? First you deliberately ruin my sushi party, And now you're making your move.
This paranoia has got to stop, Blair.
I am not paranoid.
I'm right.
Why else would you have formed an alliance with Vanessa, The one person I may hate more than you? It's not an alliance.
It's a friendship.
Unlike you, Vanessa's cool and people like her, More than the weird girl who threw the fish party.
Sushi.
There was toro.
Face it, Blair.
Once upon a time, in a far-off land, You were a queen.
Here you're just a loser who will never fit in.
So you won't be needing that.
Hey, guys.
Do you want to come to my party? - You can have one, too.
You're really pretty.
Thank you.
Rufus? Hello? What are you doing here? Rufus and I were just catching up.
But I have to prepare for a meeting tonight.
Thank you for the waffles.
Look, I I don't know what kind of twisted spin Chuck put on things, But I actually wanted to talk to you about this.
Rufus, I'm having doubts about going to Brown.
Well, I'm sorry about that, But to lie about leaving for college? I mean, between the show you put on for the paparazzI all summer And the craziness at the polo party last week and this, I don't know what's going on with you.
I know.
I'm sorry I lied.
I just didn't want to upset my mom.
Well, at least we agree about that, Which is why you can repack your things and go to Brown today.
I'll have a car here within an hour.
As long as you're in it, there's no reason - Lily ever has to know about this.
Or what, you'll tell on me? Wow.
I feel really emotionally supported - in making this life-changing decision.
It's not a decision.
It's a mistake, - which is why I'm--I'm trying to get you not to make it.
By threatening me.
Do you know you're more afraid of my mother than I am? You know what, Rufus? Go ahead.
Call her.
You can let her know I'm not going to Brown.
Thanks for the talk.
What do you want? Hey.
I was wondering if you want to go out tonight.
I thought you were at Brown.
No, I'm not.
In fact, after I hang up with you, I will be withdrawing my admission.
There's nobody I'd rather celebrate with.
So are you in or out? See you tonight.
No, I'm telling you, I learned everything I need to know about women From Judy Blume's "Forever.
" Can I talk to you? Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
What's up? I was wondering Do you have a date to Georgina's party? Forget the four horsemen.
The real evidence our world is coming to an end Blair Waldorf needing Dan Humphrey To rescue her from social extinction.
You OK? I just feel like I got off on the wrong foot here, And I want to start again.
So Thanks for bringing me,Humphrey.
Oh.
Uh,yeah.
Well,you know,I I would just like to think That if I needed it, somebody would do the same for me.
Although, let's be honest, we both know it wouldn't be you.
Oh.
No headbands in college,okay? * She was so shy * * Till I drove her wild * * I make them good girls go bad * * I make them good girls * - Katie.
Hey,guys.
Blair, you, uh, you remember Katie? Yeah.
Cute necklace.
Thank you.
I love your How how about I get us all drinks and you two talk? Just not about high school, please.
What's up, Dan? So was everyone at your high school Totally jealous of Dan for being such a great writer? Dan's a writer? She was so shy Till I drove her wild Oh.
Hey, Dan.
Hey.
Um,listen.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I I was out of line.
Please don't don't even worry about it.
I mean,you have every right to be upset.
I'm just really glad you're here.
Thanks.
Okay,so am I really drunk, Or did I just see you walk in with Blair? Look, you wanted me to give you a second chance.
Don't you think you should give one to Blair? She's not looking for a second chance.
She's looking for a way in.
People like you here, Dan, and Blair sees that.
I'm sorry.
I've been the person not welcome at parties, And if I'm now on the other side of things, I'm I'm not gonna treat people the way I was treated, - Even if it's Blair.
I'm just trying to look out for you.
Trust me.
You're being used.
Have fun.
* Oh * * Yeah * * Good girls go * Gross! With your mother's L.
L.
Bean catalog? Ugh.
A cargo short fetish Definitely goes in the "minus" column.
What are you talking about? I was, like, 12 years old.
Speaking of pants, pass yours over here.
What do you need my pants for? - Because I want to see what's in them.
Come on.
Show me all your secrets.
Have a look.
It's just normal stuff.
Normal stuff, huh? All right.
See? Hmm? Keys, cell phone.
A boarding pass From London.
Don't tell me that you've been wearing these pants since we met, because that really would be gross.
No, I If you must know, I kept it.
Ah.
And he has a sentimental streak.
Hey, I thought your theory was that If we really got to know each other, we'd break up.
Mm.
Maybe I'm revising my theory.
* You were a problem child.
* To you.
Brown's loss is my gain.
Thank you.
You know, when you called, I tried not to answer.
Great.
Chuck Bass.
Let's get out of here.
No.
Come on.
Since when do you run away from Chuck Bass ? It looks like he's having a business meeting.
This could be fun.
* You're a hot mess * No way.
Serena, Carter, this isn't a good time.
Well, then let's make it one.
What's wrong, Chuck? Aren't you happy to see us? - You know, Carter and I were Just sharing our favorite Chuck Bass stories.
There were so many we had to break them into categories.
What were we up to, international affairs? - Oh, there was a time when, uh, Chuck And the Italian Ambassador's son Were asked to leave an Amsterdam brothel.
Now that's an accomplishment.
Simple misunderstanding.
None of us spoke any Dutch.
Oh! My gosh.
Is this is this a business meeting? I'm I'm sorry if you sense any tension.
Those two don't like each other that much 'Cause they share the same taste in women.
Sometimes they share the actual women.
That's enough.
So what's this business meeting about, Bass? - Still trying to fill your daddy's shoes? - Yeah, Chuck, come on.
Tell him your idea.
I'm opening a restaurant.
Yeah, that's what he's telling people, But downstairs, in the vault, he's creating a club.
What did you say? You wanted to redefine decadence? You wanted to ruin my deal, So you came here and brought Carter Baizen as your wingman.
I told Rufus about Brown Because I was actually concerned for you.
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
Are you insane? "battlestar" kicks "T.
N.
G.
" ' ass.
What other show on the history of the planet Has been asked to speak at the U.
N.
? Oh, perfect.
An organization that condemns terrorism while secretly funding it hosts a panel for a show that glorifies terrorists.
Dude, I can't even look at you right now.
Fine.
Don't look.
What do you think? Trust me.
You don't want to know.
I do.
I do want to know.
Oh, thank God.
* Moving in an elliptical pattern * Man, I'm really glad you decided to come to the party.
Oh, thanks, man.
That's Vanessa cares about you a lot, And I know that she was hoping you'd come.
You know -Yeah, yeah, I know.
There he is.
Oh, speak of the devil.
Hey.
To, uh, to fresh starts.
I'm happy you're here, Humphrey.
Me, too.
So, Scott, you are in big trouble.
I cannot believe you told Vanessa to take professor Rifkin - For art in the world.
Why? I mean, I liked him.
Dude, he's totally old school, not to mention just plain old.
I mean, his lecture notes are literally turning yellow with age.
Please do tell.
What other professors are you recommending? Yeah, let's hear it, because katie's gonna have - To weigh in from now on.
I I'm at a party.
I really don't feel like taking a test right now.
Excuse me, everyone.
Can you please stop with that noise? - Hi, everyone.
What the hell? Well, most of you don't know me.
My name is Blair Waldorf.
But a lot of you know My roommate, who threw this amazing party Georgina.
Georgina! Yeah, I know.
Georgina rocks, right? I mean, it's funny, 'cause I never knew That a Jesus freak could throw such a good party, But I guess I was wrong.
So, everyone, raise a glass Or a Plastic cup of foam To the coolest christian I know Georgina Sparks.
What do you know, what do you know What do you know about Jesus? What do you know, what do you know What do you know about the lord? What do you know, what do you know about Jesus And his love? Oh My God.
This is a conversion party.
I can't believe it.
Georgina threw this party And invited all her friends here To convert the vulnerable freshmen.
It seems that Blair Waldorf has finally found Jesus And invited him to crash Georgina's party.
Carter, wait.
So that's the whole reason You wanted me to go out with you tonight You knew i'd help you screw over Chuck.
Chuck had screwed me over or or at least I thought he had.
I wanted to get him back.
Serena, listen to you.
What's your deal? You're acting out 'cause daddy doesn't love you? - Is that why you skipped out on Brown, too? - Please.
No.
I told you how I felt, and you blew me off Until you needed someone to do your dirty work.
It's time to find a new bad habit, 'Cause it's not gonna be me anymore.
V.
I.
P.
V.
I.
P.
Room at the Monkey Bar.
Monkey Bar.
Can't wait.
The limo's waiting downstairs.
We were worried about you.
We missed you so much.
I can't tell you how my heart filled with joy When we got your call inviting us to share his glory - With all of your new friends.
I didn't invite you here.
We thought our little lamb had been lost for good.
I am lost for good.
This isn't East Ridge High School prom.
Bye.
Hello.
Hey, uh, excuse me.
Could I get everyone's attention, please? Hey.
Hi.
Hello.
I'm Dan.
I just want to let everybody know here.
That, uh, Blair Waldorf over there invited some people from Georgina's past, just so she could embarrass her.
But you know, we'rewe're all starting college here, and college is supposed to be a place where you're not judged by what you believe oror the friends you make.
You're here to make new friends and start over, right? So last time I checked, I mean, I think - I think thisthis party's pretty fun.
Yeah? - Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
So Who wants to leave with Blair? All right, and who wants to stay here and drink cheap beer with me? It's a no-brainer.
* She was so shy till I drove* Thank you.
You didn't have to do that.
Yeah, I did.
* I make them good girls go bad * Let's get a beer.
* I make them good girls go bad * Uhoh, B.
Looks like your new flock was just led astray, and by Dan Humphrey no less.
I guess they know a force profit when they see it.
Hi.
You mind if I join you? - It's your home.
Dan told you I was here? I was glad you felt like you could come here, that you felt like this was a safe place.
I'm really sorry, Rufus.
I never meant for it to get this messed up.
None of it was your fault.
Well, I didn't help matters.
I shouldn't have blown up at you the way that I did.
So Talk to me.
Well, um I called Brown and deferred for a year.
Okay.
It may have been for the wrong reasons at the time, II think.
Well, no, II know that it was the right decision.
I would have just been going because my mom wanted me to go, and while that's a good reason, that's not good enough.
You know, I did the same thing.
Well,it was Rutgers, not Brown, but I got in and I realized that if I didn't pursue music, I'd never do it.
I wish I had that same sense of purpose.
But I hope that if Iif I take this time, that I'll find it.
Gosh.
How am I gonna tell my mom? Maybe I could help you figure that out.
I know I'm not the first guy that your mom's brought into your life, But if you and Eric will let me, I'd really like to be more to you than than just Lily's most recent husband.
Let me help you with this.
Wow.
I, uh I would really appreciate that, Rufus.
I'm sorry, mom.
It wasn't my intention to embarrass you or daddy.
Look, I wouldn't be doing any of this, if I didn't feel the way that I do.
I really, really like him, and Mom, please.
Don't be like that.
Mom? I guess we didn't fool the doorman.
So you told your mom the truth? I didn't want to risk everything with my family for some fling that wasn't gonna last.
But? Well, if your family can accept us together, maybe one day mine will, too.
And if not? It's a risk that I'm willing to take.
There's a reason we never went downtown It's awful.
The minute you cross 14th street, people forget there's a class system.
B, you will find your place.
Just give it time.
No, I found my place, and it's at the bottom.
It's a point of pride now that I see who's on top.
Anyway, it's all turned out for the best.
If I hadn't been so distracted, I would've been able to force you to go to Brown.
That's sweet, but no, you wouldn't have.
I am sorry I pulled a disappearing act on you.
I'm sure you'll find a way to make it up to me In the handbag department at Bendel's.
Now normally I'd be more worried about Brown, but you actually seem a lot better than you have in a while.
I really am.
It was so much easier when it was just about where we sat on the met steps.
Yeah, but we've We've been here, done this.
But I was so good at it.
Well Then it's time for a new challenge For both of us.
I'm glad you're not going to Brown.
I need you here.
Same.
Mm.
Bye.
Bye, you.
I'm sorry I'm late, but I have a good excuse.
What is this? A review of all the professors I had this summer.
And look, I even gave them grades.
Wow.
This is amazing.
I'm sorry For that weird moment with Katie last night.
I think I got a little, um, overwhelmed from meeting all your friends.
That's okay.
That was kind of the least weird part of the whole night.
Yeah, when Dan He got on the mike and he convinced everyone to stay at the party, that was insane.
Is he usually like that? No.
Dan is more of a corner-of-the-party guy.
Should I call him, see if he'll join us? Call him later.
I just want to be with you right now.
What do you want, Serena? There's a reason I always come back to you, Carter.
And it's not because you're my bad habit.
What then? You're the only one who understood why I needed to find my father.
You were there for me during all of that, and I trust you.
Anyone would have done the same thing.
No, they wouldn't have.
And I don't want anyone else.
I want you.
Mm.
You were right about the dorms.
The lighting is awful.
Are you okay? Mm.
I am now.
* We are all embers through all of the devilish things we do * * From the same fire through all of the devilish things we do * * We are all embers through all of the devilish things we do * * From the same fire through all of the devilish things we do * Hello? Hey.
Do you want to meet me and Scott so we can download about the epicness last night? Mm.
No, you know, I'm still a little wrecked.
So, uh, I'll I'll call you later.
Okay.
Bye.
* We are all embers from the same fire.
We are all embers * Apparently, higher education doesn't make for smarter decisions.
So take out your notebooks and sharpen your pencils, kids.
Gossip girl's going to college, and this class has a lot to learn.
Morning in New York time to wake up from bad dreams, roll out of the beds we've made and start making plans for a brighter future.
Chuck, it's me.
I know this sounds a little schedule-y, But with you focused on making your mark in the business world and me focused on Point being, I just got out of my first class, and I was thinking if I skipped French history, we might have enough time to squeeze in a mid-morning renaissance before lunch.
Aah! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! God, No! Ugh! I'm wearing a glove, and I still want to wash my hands! Hey, roomie.
Dan was just I was I was just I was getting a book that I needed.

  It's, um, "our bodies, ourselves
a new edition for a new era.
" That's excellent.
No, I know what this is, and don't think that you can run me out of my own room with a half-naked Dan Humphrey.
Fine.
Stay.
maybe you'll learn something.
No, that's okay.
I was just about to hit the trail, you know? It just so happens I'm on my way to a very important breakfast.
I just stopped by to drop off my books and pick up my mail.
So feel free to hit the trail all you want.
From Serena to Georgina? Quite a fall, even for you.
Don't worry about Blair.
I knew she'd have a problem with us.
But I think Vanessa's gonna be supportive and Serena and Jenny, your dad.
Hey.
I'm starved.
Want to grab breakfast? Um, you know what? I I gotta be somewhere, but, uh, rain check? Sure.
no biggie.
Thanks.
Dan? What? Oh, of course.
Did I just catch you on a walk of shame? No.
no.
no, don't be silly.
I was visiting, uh, uh, Vanessa.
She's on this new Chinese feng shui kick, and she makes you take your shoes off when you And your shirt? Yeah, it's weird.
I thought I heard your voices.
What's going on? I was looking for Blair's room, and Dan here claims he was visiting you.
But if that's Vanessa's room, then where Please tell me was Blair and not Georgina.
Please tell me it was Georgina and not Blair.
I don't want to talk about this right now, in the hallway Or ever.
Never would also be good.
I would like that.
I I just mean that when you do something no one knows about, it's kind of like you're not really doing it.
But when someone finds out about it It becomes real.
Yeah.
Well, college is time for experimentation, psychedelic drugs, ethnic food Girls who once pretended to be "Sarah" from Portland.
Okay, so so, uh, you guys are what? We're just going to tease you mercilessly.
But without judgment, 'cause who doesn't have a Georgina in their closet, right? right.
Right.
Okay.
I was coming to see Blair, but now that she's not here, uh, You want to button up and come with me, tiger? I'll come with you.
Scott has his comp theory seminar in the mornings, and, um, I'm gonna try to catch him for coffee.
Oh, I thought the, uh, comp theory seminar was in the afternoon.
Georgina's friend just kept talking about how hard it was to get in.
I completely forgot how much reading I have to do before class, so I'm I'm just gonna catch up with you guys later.
Okay.
Vanessa, hey.
Hey.
How was, um, comp theory? Nonstop excitement.
Lots of theories.
Yeah, I just ran into Dan, and he thought the seminars were in the afternoons or something.
Yeah, the seminars are, but the study groups are in the mornings.
Then why don't I swing by your study group, and we can grab coffee? I'd love to.
It's just, um, I can't.
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
I'll call you later.
Yeah.
Bye.
Vanessa says hi.
Did you tell her you were a natural? One week of guitar lessons, you got all the major chords.
Thanks again.
And I've always wanted to learn.
I just figured I'd take a shot at getting a few pointers from one of the greats.
Well, I don't know about one of the "greats.
" Maybe one of the "pretty goods.
" All right.
Here we go.
Actually been meaning to talk to you about something.
Me, too.
You know, Vanessa's like a daughter to me, and not to slip into after-school special territory, but I just wanted to, uh, make sure Don't worry.
Vanessa I like her a lot.
I do.
It's just, um, I hope everything works out.
Why wouldn't it? Hey, Scott.
Dad, uh, you excited about the auction tonight? Uh, Lily has a photo for sale at the charity auction at Sotheby's.
I'm gonna go and check out.
Oh, wow.
'72 Bowie is a dead ringer for Shakira.
You know, I I should, um, I should probably take off.
But I thought you wanted to talk.
It, it can wait.
Maybe next time we jam.
Is Wednesday still good? See you then.
All right.
Dad, Scott's been spending a lot of time here lately.
Yeah, he's a good kid.
Good guitar player, too.
So you're being pretty open-minded about this Georgina thing.
Well, maybe it's because since I started dating Carter, I have never been more pleasantly surprised.
Oh, so you're you're now dating Carter Baizen? Is it because Chuck isn't currently available? He's not like Chuck anymore, which is why I'm saying, if you want to date Georgina, then more power to you.
I would just check to make sure there's not an ice pick under the bed.
We're not dating.
We are, uh, we're just we're hanging out.
Then piece of advice? You should make sure she knows that.
'Cause if Georgina likes somebody, she will go from zero to crazy before you know it.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You, too.
Hey.
Why are we meeting downtown? What's the big surprise? I've been staying at the downing.
What do you say to a weekend of room service and white fluffy robes? Can you afford a hotel? I thought your parents cut you off.
When there's a white fluffy robe, there's a way.
Unless you have plans tonight.
Well, not me, but maybe we? There's this family thing tonight.
It's an auction, but I thought may Carter? Aubrey.
We met at Brandy Library last month.
You have no idea who I am, do you? No, but probably because I wasn't at the Brandy Library last month.
Oh, okay.
So I guess I had s*x with another Carter Baizen who drinks is single malt with one ice cube and claimed to be leaving with the Peace Corps the next day.
Sounds like a charming fellow.
Mistaken identity? Obviously.
You know I take my scotch neat.
I have no idea who that woman is, Serena.
That's hey, that that's not me anymore.
Okay.
What about tonight? You were gonna ask me something? Uh, you know what? It was it was nothing.
I I'll I'll call you later.
Scott Adler I just need to know if he's in comp theory.
I'm sorry, but we're not allowed to give out students' class schedules.
When faced with an uncertain future, the questions we truly hate to ask are the ones we fear we already know the answer to.
What if he's not a student? I don't need his schedule.
I just need to know that he actually goes here.
Please.
My last boyfriend told me his dad invented the battery.
I'm sorry.
There's no record of a Scott Adler in the system.
I recommend the hot apple cider caramel.
On what? Surprise me.
Mmm.
You are amazing.
But look, I, uh, I have a really big meeting in a few hours.
A few hours is hours from now.
Seriously.
It's important.
I have to keep my focus.
It with Sean MacPherson.
I'm only gonna get one shot with him.
As opposed to me, who's just Look, I'll make it up to you.
Where are you going? No idea.
I officially have nowhere left to go.
My roommate is a nympho with a sock-fetish, I have no friends at school, and now my boyfriend would rather obsess about a restaurateur than spend quality time with me and hasn't, by the way, in five days.
In biblical times, destiny was delivered in the form of stone tablets or a burning bush.
But today, true destiny is often engraved and carries an embossed seal.
Oh my God.
Serena? You won't believe what I just got.
I got that.
Hi.
Hey.
How's it going? Hey.
Oh, Hey.
What are you doing here? I was just, uh, I I I wanted to talk to you about us.
No not us us.
It's, uh, look, here's the thing.
But I just want to make sure we're on the same page about us, uh, hanging out like we do.
If you want me to leave, I can understand.
Uh That was your first of those talks, huh? Yeah.
How was I? Yore adorable.
Come on.
I was heading out for pizza.
Don't worry.
No strings.
Yeah, ay.
Yeah, yeah.
I like I like pizza.
That was easy.
Le Table Elitaire? The Elite Table.
How have you not heard of them? It's a secret society.
If I had heard of it, it wouldn't be a secret.
They're modeled after the grandes coles in France.
Secret salons for the elite of academic institutions.
Finally something exclusive to strive for, something worthy of all my pent-up energy and attention.
So I take it you and Chuck still have No, and if he wants to focus on something other than us, so can I.
You know, in a way, I blame all this on you.
Me? Yes.
Well, he told me about how you killed his speakeasy plan last week, and hanging out with Carter Baizen L listen to me.
S.
Listen very carefully.
You're not going to brown.
you're scared to tell your mom.
You're in free fall.
Enter Carter Baizen.
I get it.
Believe me.
But you need to pull this chute before splat! No, it's it's not like that.
He's different with me.
He actually knows me.
And who are you trying to convince me or you? Carter, I wanted to invite you to the Sotheby's auction with me tonight.
Call me back and let me know that you can come.
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
Guys like Carter don't change, S.
Ooh! It's them.
Who? Le Table Elitaire.
They've given me my initiation instructions.
This is it.
I gotta go.
Oh, and you really are making a huge mistake.
Bye! Chuck Bass for Mr.
MacPherson.
I apologize, but he's going to have to reschedule.
It's Devyn, right? We spoke earlier.
You're, uh, far more beautiful than I pictured.
I have a M.
B.
.
A from Tuck.
I'm not the coat check girl.
Well, then I'm sure you're aware his club on 63rd isn't doing as well as it could.
Uptown isn't downtown.
I have some ideas he should hear get dozens of young guys a week pitching Sean their vision of the future.
That doesn't mean he wants to hear it.
I can be very persuasive.
So were they.
Piece of advice? You really want him to take you seriously? Find a way to show him that you respect his point.
At least then you'll have a shot.
I just can't believe your parents still haven't returned your phone calls.
Or e-mails or texts.
I even wrote on my dad's facebook wall.
What do you want to do tonight? Well, as much as I enjoy the low profile thing, it'be nice to at least go somewhere that has a cash register, maybe.
You mean actually go out together, be seen by other people? Well, yeah.
I would like you to meet some of my friends.
If they remember who you are.
I held you captive for quite a while.
Ah, but not against my will.
All right.
Let me see what everyone's doing tonight.
We'll make our public debut.
If your family finds out and doesn't like it Maybe they'll call and complain.
Oh.
Chuck? How did you know I was here? Did you find me to apologize? That is so sweet.
Not exactly, though I am sorry.
I know I've been all work lately.
If you didn't find me, what are you doing here? There's a photograph I need that's up for auction tonight.
Me, too.
My prayers have been answered.
A secret collegiate society wants me.
Initiation is easy.
All you have to do is contribute to their salon's art collection as a fee, so You've got to be kidding me.
I'm more of a Helmut Newton girl myself, but they want vintage McMullan.
Who am I to argue? You see the guy in this photo? That's Sean MacPherson.
He has an entire wall with photos like this in his office.
Look, procuring this one for him is the best way I can show him I have respect for his history.
Show him respect? He's a club owner, not a mafia don.
Look, you can buy your "table" people a wonderful Henry Diltz.
Le Table Elitaire.
I only have until midnight tonight.
This is what they asked for.
Look, I'm sorry, but I need this.
Well, you're not getting it or anything else, I might add.
I got your message.
What's up? I like you I like you, too.
That's why I'm gonna give you why there's no Scott Adler enrolled at N.
Y.
U.
Look, Vanessa, it's complicated.
Let me make it easy for you.
You either tell me the truth, or we're over.
I lied to you because I had to.
That's not good enough.
They say honesty is the best policy My name is my name isn't Adler.
It's Rosson.
I'm Rufus and Lily's son.
Oh, my God.
I hope everyone's policies are paid up, because it looks like we're on a collision course.
My parents told me I was adopted in middle school, but it wasn't until this past spring that I decided to find my biological parents.
And when I told my folks of my intentions, they said that they'd ready spoken with them, and they wanted nothing to do with me.
They lied to you, Scott.
Rufus and Lily went looking for you, and your parents said that you were dead.
Wait.
What? Yeah.
They said you were killed in a boating accident.
That was my younger brother Andrew.
Why would my parents tell them that? I don't know, but you need to tell Rufus who you are.
I need to talk to my parents first.
It's been 20 years.
What's a day or two more? If you have any feelings for me, you won't say anything yet.
The card's good, man.
Run it again.
I have, man, three times.
I've been instructed to destroy it and to call the authorities.
Wait.
Just just wait.
How much for the weekend? Including your room service bill? I didn't order any of this.
Are you kidding? I'm not paying for this.
Hey.
Hey, what's going on? Four-star hotels aren't what they used to be.
That's what.
Hey.
Hey, if you need to use my card, you can.
You should at least pay for room service.
I didn't order room service.
Carter.
You don't believe me.
You didn't with that woman this morning, and you don't now.
I believe you.
I do.
You'd make a terrible poker player.
I want to believe you've changed.
You're just making it hard for me.
If you don't trust me, then what are we doing? I'm not sure.
I came to apologize.
So apologize.
That was it.
But it comes with a bottle of champagne your favorite vintage, if I'm not mistaken.
Look, our relationship should be more important than business deals or secret societies.
So what do you propose? I propose we don't go to the auction tonight.
Neither one of us gets the photograph.
It's the only way.
Mm.
Pity.
I already have my bidding paddle.
Well I'm sure we can find some other use for it.
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for meeting me.
Sorry I sounded so cryptic on the phone.
No, no.
Don't worry about it.
I was having lunch with Georgina a couple blocks away so what's up? Scott's been lying to everyone.
What? What what do you mean? About what? He's not a student here.
Wait.
He's been lying about going to N.
Y.
U.
? Why why would anyone do that? Have you confronted him? Vanessa, come on.
He's been pretending to take classes, been recommending professors to you that is beyond creepy.
You gotta tell me what's going on.
Hey.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but Blair actually locked me out, and by the size of the sock on the doorknob, I didn't want to knock.
Okay, well, I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee and let you guys continue to stare at each other.
No, I'm I'm I'm leaving.
Vanessa, wait.
Are are you gonna come to the auction tonight, cause my dad wants us all to be there? We can talk then.
Right.
Rufus.
Yeah, I'll I'll definitely be there.
I'm a good listener.
Her boyfriend is apparently lying about going to school here, and she won't tell me why.
Well, she obviously likes the guy and wants to wish for the best.
I mean, it's not exactly unprecedented in affairs of the heart.
So I let it go, do nothing? No, silly.
We find out who this guy really is.
Mmm.
Oh.
Buckman.
Car detailed.
Dorota.
Dry cleaning.
We've been waiting a week for this.
I'm turning them off.
W wait.
"Got word photo could go for $5,500"? How could you? Hey.
Gi "The last McMullan went for $3,000"? I guess Dorota's counterintelligence isn't what it used to be.
Don't change the subject.
I can't believe you lied to me! Trying to use s*x to distract me.
I learned from the best.
That photograph is mine.
She stole my shoes.
Is there anything else that he told you? I I don't know.
He said he played soccer in high school, claimed he was M.
V.
P.
Soccer.
Is there a team name or a mascot? Uh, yeah, uh, Lions.
Wow.
okay.
I don't know how I remember that.
Voila.
Well, at least he was honest about sports.
Typical.
His last name's not Adler.
It's it's Rosson.
Does that mean anything to you? I figured you'd probably be halfway back to Boston by now.
Oh, I thought about it.
And? I thought about you.
I called my parents.
I had it out with them.
I told them what I needed to do, and they didn't take it very well.
I was just hoping that I wouldn't have to go through telling Rufus alone.
You don't.
Scott Rosson he wrote me that after reading my short story in "the New Yorker.
" That letter? So he's kinda like your stalker? I guess.
How rock star is that? Hey, Vanessa.
Uh, it's it's it's me.
Look, Scott is not who he says.
And I don't know.
He he could be dangerous.
Um, please call me.
So what now? She said she was going to the auction.
Do you have plans tonight? No.
Turns out photographs won't be the only thing up for grabs tonight.
a priceless secret is on the auction block and bidding begins now.
You ready? Look at me.
You can do this.
okay? Come on.
B.
, what are you doing here? I need a photograph that's up for auction tonight to get into Le Table Elitaire, but Chuck wants it for some business deal.
Can you believe that? Putting his own happiness above mine? What kind boyfriend does that? How is that a healthy relationship? Tell me! I take it you two still haven't There aren't enough curse words in the world to satisfy me right now.
I'm sorry.
If it makes you feel any better, you were right about Carter.
I should have listened to you.
It's for the best, S.
Most guys just are who they are.
Hey.
My Bottegas where are they? Consider them prisoners war.
They'll be released when I have the photograph.
And don't think you can distract me with another ounce of Dom.
So I see you're not with your, uh, sidekick this evening.
It's probably best.
This place doesn't accept I.
O.
U.
S.
Some guys just are Who they are? That's exactly what Blair just said.
I'm right here, okay? Hey! I didn't think you guys were coming.
Remember when I told you there was something I wanted to talk to you about today? That's why I'm here.
Ladies and gentlemen, the auction will begin in a few minutes.
Sorry.
Could you give me one second? I need to double-check when Lily's photo's up.
I'll be right back.
Oh, my God.
Don't worry.
It's it's a long night.
There's still time.
No, it's not that.
Who is she? That's my mother.

It's not destiny if you have to barter your way in.
You're special enough on your own.
You don't need some group to say you are.
And what about you? Since when does Chuck Bass pay for a partner? The Chuck I knew bribed no one but me.
Sold.
$7,500 to 9-1-5.
Thank you very much.
What?! What?! What are you doing here? Is is dad here, too? No.
After your phone call, I got in the car.
I came straight to New York.
I had Lily's address.
The doorman told me about the auction.
You know, if you came here to stop me, you wasted a trip.
I'm not here to stop you.
I'm here to stand by you.
When they came looking for you so soon after Andrew, the thought of losing you, too I told your father to lie.
It's my fault.
And that's why I'm here tonight, to tell you You're my son.
Sweetie I love you.
And if this is what you need to do, then we support you.
This is my kind of date.
Racing to an art auction to confront a possible stalker? What, was your last boyfriend Batman? Admit it.
You're having fun.
Dad.
Thank God.
Hey, we need to find Vanessa and Scott.
I was just with them.
Why? Scott is.
We think he could be Dan's stalker.
Hi.
Georgina Sparks.
Yeah, you may remember me as as Sarah, but, um, it's nice to see you again, sir.
Do you remember my fan letter from last year? That was him.
He's been using a different last name.
He's been lying about going to school, and he's been befriending all of us.
Yeah.
No, he could be dangerous.
Dangerous? He's not.
He just wants to talk to you.
Talk to me about what? He'll explain everything.
Scott, uh, what's going on? I haven't told you the truth.
My last name is Rosson.
This is my mom.
I'm your son's brother, Andrew's brother, and I, uh, just really wanted to meet you.
Sorry, Vanessa.
Looks like the price of truth was just too rich for Scott's blood.
S.
, what are you doing? What are you guys doing sabotaging Carter? his hotel room service bill one of your favorites, if I recall.
So we started a stealth campaign to destroy his credibility.
Room service bill, the girl on the street.
The warrant.
What warrant? Well, he might want to take a D.
N.
A.
sample down to the 24th precinct tomorrow the point is I did it to protect you.
Me? Just hate the guy.
All Carter cares about is himself.
When we ran him out of town six months ago, he traded his Dubai ticket for Greece.
Greece? Spent the next few months checking in and out of every resort and hotel from there to Fiji.
He only came back because he was broke.
He went looking for him.
Who? My father.
I found out he was getting remarried, two years ago, in Santorini.
Finally.
What happened in Santorini? I wanted to see him, but I didn't want anyone to know, when the police picked us up on the way to the wedding, I realized "access" meant stolen.
Carter promised he'd make it up to me.
I had no idea he's been looking for my father himself.
And did he find him? You know, I have to go.
Fine.
I'll call my guy at the precinct.
I don't understand why you didn't just tell us who you were.
I wasn't even sure you would talk to me.
I wasn't even sure what I would say if you did.
Hey, let's just, uh, let's go back to the house, you and your mom, and we'll we'll get to know each other better.
No, I'd like that, it's just in time.
For now, I think this is a good first step.
You got you got a great family, Mr.
Humphrey, and my brother would have been proud to know you, all of you.
Thanks, Scott.
You don't know how much that means to me.
I'm sorry, S.
But it's still Carter.
Are you sure it's worth the risk? I don't know.
You tell me.
You and Chuck are two of the most self-centered, damaged people I know.
I'm not following.
Well, somehow two wrongs make a twisted right.
You don't think it was worth the risk? Here.
You know what to do with this.
Damn him.
You've got to be kidding me.
I want you to have this.
Why? Because I love you, you enormously stubborn pain in the ass.
And what about Le Table Elitaire? What about them? I believe in you.
And if this is what it takes for you to believe in you, then it's worth it.
In a bidding war, even when you win, what you thought you wanted can suddenly be reappraised Does Le Table Elitaire even exist, Georgina? I'm sorry, but my French is a little rusty.
Maybe you should start with "excusez-moi.
" You know, I should have recognized your "G" when Blair first showed me the invitation.
It has caused me enough trouble in the past.
Well, Le Table Elitaire does exist.
My friend Devyn was a member in Dartmouth.
Although I doubt the N.
Y.
U.
chapter has ever heard of Blair Waldorf If there even is an N.
Y.
U.
chapter.
Oh, good.
So you haven't changed at all.
What about Dan? Dan is Dan.
But when it comes to Blair Waldorf, I don't have to do much but sit back, lit a match and watch her go up in flames.
Well, if you keep pushing her, she will push back, and when she does, I will be right behind her.
Now we've had enough of you tonight.
Other times, old opponents resurface to raise the stakes I thought after the night we've had, we'd hit Morondi's some lemon spaghetti, some fried artichokes.
Did someone say food? I'm starving.
Let me just find Georgina.
Oh, you know what? Don't bother.
Um, she already left.
She said she had a headache or something.
What? Oh, okay.
It's kind of weird she didn't say goodbye.
I should I'll call her.
Tomorrow.
We'll talk first.
How about it, Vanessa? You hungry? But it's the things we walk away from that feel like they cost the most.
Let's go.
And yet, it's when we've been outbid, forced to watch our prize go home with others, that the rules of protocol no longer apply.
I wouldn't put your paddles away just yet.
Who knows what bidders will do when they're desperate? Hey.
Glad you called.
Do you want to do something today? Oh, you know, I can't.
Oh.
Serena told you about Blair and Chuck.
Yeah.
Yeah, she did.
Look, I I sent that invitation out last week, before you and I got together.
But it's Blair and Chuck.
I mean, talk about a victimless crime.
Yeah, I yeah, I know.
.
but I really think we should cool things off for a while, you know, take a take a little break? A break? Already? Well, we did say no strings.
Right.
No strings.
I'll see you later.
Okay.
Sorry.
I thought you should know that she hadn't changed.
No, you you did the right thing to tell me.
And speaking of, uh, change Yeah, I left Carter, like, a dozen messages.
He doesn't want anything to do with me.
I I highly doubt that.
You're a pretty tough one to shake.
Well, maybe if I didn't believe in him he is right to shake me.
You know, I think my dad is attempting crepes.
We might want to check the smoke alarms.
Good plan.
So how'd it work? You happen to mention your meeting to Georgina, and she hatched up a plan to cause trouble between me and my girlfriend? Georgie and I go back.
The girl has an M.
B.
A.
in deviant behavior.
And you're going to need a better sense of humor in the club business.
Nice photo.
Thanks.
Chuck Bass.
Big fan.
By the way, when your lease at the Empire Hotel isn't renewed, thank bright eyes here.
Thanks for seeing me.
I wanted to say goodbye before I left for Boston.
Don't thank me yet.
You can't ask me to keep this secret.
Rufus and Lily gave me up.
Now that was their choice.
I don't blame them for that, but I think that this time, this choice should be mine.
Promise me that you'll come back one day and tell them.
I can't do that.
I'm really glad you came.
What do you want, Serena? It was Chuck and Blair the girl on the street, your room service, your credit card.
Yeah, I sorta put that together yesterday.
You did? When it comes to an eye for an eye, Chuck's a man of the cloth.
Plus, having spent so much time with Blair, the '95 Dom was kind of a tell.
So why didn't you say anything? I did.
I told you it wasn't me.
I'm no saint, Serena.
If you're looking for the first excuse to bolt, trust me, you're gonna find one.
For my sake, I figured sooner was better than later.
I'm not looking for an excuse anymore.
Who says the offer's still on the table? Now who'd make a terrible poker player? Come on.
Will you eat breakfast with my family? Hey.
We're gonna need an extra seat.
Hi.
How you doing? Ah, fresh crepes.
You said you wanted to talk.
Why here? I just came from Sean MacPherson's office.
I wanted to thank his assistant.
She did me a favor.
I was thinking too small.
Why settle for some club in a hotel when you can just buy the hotel? Chuck a club is one thing, but a hotel? I've been meeting with the board of Bass Industries all morning.
I told them I want to cash my shares out Risk it all, on my own.
They think I've lost my mind.
Have you? No.
Then how can you be so sure? Because you believe in me.
Now I booked the penthouse for us.
What do you say we christen my legacy? Or do you need to be bribed? Bye.
Carter Baizen.
Bree Buckley.
Heard through the grapevine you were back in New York and dating Serena Van Der Woodsen, no less.
What do you want? Are you kidding? I'm headed home to face the family firing squad.
Considering what you did to us, being able to find you is gonna go a long way in getting me back in.
I'm sure they'll be in touch.
Oh, and, um, go ahead and run, if you want.
You know how much daddy loves to hunt.
Yes.
When's the next train to Boston? Thanks.
Anyone want to start the bidding on what happens next? Going once, going twice.

Young lady, i said we are the masters of the universe-- A society dedicated to promulgating the philosophical And political messages contained In the 1981 to '83 cartoon featuring he-man.

It just takes time.
At least i know constance hasn't changed.
Oh! Eric, constance is gonna be so different.
There's no more hierarchy, no more mean girls, No one copying how the queen dresses.
It's gonna be a new era of sunlight and fairness.
Yeah, i don't think that's what blair had in mind When she picked you to be her successor.

Now.
(scoffs) So A new era of sunlight and fairness? Shut up.
(giggles) That is absolutely unacceptable.
Okay.
uh, no, i'm sorry.
My mom would never hit the table like that.
She--she would put her fingers to her forehead and do that, Like, "why are you doing this to me?" thing.
Oh, right.
i know it.
this Yeah, perfect.
so again.
Okay, um (clears throat) Mom, i have decided not to go to brown.
(sighs) oh, serena.
I Please know that i've put a lot of thought into this.
What is it? i'm sorry.
she--she would just only do--do the forehead thing For a second, then she would look to the side And do these little head shakes, you know? uh, serena, i appreciate your pointers, But the purpose of this role-playing is to get you ready To tell your mom about brown.
No, i know.
i know.
i-i'm just-- I'm really nervous about her coming back tomorrow, And--and when are you gonna tell her about the whole scott drama? Uh, a-after she digests the fact That her daughter's not going to college.
That's a lot to hit her with right away.
(sighs) Now one more time.
mom.
Yes, dear.
You're here.
(gasps) serena.
Lily.
(laughs) Ohh.
oh, rufus! Oh, my gosh.
mmm.
It is so good to see you both.
You didn't tell us you were coming.
(laughs) well, cece's feeling so much better, So i thought i would surprise you.
(laughs) (sighs) Serena, what are you doing here? shouldn't you be at brown? So i've been reading the course catalog, And everything just sounds so interesting, Like cold war philosophy and the bible as literature, The post-impressionist movement.
I want to take everything.
And you say you're from jersey? (laughs) seriously, i had to convince a lot of people To let me come here.
I'm determined to take advantage of it.
(cell phone alert dings) Well, you know what? on behalf of everyone at n.
y.
u.
, All of 'em--welcome.
my stuff just got here.
i gotta go move in.
Okay, well, how am i gonna pay you back for this? Call it my treat.
it was really nice to meet you, dan.
It was nice meeting you, kate.
I know how much you want me to go, But this is the right thing.
I was against it at first, but i think there are benefits To serena deferring a year.
and i'm gonna do something productive while i'm here-- Get a job or--or an internship.
Mom, say something.
Well, serena, if this is just a case of cold feet, fine.
I mean, classes have barely begun.
It's not about cold feet.
I'm just not ready.
i don't know who i am.
But that's why people go to college--to figure it out.
Wasn't that the point of this summer? You were going to europe to find yourself? Well, i didn't find What i was looking for.
Well, unless your real self is waiting for you at antik, I don't see the point in another year of gallivanting Around new york.
i told you, i'm going to work.
(sighs) i love you, serena, But you have never worked a day in your life.
Look, why don't you give college a try? If it takes me getting a job For you to believe that i'm serious, then i'll do it.
but for now, i am not going to college.
(sighs) i'm sorry, lil.
i debated calling you.
Oh.
It's okay, honey.
i understand.
You knew i was with my mother, And you didn't want to burden me.
But make no mistake.
i am back, and she is going to brown.
All right, i'm gonna unpack.
There is no more hierarchy.
The steps of the met will no longer be restricted To a certain crowd.
No more nair-tinis.
no more headbands.
This is a new era.
Let freedom reign.
well, well.
word is that change is in the air (beeping) at constance billard.
the madness and genius of skeletor.
That is correct.
i said "genius.
" i have to wonder (beep) when queen b.
finds out how little j.
is treating her legacy will she let it slide? Oh, thank god.
By the way, sandals are not shoes.
Uh, no, she's not here yet, but the room looks great.
She should be here any second.
Um, hello? excuse me? Oh, i gotta go.

This is for you.
i've given one to all the girls in the hall.
Hold on.
what is all this stuff, And--and who is my roommate? (knock on door) and still no word from our reclusive starlet, but i have a feeling Uh, that'd be me.
Oh, my god.
we're in for a blockbuster.
I'm so sorry.
i had no idea that my publicist Was doing all this stuff.
And for the record, i love godard.
i'm just trying to wrap my head Around the fact that my roommate is (laughs) olivia burke.
And mine's Vanessa abrams.
Just two girls going to n.
y.
u.
It's crazy, right? Yeah.
Is that a confidentiality waiver? K.
c.

I cannot believe her.
Excuse me.
Thank you so much for seeing me on short notice.
You came highly recommended by anna wintour.
I was happy to make the time.

Um, i-i grew up on the upper east side.
I, um, i've always been interested in fashion and art.
I graduated from constance billard This past june.
I was supposed to start brown a few weeks ago, But then i realized i wasn't ready.
So you come here? Fashion isn't fallback college, you know.
No, i know.
yeah, i-i understand that.
We're thrilled you're serious about this.
Yeah, you know, i want more life experience, And with the work you're doing with a.
p.
f i find so interesting.
I will work for nothing.
it can be like an internship.
So do you think that you have anything? (art brut's "summer job" playing) No, nothing.
they all want me to come to their parties, But none of them want me to actually work for them.
No, i'm taking myself to lunch at hundred acres.
Why do you sound so happy? What do you mean, you had to quell a revolution? Blair, i gotta go.
i'll call you later.
Why are you not listening to me? I am not asking the girls in my hall To sign confidentiality waivers.
They already hate me enough.
they don't hate you, at least not after i sent them all Invites to your premiere tomorrow.
You really don't get it.
I told you that i wanted to have a normal college experience.
But, honey, this is your moment, okay? I mean, this movie is--is good-bye teenage vampires And hello, oscar.
(sighs) All right, i'm backing off.
You know, you have "larry king" tonight.
(camera shutters clicking) Oh, great.
did you call them? Olivia, calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down.
Why do you always do this? ex-excuse me? What? I'm sorry.
that was really rude.
Uh, yes, hi.
Don't worry about it.
um, just go through the kitchen, Make a left at the freezer and then a right.
It'll put you out on sullivan.
They were following me around for a while, So i learned the back exits everywhere.
Wow.

Everyone does not get a voice, and that's okay.
What is this? did you not hear me this morning? Oh, you mean your cute little attempt at perestroika? we're going back to the old way-- Queens, hierarchy and no brooklyn wannabes.
Sorry, little j.

Your background experience with the press-- I think you are just what she needs.
i appreciate your confidence.
Thank me later.
(woman) you are clueless! this is too blue! This is too pink! this is too red! K.
c.
, this is the most important night of my life, And you have me surrounded by amateurs? And color-blind amateurs with hidden agendas? You know that nobody supports me.
(whispers) everybody wants to see me fail.
Ursula, i want you to meet serena van der woodsen.
poor s.
no one told her this was going to be a horror movie.
You must have thought i was crazy.
No, i didn't think you were crazy.
oh, please.
You know you were like, "let me get this crazy lady to a party.
" (laughs) and thank god you did, because i've been cooped up here All day long.
okay, maybe a little crazy.
Okay, serena, i'm sorry that i had you stay here And sleep on this couch.
it's just--the stress of this movie Is making me feel like i'm losing my mind.
well, it sounds fantastic.
and i never knew josephine baker Was a part of the french resistance.
(whispers) it's an amazing part.
(normal voice) okay, there's this one scene Where we're trapped by the nazis, And i have to distract them while the others escape.
And i think It's probably the best work i've ever done.
(elevator bell dings) Chuck, what are you doing here? I would ask you the same question.
I stopped by your dorm last night.
no one was home.
Oh, i didn't tell you? I've been tutoring a few girls from constance.
We went late.
well, i found this-- An invitation to a movie premiere.
It appears your entire hall is attending, And since my evening is free You thought you'd help me curry favor With my outer-borough hall mates.
sweet.
But unfortunately, i've already scheduled An all-night cram session with my tutees, so Miss blair? you want me set beds before manicurists arrive or-- Thank you, dorota.
that will be all.
You're sure you said "cram session" And not the annual waldorf sleepover? Fine.
I'm hosting the sleepover.
But jenny humphrey is destroying everything i worked for, And those girls deserve to learn the meaning of aristocracy.
We both know it's not about that.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Now i have work to do, but feel free to attend the movie alone.
I have dr.
hannum.
he's english lit.
He studied with faulkner.
This is so nice of you, to help me.
Sharing wisdom is what college is all about, right? right.
That, and, uh, and finding the cheapest lebanese food.
(chuckles) Which, um, i-i-i thought i'd show you tonight, if Y-you know--you know what? i'm sorry.
That's--that's two nights in a row.
It's a huge dating taboo.
No.
no, it's that i have to work.
I was supposed to last night, and i blew it off, so Dan, i like you.
But i think my life is more complicated than you know.
Try me.
i think i can handle it.
Look, i-i-i really like you, too.
You're funny and smart, And you know what? I'm just gonna throw it out there--you're beautiful.
I mean, an alarming number of people Actually stop on the street just to stare at you.
And on top of that, you're refreshingly normal.
(chuckles) what do you mean by "refreshingly normal"? Um, well, the last girl i dated, Her--her life was never really out of the spotlight, So it made things kind of hard.
(cell phone alert dings) (sighs) I gotta go.
So can i-- can i call you tomorrow? Or Dan, i'm not sure i'm the girl you're looking for, Even if part of me wishes i was.
I'm sorry.
i don't understand.
You will.
i'm sorry.
(jenny) congratulations.
Your girlfriend's installed a puppet regime.
(scoffs) Blair's gone colonel kurtz.
She needs to be brought back to reality.
Help me.
I'll help you take back the crown.
Why? they don't want my kind of leadership.
They want a tyrant who will police their behavior And chart their movement on the social ladder.
Find someone else.
I need you.
you're fooling yourself If you don't think you were born to rule this school.
People change, chuck.
Not you, not about this.
The jenny humphrey who used to sit in brooklyn And watch the lights across the water, Who went toe-to-toe with blair waldorf And actually won her respect-- You can't tell me that girl isn't still in there.
Now that the dream is coming true, You owe it to her to live it.
Blair doesn't want me to be queen.
Well, maybe we can make her reconsider.
(door closes) (ursula in distance) where is it? you've lost it! Hold on.
where have you been? i had to get my dress.
what's going on? I don't know.
get in there.
My mother's ring--i lost it.
I cannot go to the premiere without my mother's ring.
It's my good luck charm.
Ursula, you--you put it in your bag yesterday.
here.
Oh, thank you.
(laughs) of course.
Honey, time's a-wasting.
you need to get ready.
(whispers) i'm so nervous.
It's gonna be great.
(sighs deeply) okay.
(laughs) Hey, is everything okay? I just heard from the producers.
That scene ursula's so proud of? It got cut.
What? We have to tell her.
Serena, no.
I know this is difficult, But if we tell her, she'll ditch the premiere, Which will hurt her career enormously.
Trust me.
no, this is for her own good.
(cell phone rings) Thanks.
i gotta take this.
(ring) (ursula) serena, can you help me? Can you help me with my hair? (cell phone alert chimes) Serena? Serena? i need help with my hair.
Hey.
(sighs) so i think i just got dumped.
You maybe want to go see a movie or something like that? Yeah.
a movie sounds great.
But you're gonna have to wear a suit.
Blair, o.
m.
g.
b.
s.
e.
Oh, my god.
best sleepover ever.
Yes, i suppose it is adequate.
Dorota, these martinis taste like tap water.
Don't be a scrooge with the gin.
Miss blair, this not right.
Mr.
chuck and i both of the opinion-- And who cares what you and mr.
chuck think? szybko.
Now who wants to hear how i got the great chuck bass (singsongy) to tell me he loved me? ?/i> Exquisite.
You exceed even my high expectations.
I'm only here for the good of the school, chuck.
And i'm only here for blair.
And now for one of the most time-honored traditions Of the sleepover-- truth or dare.
(cell phone alerts ding and chime) (girl gasps) Hey.
i'm not talking to hear myself speak.
Sorry, blair.
It's just Gossip girl says jenny humphrey's At the premiere of olivia burke's new movie and she's with Who? spotted on the red carpet-- jenny humphrey on the arm of the red baron, chuck bass.
guess queen b.
isn't starring in this melodrama.
Oh, my god.
(crowd cheering) (indistinct conversations) Rufus, why are you dragging me to this? You really couldn't wait till it comes out in the theaters? Are you kidding? nazis and cabaret singers-- It's like "casablanca" meets "showgirls.
" This is my dream movie.
how did you get tickets to the premiere? I have a connection.
Mom.
rufus, thank you.
No problem.
um, this is some event.
What is going on? did you two arrange this? Hmm.
i-i'm gonna go and, uh, Get another bag of popcorn, just in case.
So i got a job with a publicist, And i thought if you saw me working, You would feel better about brown.
Right.
yes.
Because, um, a year of parties and premieres is A worthy alternative to an ivy league education.
Mom Please don't make me regret inviting you here.
I've got a lot to worry about already.
Fine, fine, no brown talk.
Now tell me.
Well, um, i've become friends with ursula nyquist, And she's really counting on this movie And her big scene, which has been cut.
K.
c.
, my boss, doesn't want me to tell her.
Well, you have to, I mean, if she really is a friend.
right? But k.
c.
believes that it's for her own good, And--and k.
c.
's my boss.
This woman saw an opportunity to exploit your celebrity And your connections.
Why else would she hire an 18-year-old with no skills And no college degree? Maybe because she believes in me.
Serena, i've been looking all over for you.
Oh, ursula, this is my mom lily.
lily, this is ursula.
Nice to meet you.
hi.
nice to meet you, too.
Can i talk to your daughter for a second? Is everything okay? I feel like people are whispering.
No, every-everything's fine.
Look, w-we should get you inside.
Mom, i got work to do.
Oh, my god.
dan.
Hey.
What are you doing here? me? i could ask you the same thing.
You're supposed to be working, right? You're not serious.
see, it's fine if you didn't want to go out with me.
It's really--really--i mean, you didn't have to lie about it.
No, i-i didn't.
uh, you know what? i gotta find vanessa.
i'm sorry.
Vanessa? w-wait.
like vanessa abrams? Yeah.
she's--she's my friend, how do you know her? (sighs) dan, i-i have to tell you something.
O-olivia.
olivia, hey, can we get (camera shutters snapping) Whoa, whoa, whoa.
what's that? What's--what's going on right there? why are they Y Oh, my--oh, my god.
are you--you're not Fleur.
You are.
yeah.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
hey.
You met olivia? yeah.
yeah, apparently.
these are the plans from de gaulle.
i smuggled them in with my sheet music.
oh.
(man speaks indistinctly) germans.
they cannot be allowed to have these documents.
i'll distract them while you slip out the back.
but how? how else? i'll sing.
(fleur) i never heard her song, but i owe josephine my life, as does france.
next day, i was in london.
(ursula whimpers) (audience murmuring) (ursula crying) Hold on.
wait, wait.
she's in the stall.
We'll give her another minute, Then we'll let her go in front of cameras.
no, but i-i thought that was bad for her.
That's why we didn't tell her in the first place.
serena, an actress who finds out that her scene is cut And skips the premiere is a lame story.
An actress who finds it out during the premiere, Then has a meltdown--now that is great public theater.
So you lied to me.
Only because you couldn't deal with the truth.
I needed ursula to trust you, like i do now.
Ursula, honey, it's time to come out.
Serena's here.
(fanfare playing) (indistinct conversations) Did you really think that your lame attempt blair.
blair, stop it.
To embarrass me would you get back queen? blair.
I will make your life a living hell.
blair, calm-- It wasn't her idea.
this was you? Do you have any idea how much you humiliated me? I think you accomplished that With your little teenybopper sleepover.
Look, n.
y.
u.
's hard, But blair waldorf does not give up.
I'm not giving up.
i've made a strategic retreat.
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.
You don't understand.
I do understand.
let me help.
No, chuck.
n.
y.
u.
is not the upper east side.
They don't care about constance or the social hierarchy.
They don't care that i'm blair waldorf.
It's over.
And you'd do this to me? What are you talking about? I'm chuck bass, And i told you i love you.
You're saying i'm easier to win over Than a bunch Of pseudo-intellectual, homesick malcontents? You'd really insult me like this? That's not how it is.
It's exactly how it is.
So the next time you forget you're blair waldorf, Remember, i'm chuck bass, And i love you.
Hey.
Great movie.
You were, uh, you were amazing.
and i'm an idiot.
No, i sh-- I should have told you who i was.
Why didn't you? I have been dreaming of coming to n.
y.
u.
And just being a normal student.
And my very first day, This cute guy doesn't recognize me.
I couldn't help myself.
And my middle name's kate.
You said it yourself, That i was refreshingly normal.
I did, yeah, i You have to understand, though, That my last couple of relationships Have been just-- They--they've been full of drama.
All right, dan, i get it.
I do.
And as much as i want to be kate, I'm also olivia, And you don't want that.
I'm sorry.
I'll see you around.
Um, excuse me? Uh, can i take you picture? What? why? Aren't you blair waldorf? Yes.
Yes, i guess i am.
(camera shutter clicking) (chuckles) (crying) i can't believe they cut my scene.
So go out there and--and throw the biggest fit of your life.
I mean, those producers screwed you.
Go steal their show.
Serena, is that what you think i should do? I-i think If you want people to see you as--as a real actress, You should be gracious and And that the movie's more important than your scene.
Ursula, she's a teenager.
she knows nothing.
Kenny, shut up.
(sniffles) (whispers) thank you.
(sniffles) I'm sorry.
i-i couldn't do it to her.
I understand Like i'm sure you understand that you're fired.
I got fired.
K.
c.
wanted ursula To have a meltdown in front of the press, And i told her not to, so k.
c.
fired me.
I guess you were right.
well, it's for the best.
you'll love brown.
Mom, i'm not going to brown.
maybe next year, but not now.
What are you talking about? you're all packed.
If this year is about finding out who i am, Then i can't do that and live here.
Serena, enough is enough.
This need to find out who you are-- Do you think anyone really knows who they are? We don't.
we just live.
so that's it? that's your advice--to give up? I'm sorry, but i'm not gonna do this your way.
(sighs) lil, she's gonna be okay.
This is your fault.
That's not fair.
not fair? i go away to take care of my mother, And i come back and my daughter is not going to college.
I trusted you.
then trust me now.
don't force her.
Ugh.
I think i just need to be alone.
(indistinct conversations) Hey.
(door closes) I loved the movie last night, Though it was no "endless knights.
" Don't say anything.
i'm a closet fan.
(laughs) (chuckles) So i'm gonna pretend that you're not a movie star, And we're just two roommates.
Coming here, i just-- I wanted to be normal, everyday me.
And amazingly enough, i met someone who liked that person.
But i can't pretend that the other one doesn't exist.
I dated a guy who kept part of himself hidden.
He never gave anyone a chance to accept him.
And in the end, Everyone lost.
Dan's a really special guy.
I'm gonna go.
We're like real roommates.
That's kind of totally awesome.
(chuckles) Of course, s.
mi casa, su casa.
I sound chipper? well, i'm on my way to a meeting.
Just a little club i'm starting.
(beep) Oh, you all made it.
excellent.
Now here's the situation.
Each of us attended elite schools, Failed to go ivy and now find ourselves wasting away In a patchouli-scented purgatory.
Do we deserve it? no.
Do we need to put up with it? Definitely not.
What do you suggest? candide said, "on doit cultiver son jardin.
" Well, n.
y.
u.
is my garden, And i plan to rake and hoe and weed it Till it looks exactly the way i want.
But i can't do it alone.
now who's with me? You can count on us.
if you ask me, we go to the movies because we want to see fairy tales Oh, uh, by the way, that came for you.
(passion pit's "moth's wings" playing) a sleeping queen woken by her true love's kiss (cell phone alert chimes) ? That concludes our business.
So, uh, why'd you want me to take that girl's picture? Dumbo could always fly.
He just needed a magic feather.
a princess who puts aside her jewels to make her way in the world thank you so much for coming.
I wanted to see you before i went back to l.
a.
of course.
me, too.
and i wanted to tell you that i called k.
c.
, and i told her that if you do not work for her firm, I'm not a client.
(laughs) wow.
that-- that was so nice of you.
Please.
Serena, you helped me find myself.
And i hope you are just as lucky.
Okay? Come here.
(cell phone rings) lovers torn apart being brought back together (ring) uh Vanessa, hey.
Hey.
i was just thinking about you.
I thought i'd call and see how you were.
I'm good.
how are you? Good.
So, scott, i really was (call waiting beeps) hold on a second.
Uh, vanessa, i'm so sorry.
i gotta take this.
Uh, can i call you later? Oh.
Yeah.
Sure.
that--that's fine.
?you're just like a fire ? (snaps cell phone shut) Georgina, hey.
what's up? No, i'll be there in a second.
I'm a block from the restaurant.
but life isn't a fairy tale and happy endings are few and far between Hey, jenny.
is there anything we can do for you? in life, the young queen becomes a tyrant Actually, go make sure my spot's free at the met steps And wait there with a yogurt for me.
and takes her subjects to war And if you do want to wear them, you just need to make sure so that's why we need movies hi.
to remind us that despite it all, love can still spring in the most unlikely of places I was just thinking, i didn't really give you A chance to know both sides of me, And i guess I'm wondering if you still want to.
I don't even know why i'm pretending to think about it.
Yes.
yes, of course.
and that sometimes even fairy tales can come true.
x.
o.
x.
o.
, gossip girl.
gossip girl here- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
i really think we should cool things off for a while, you know,take a-- take a little break? we did say no strings.
right.
no strings.
you either tell me the truth, or we're over.
i'm rufus and lily's son.
georgina,hey.
i'll be there in a second.
things were so much easier when we were younger.
we just jumped into things.
why can't we just be more like that? marry me,lily.
the next time you forget you're blair waldorf, remember i'm chuck bass, and i love you.
scott,what's going on? i haven't told you the truth.
i'm your son's brother.
if you're looking for the first excuse to bolt** trust me,you're gonna find one.
i'm not looking for an excuse anymore.
i didn't really give you a chance to know both sides of me, and i'm wondering if you still want to.
i don't even know why i'm pretending to think about it.
yes.
yes,of course.
this is your fault.
that's not fair.
not fair? i go away to take care of my mother, and i come back and my daughter is not going to college.
i'm headed home to face the family firing squad.
considering what you did to us, being able to find you is gonna go a long way.
go ahead and run if you want.
you know how much daddy loves to hunt.
some say love is a river some say love's a silly song some say love is all around us it lifts us up where we belong some say love is hearing laughter in the rain but on the upper east side, we all know love is pain.
toasted blueberry? you spoil me.
dorota offered to make eggs,but i thought it was the duty of the devoted lover to provide.
i missed you.
yeah,you showed me just how much when i got in last night.
so how was your trip? did you get your money back from your poker buddy? no.
and i would have let it slide, but with my parents cutting me off trust me.
i get it.
working for k.
c.
is nowhere near as lucrative as being lily bass' daughter.
for now,toaster pastries are all i can afford.
so go.
talk to her for me.
fine.
but then you have to do something for me.
take my place at dim sum with my friends.
dumplings with blair and chuck? and nate.
you can do some recon.
blair hates nate's new girlfriend.
you can find out if she's really that bad.
i bet bree is perfectly nice, even though she is a buckley.
um,unfortunately,i-i do have more,um, people who owe me money to talk to.
fine.
eat up.
one second.
i'm telling olivia to say hi to godzilla from me.
it's funny,right? more so than your awful sushi puns.
well,i'm a terrible i.
m.
flirter, but as long as olivia's on this asian press tour, i have--i have no choice.
and anyway,you know,"sashimi later" is charming.
why are you using my screen name again? because every time i log on, georgina pounces on my i.
m.
i broke up with her.
i don't know how much more clear about my feelings i can be.
you could tell her you're dating someone else.
we all live on the same floor, dan.
when she gets back, she's gonna figure it out.
point taken.
i'll e-mail her later.
you talked to scott at all? i called him last week, but he hasn't called me back.
i guess he didn't like me that much.
really? it didn't seem like that.
i'm sorry.
i mean, i know you really liked him.
i did,too,actually, i guess, 'cause in a weird way, we were kind of related.
you know,i'm gonna hit the bleecker.
do--do you want a coffee? no,no,no.
you go.
oh.
the--the toilets in tokyo talk.
hi.
um,i'll have a nonfat latte.
sure.
hi.
did you miss me? georgina.
the bloodsucker is back.
i saw her coffin and telltale louis vuitton broom on the floor.
vampires don't ride brooms,blair.
leave it to georgina to start a mutant strain.
you know,my roommate and i didn't see eye to eye at first, so one night i bought ice cream cone cupcakes from the treats truck, and we bonded.
she taught me how to say "hello" in swahili.
" jambo.
" do you happen to know what the swahili is for "mind your own beeswax"? no reason,of course.
it just might be useful someday on safari.
blair,come on.
so,bree, you went home last week? yeah.
tried to mend the i'm- dating-a-van der bilt fence.
it didn't work.
we're southern,so family loyalty's really big down there.
like slavery.
what? i'm joking.
you know i'm joking, right,bree? so what's serena doing? she still dating baizen or she come to her senses yet? carter baizen? is he in town? i-i-i heard he was away on business.
he is.
traveling is so important.
bree,have you ever thought about traveling somewhere very far away? i wasn't aware you knew carter.
yeah.
our families used to vacation together on sea island.
i've been trying to track him down.
you guys mind if i order for the table? she was in shanghai last year.
Do you have Shuijiao here?() nate doesn't like tofu when it's called bean curd, and he hasn't eaten pork since he saw "babe," with me.
well,okay,um,i'll let you guys fend for yourself.
if you'll excuse me.
blair.
what? i'll go apologize for my girlfriend.
so you're happy with chuck.
don't i deserve to be happy as well? trust me,nate.
i know women, and none of us are that nice.
he'll be back soon.
he's in love.
you're looking for carter? the worm is dating my stepsister.
look,if he's done something to you,i need to know.
any enemy of carter's is a friend of mine.
i can't really talk about it,but,uh, you should tell your stepsister to be careful.
oh,and,uh,if the worm pops out of the ground, let me know,okay? that was,by far, your best wedding-- the flowers,the foie gras.
who would have guessed nine months later,klaus would haveauf'd? well,the worst thing is i thought he would make me happy.
i thought all of them would.
what are you doing here? i wanted to clear the air.
i'm sorry.
i know that you're disappointed that i'm not going to brown, and i know that you're angry that i left.
i'm not angry at you, serena.
i should have been here this summer to help you with the decision instead of leaving you here with yet another man who doesn't get it.
mom, what are you talking about? you and rufus are the perfect couple.
thank you for stopping by.
hey.
hey,what's going on with mom and rufus? oh,you didn't know?they've been in a cold war since the day you left.
over brown? oh,on the surface,yeah, but i have a feeling mom's flipping out about other things,too.
yeah,i think they could be in real trouble.
dad,hey.
what are you doing here? i've been running.
you've been running with jeans on?they didn't chafe? if you don't mind,i-i need to sleep in my own bed tonight maybe longer.
dan,hey.
yeah,hey,listen.
um, i know that my dad and lily have been having a rough go of it lately, but,uh,things may have taken a turn.
he's spending the night here.
oh,no.
they--they just need to sit down and talk, remind themselves of how much they love each other, before this gets any more out of hand.
i-i'm gonna figure out a way.
okay? i-i promise.
why won't he respond to any of my calls or- -or texts or my animated e-cards? are you serious? the last one i sent him was this adorable singing dog.
okay, dan didn't write you back, because "a," he broke up with you, "b," he's seeing someone else, and "c," even though i tried to defend you, you're a full-on crazy person.
wait.
can we go back to "b" for a second? he can't be seeing someone else, because we just broke up and okay.
then you're gonna get dan to dump her.
and why in the world would i do that? i didn't visit my family last week.
i was in boston.
you know,i met the sweetest guy.
i think you know him.
scott rosson? - oh,my god.
he just had so much on his mind, and after several glasses of wine,slightly enhanced, you wouldn't believe what he told me.
what are you saying,georgina? get dan to dump the whore, or i'm gonna tell the whole world scott's secret.
and that would be too bad, because "a," that's the last thing he wants, "b," how do you think dan's gonna feel when he finds out you've known his brother's been alive the whole time? and "c," who are you gonna hang out with when all the humphreys hate you? should we review "b" again? some say love's a secret you keep sealed.
but to georgina sparks, love's always a battlefield.
all right, so what's the emergency? dan,i hate to be the one to tell you this, but according to the,uh, "star," olivia's been spotted all over japan canoodling with orlando bloom.
you know,i'm not-- i'm not worried.
they're apparently very good friends.
so,uh,am i on speaker? also,uh,"us weekly" has her on baby bump watch.
probably just bloat,but i thought you'd want to know, especially with the orlando bloom connection.
right.
since when do you read gossip magazines? they're olivia's.
she subscribes to both, which also speaks a lot to her character,don't you think? look,vanessa, i don't believe that,obviously, and--and neither do you,so what are-- what are you trying to tell me here? i was thinking,don't you think that dating a movie star is gonna be kind of hard? i mean,wouldn't you rather be with someone from new york? who you have history with? look,i don't know if you're joking or if lenny made brownies for your floor again, but,uh,i'm--i'm kind of in the middle of something here, so,uh,we'll talk later.
all right? well,that was just pathetic.
haven't you ever tried to get somebody to dump a celebrity before? no.
that's okay.
plan "b.
" you're familiar with photoshop, i presume.
this is a great idea, guys.
i needed some family time.
let's order.
uh,no,no.
i'm still deciding.
jenny,you've eaten the same thing here every time since you were 11.
what's going on? well,if k.
c.
is texting you, you should go.
i will in a minute.
well,the three of us can do family lunch anytime.
some other you're kidding.
i knew i let you kids watch "the parent trap" too many times.
y--it's time for you two to talk.
you love each other.
and it's not rufus' fault that i made the decision not to to brown Can you please sit down for us? well,i do love the bolognese here.
i can't believe that actually worked.
i know.
i'm a genius, which doesn't quite explain why i'll be spending the day reorganizing k.
c.
's shoe closet.
gotta go.
carter is not who you think he is.
and i know you don't like to discuss this, but he wasn't the cause of my spiral,just a symptom.
and he makes serena truly happy.
what is this? it's incredible.
buntautuk.
i learned it from a master in chiang mai.
serena's deluded.
the guy's not capable of genuine feelings.
he's brought out a different side of her.
they're all happy and domestic,nested up at my mother's.
ohh! carter's at your penthouse? why wouldn't you tell bree that when she asked? he got in last night.
she just called me a couple hours ago.
anyway,why would i tell that future nascar mom anything? i hate her and the tractor she rode in on.
what you hate is nate moving on.
look,i love you,but nate liking bree doesn't make her a piranha, and serena liking carter doesn't make him a prince.
hey.
where're you going? i have tension.
so maybe i'm crazy, but i think vanessa's trying to get me to break up with olivia.
ooh.
evidence? no,it--it was this tabloid magazine thing.
and then she gave me this whole speech about how she thought i should be with somebody i share history with,you know? oh,mystery solved.
uh,yeah.
duh.
i mean,everyone in the state knows how she feels about you.
that's--no,come on.
no, that was-- that was years ago.
that can't be-- come on,dan.
have you ever seen a romantic comedy? this is the scene right before you chase after her and tell her that you can't believe how blind you were this whole time.
you really like olivia,though,right? yeah.
yeah,i do.
then you better tell vanessa that.
do you remember that night at amherst? we just opened for sonic youth, and it was pouring rain, and we couldn't bear another night in the van.
oh,and we sprung for a room in that quirky little inn.
the skylark.
you remember.
of course i do.
they served us wine in "welcome back,kotter" mugs.
i swiped horshack for you.
yeah.
that was a perfect night.
it was.
i know we talked about the pierre, but an inn like the skylark might be a cool place to get married in.
no offense,but you've already done the fancy wedding thinga few times.
don't you want to do something more us? well,yeah, that's great,rufus.
i'm sure that mayor bloomberg would feel perfectly comfortable toasting us with a freddie "boom-boom" washington cup.
that is so you,not us.
i'm sorry.
i didn't realize the mayor was coming.
i've never even met the man.
well,there are certain expectations that come with being lily bass.
you do understand that, don't you? maybe i don't,because every time we get to a good place, i do or say something that makes you angry.
well,that's because you can't compromise.
you know what? - maybe we aren't ready to talk.
maybe we're not.
oh,my god.
dan.
oh,my god.
what are you doing here? i can explain.
you know what? it's okay.
it's okay.
you can tell me.
all right? i'm your best friend.
i can handle it.
you're my best friend,too, but i don't think i can.
you know what? i know anyway.
i mean, i think i've known deep down inside for a couple months now.
you know,the way you broke up with scott - yeah,i had to.
the tabloid thing and the way you were weirded out - by me hanging out in the hamptons.
it's all right.
what? how does that have anything to do with but i gotta be honest,you know.
i really like olivia.
whoa,whoa.
dan,you're really off base right now.
and i mean,you know,i've always cared about you,always.
stop.
stop.
i'm not in love with you,you moron.
georgina's been blackmailing me.
what? why? vanessa.
vanessa,look, i'm you're best friend.
you can tell me.
you have to tell me.
what does she have on you? she knows that i know scottis your brother.
rufus? lily,where are you? where are you? i'm at the loft.
i-i came to apologize.
i don't know why i got so crazy.
you were right.
i am never really gonna understand this world i am now a part of, but that doesn't stop me from loving you.
it never has.
i love you,too.
well,we can keep asking each other if we can do this.
we can keep planning and talking and adjusting and talking some more, or we can just leap.
so let's leap.
let's get married.
we're already getting married, rufus.
i mean soon.
i mean tomorrow.
we leap.
oh,my god.
yes.
we leap.
put on those dancing shoes, kids.
looks like we're going to the chapel.
the whitney is a no, harvard club a no and colicchio laughed in my face when i asked about craft.
the only time i want to hear "no" is if ruth madoff wants an invite.
constance crew, what have you got? my sister's a florist.
she can handle the flowers.
great.
we've got cake.
my aunt owns a bakery.
she said she found a "cancellation.
" oh,i'm sorry.
my family's in investment banking.
they're all broke.
then you can go.
dorota.
i call the sonic youths.
they in north hampton, will try to make it.
acceptable.
hey,jenny,you okay? you've been working on that dress all night.
yeah.
it's like my own "project runway" challenge.
wow.
this is really happening.
are you sure you don't need any help? for once,don't worry about any of the wedding details.
you work on getting married.
and write those vows.
oh,i just finished.
then let me hear them.
yeah.
yeah,aunt irene.
so i'll--i'll see you then? okay.
yeah,the socks fit perfectly.
all right.
bye.
don't make me do this.
you know it's only a matter of time before georgina spills.
yeah,that's exactly why we should tell my dad.
dan,this was your idea.
lily and your dad are too precarious right now.
this is their wedding day.
you can't drop a bomb like that.
you're gonna have to hold georgina off for one more day.
you can do this.
be strong.
okay.
just,um,remind me later to kill you,please.
hey,dad,listen.
so i gotta go out for a couple of hours, but i will be back as soon as i can.
it's my wedding day.
where are you going? you don't want to know,but it's absolutely, absolutely important.
i promise.
"and watching the sun set over the ocean in santa cruz that day, i knew that rufus humphrey was meant for me.
" mom,are you kidding me? those could be the exact same vows you wrote for klaus.
you substituted lederhosen for doc martens and nice for santa cruz.
no,they couldn't.
oh,god.
i'm terrible at this.
what do i say? this wedding isn't like your others.
you're marrying rufus-- your soul mate,the love of your life-- talk about that and your futures together, what you'll do, all that kind of stuff.
god.
serena,i just got off the phone with the mayor's office.
he's agreed to expedite permits.
rufus and lily can get married at the brooklyn botanic garden.
it's perfect.
okay,what are we waiting for? amalia,new mean girls,go to the garden and get to work.
blair, you're on whip-cracking duty.
i'll deal with the caterers.
mom,just please work on those vows.
okay.
i'll handle everything else.
wow.
i wondered what happened to poppy.
i had no idea it was that easy to get someone deported.
that's--that is,um, that's--that's so thoughtful.
that's so georgina.
uh,you know,i really missed you while you were away.
you did? i-i heard you were seeing someone.
i was.
but she--it turns out she was dating orlando bloom behind my back.
can you believe that? - no.
yeah.
huh.
it is amazing how down that guy's star-o-meter has gone.
i shouldn't have been with someone like that.
you know,there's--there's no-- there's no history there.
in fact,i was thinking that maybe we could hit the reset button on us.
you know,like go on a date, something like that.
really? you want me to be your date at your dad's wedding today? i-i read about it on "gossip girl.
" uh,y-y-you know what? that's kind of a-- it's a private event.
it's small.
uh,so tomorrow.
yeah.
okay.
uh,that--that works.
great.
yeah,okay.
what does it mean when someone used to grab your ass but now doesn't? it means that someone's a big fat liar.
how is my favorite bridesmaid? working my butt off,but happy.
you're coming,right? i wouldn't miss you in something pink and poofy.
i'm serious.
i know you've been avoiding my friends, but this is my mother's wedding.
it's important.
i know.
you can't hide from them forever.
chuck is prickly.
i'll be there, and i'm not afraid of chuck.
i wouldn't pull out the suit quite yet.
i've spoken to bree buckley.
she told me everything.
did you tell her where i was? i told her there's a certain wedding at the garden that she and her family wouldn't want to miss.
you're setting me up.
no,i'm giving you a choice.
you can go to the wedding and tell serena the ugly truth.
even if by some chance she can stomach you after that, you still have to deal with bree,her family and a little thing i like to call southern justice.
or? i'm getting sick of being your travel agent.
this ticket's the last, and it's one-way.
georgina,hey.
so how'd everything go with vanessa? does she,uh,does she even want to see me? you know what? we're going to go surprise her right now.
let's buy you a tie.
looks like this wedding song just became "stormy weather.
" don't worry.
here comes the sun.
the sonic youth's stuck in traffic.
it's okay,dorota.
but next time,remember,mr.
chuck has a chopper.
hey,have you seen carter? i haven't been able to reach him on his cell.
its' still early.
he'll be here.
go.
flit.
mingle.
i'll keep an eye out.
don't worry.
i'm so glad you invited me,nate.
well,i'm just glad blair didn't scare you off.
what,are you looking for someone? no,no,i'm just taking it all in.
it's perfect.
it's the perfect location,the perfect weather.
eric,it's the perfect wedding.
i know.
carter is more than fashionably late, and it better be because he's lost his keys or he got hit by a pedicab, and not because of something you did.
trust me.
serena's life will be much better without carter, which is why i offered him an easy way out.
i don't care what bree buckley told you.
carter's a new man with serena, and this is her mother's wedding.
he won't miss it.
well,we'll see who's right.
in the meantime,i'm going to get a canap? i nearly choked.
she shoved her tongue right down my throat.
i- i did some great acting,though.
totally pulled it off.
it'll be worth it when you see them finally happily married.
you're right.
you're right,right? i hope so.
i'll see you soon.
try not to worry.
yeah.
oh,jenny,it's gorgeous.
thanks.
you know,lily,it wasn't easy for me when my parents split up.
and,uh, it was even harder when i realized my dad was in love with someone else.
but the truth is,i've-- i've never seen him happier than he is with you.
that is so sweet.
i-i can't wait for you to hear his vows.
they're--they're all about your future together, and i don't want to spoil them,but they're really beautiful.
okay,i'm gonna go,but you look amazing, - and i'll see you out there.
thank you.
looks like i was right,and you were wrong.
hey,you okay? no.
and you might not be either when you hear what i have to say.
a few months before we left to search for your dad,i,uh, i ran up some gambling debt.
i owed a lot of money to some scary people.
and then i met this woman--beth.
she was shy,kind,and,well,she fell in love with me, and i saw an opportunity.
she had money? her family did,and i knew they'd take care of my debts if it looked like i was about to be one of them, so i proposed.
the wedding was all planned, and she had her dress,flowers.
and i nearly went through with it,but i i didn't love her.
so what,you--you just disappeared? it's the worst thing i've ever done.
you buy this girl a ring.
you tell her you love her.
what--what,did you make her breakfast in the morning,too? - it's not the same.
carter,i have to go.
my mother's getting married right now.
i've been looking all over for you.
geor-georgina,hey.
what a--what a great surprise.
uh,i thought our date was tomorrow.
it is.
i just stopped by to give lily and rufus a wedding present.
hey.
what was that about? you look beautiful,lil.
come on.
can we just talk for a second? i don't get it.
e-e- everything came together for today.
i'm sorry.
i can't write my vows.
i mean,how could i when we don't agree on how to raise our children or how to get married or anything? what happened to taking a leap? but the stakes are too high.
ah,the wedding march.
here comes the awkward pause.
uh,uh,i'm sorry,everyone.
there's been a slight delay.
uh i'm sure there's just a tear in her hem or something.
i'll--i'll check.
and I'll be right back.
looks like the wedding dress might have a runaway train.
i-i can't believe you.
you want to know what our future looks like,lily? it looks like this.
we are going to fight.
we're--we're gonna want to kill each other sometimes.
that's what marriage is about-- not running away from every little problem-- sticking it out,you know,committing.
do you think you can do that or not? i,uh - i don't think i can.
wait.
so you're not getting married? - scott? - what? who are you? this is a private conversation at a private event.
how dare you.
what,do you know him? - oh,uh,uh, - yeah,that was - your love child.
yeah,not dead.
congratulations.
it's a boy.
ooh,ooh,love child.
things didn't get any easier.
might have to move the honeymoon suite to the heartbreak hotel.
wait.
wait.
what was she talking about? don't believe her.
georgina is a liar.
what is she even doing here? our son is dead,isn't he? isn't he? yeah,of course he is.
that was,uh,scott rosson,andrew's brother.
you know andrew's brother? - or that's at least what he told me.
dad,dad,dad.
lily um,scott,um,scott is your son.
i'm so sorry.
i was gonna tell you after the wedding.
i-i found out just yesterday.
scott is how is that possible? the rossons lied to you.
andrew wasn't your son.
scott is.
he wasn't ready to tell you.
i have to go find him.
vanessa,where do you think he went? he's probably headed back to boston.
he takes the chinatown bus.
i'm going to find him.
well,i'm coming with you.
he's our son.
we're doing this together.
i'm so sorry.
are you okay? will you just leave? please.
i-i need some time.
just so you know, i told you what i told you, because it's not the same with you.
i really do care about you,serena, so much.
hey,carter.
you remember my cousin beth's brothers,right? played defensive line for arnett mead? i'll be at the downing tonight.
we can't do this here.
they'll be watching you.
what? it's not like somebody else is gonna eat this now.
mmm.
hey,guys.
great wedding,huh? look,rufus,we just drove around the entire block.
he's not here.
vanessa was wrong.
the bus for boston leaves in eight minutes.
so he could still come.
you know,he could be anywhere.
let's go back to the bus stop.
what are you doing? let's go.
but what's the point? the point is we can still find him.
well,and if we do,after what-- after what i just did, i-- what am i supposed to say to him? that we're his parents and that we're here for him and that love can fix things.
oh,we both know that's not true.
you know what? i don't.
you-- what scott saw was you grasping at anything you can to push me away.
that is not true.
first it was serena and brown, then the mugs and the mayor, then it's that you can't see the future.
well,i'm scared of the future.
i'm scared of a lot of things.
you're scared because you're in love with me like you've never loved any of your husbands.
and unlike a bart bass,someone like me can break your heart, and that's terrifying.
and i know that,because right now you're breaking mine.
scott? scott.
scott.
s-stop.
this was a mistake.
don't say that.
all my life,i wondered about my real parents.
when i found out that they were you and lily, that you were back together and you were getting married, i guess i hoped that i'd find out that you gave me up 'cause you weren't ready, not 'cause you didn't love each other.
look,the difference is now i know we both want you, need you in our lives.
sure we got our problems, but lily and i love our children, and despite what you just saw,we love each other.
he's right.
he's the best father and the best man i've ever known.
uh,i am scared, because marrying you means finally giving myself a real partner, my children a real father, andfinally letting myself truly love.
lily.
i'm sorry,rufus.
and i'm sorry,scott that this is how you had to meet me, because all i thought about for the last 20 years is holding our child in my arms.
please give us a chance.
spotted--a family reunited,and it feels so good.
and i promise to eat caviar without spitting it in my napkin when we go to dinner at mayor bloomberg's, uh,as long as he knows when he comes to our house, he's eating my chili.
lily.
and,rufus,um, i know that our future will be just like us-- flawed and fragmented and full of more love than i ever thought possible.
i am so excited for you to be my husband and for our children, all of them to be my family.
well,by the power vested in me by a sketchy service on the internet i pronounce you husband and wife.
okay,we get it.
enough.
congratulations.
i'm so happy for you.
thank you.
where is carter? oh,he--he went home.
he wasn't feeling well.
you know all i want is for you to be happy,right? look,i have to admit,if you were at brown, this wedding probably never would have happened, - so thank you.
of course.
and i really am so happy you finally found the right man.
mm.
you're very lucky.
i love you.
i love you.
sorry for not telling you who i was.
you know what? i should have guessed.
no one under 40 has ever shown that much interest in lincoln hawk.
see,i told you.
he has my nose.
uh,maybe,but those are my eyebrows.
so,scott,what do you think about board games? - love them.
fantastic.
so hey,uh,vanessa texted.
she said she's sorry she couldn't make it back here.
i just i just wish i didn't put her in the middle of all this.
vanessa is an all's well that ends well kind of girl.
she'll be fine.
you thinking about sticking around? nah,i have to go back to boston, my family,figure my life out.
lily said there's an open invitation.
i'll definitely take her up on that.
maybe the holidays.
i'd love it.
i'm sure vanessa would,too.
come here.
hey.
i've been looking for you.
you okay? not really.
carter told me some stuff,and it turns out, he's not the person i thought he was.
the person he is-- i i-i don't really want to know.
look i may loathe the guy, but he didn't have to own up to anything.
he could have skipped town.
i even bought him a ticket.
he risked to going to the wedding, knowing bree would be there.
what,the girl he was engaged to was a buckley? he must really care about you.
do you think the buckleys would actually hurt him? they clearly want revenge.
i talked to blair.
so is it true? you used me to get to carter? yeahi guess i did.
come on,nate.
you're a van der bilt.
i'm a buckley.
and as much as i like you, that's always gonna come first.
it's in my blood.
it's texas.
if it means anything, - i'm sorry.
no.
no.
you know what? it doesn't so please leave.
carter,hey.
i just talked to chuck.
i just want to make sure you're okay.
call me,please.
i want to talk to you.
well,it took 20 years,but we finally made it.
well,i wouldn't have done it any other way.
this would be a perfect night except for the fact that georgina got away unscathed.
i wouldn't be too certain about that.
hi! i couldn't help but notice you.
i am prince alexi from belarus.
nice to meet you,prince.
i am flying back to my home country right now to celebrate my new oil pipeline.
any chance you want to join? you know,i'm pretty much over college, and,uh, well,who am i to say no to a prince? wonderful.
there are songs that make us want to dance, songs that make us want to sing along, but the best songs are the ones that bring you back to the moment you first heard them and once again break your heart.

,gossip girl.
gossip girl here- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
you really like olivia,though,right? yeah.
yeah,i do.
don't you think that dating a movie star is gonna be kind of hard? We're completely monogamous.
It's just one of our games, chuck plays the cheating b*st*rd, and i play the scorned woman.
what happens when one day you don't get there in time, and he actually kisses someone else? my parents are artists.
my sister's a musician.
just like going to an ivy is your family's way, not going to college is mine.
i met this woman.
i knew they'd take care of my debts,so i proposed.
so what,you just disappeared? it's the worst thing i've ever done.
do you think the buckleys would actually hurt him? they might.
they clearly want revenge.
but what truly defines tonight's honored guest is not something that can be easily categorized the distinguished-looking gentleman at the podium is an alumnus of the university.
he will go on speaking for a long time.
it is not important that you hear what he says.
in closing, those of us at the university will have had the pleasure of getting to know tonight's recipient, - know that she is a kind and gentle soul.
hey,you okay? what? no.
no,i am not okay.
her humility,her devotion, her love for us.
ladies and gentlemen, miss vanessa abrams.
no.
no! no! bad dream? don't tell me it was "charade" again.
i know how terrifying you find walter matthau.
worse.
i was in "all about eve.
" - that's not a hepburn movie.
i know.
i was bette davis.
i've never been bette davis before.
i'm audrey hepburn, not some plain baby jane.
who was eve? i couldn't see her face.
blair,we both know this is about n.
y.
u.
now it may take time, but one day you will hold that school in the palm of your dainty hand.
i'm audrey.
i'm audrey.
well,thank you,councilman.
i know my cousin appreciates your support.
yes,i'll be sure to tell him.
thanks.
when did tripp decide to run for congress? and should somebody tell him the election is not until next year? well, after congressman kruger died, a house seat opened up in manhattan.
you know grandfather.
he figured,why wait? well, it's nice of you to help.
mm.
well, tripp's a good guy, and with the buckleys buying up all these attack ads against his campaign, i'm taking it kind of personally.
yeah.
have you--have you spoken to bree lately? no.
you spoken to carter? not since my mom's wedding.
i've left him a dozen messages.
i don't know if he's mad at me or-- well,serena, that's why i called.
supposedly the buckleys are flying him out to galveston so he can work off his debt.
work it off how? - on one of the family oil rigs.
th-that's crazy.
it would take him,like, i think they're more interested in getting carter out to the gulf with a bunch of texas roughnecks.
so it's not like he's going to be making a lot of friends.
no,please tell me this is a joke.
don't worry.
i have an idea.
yes.
yes.
lily loves her jefferson airplane.
so,rufus, how is married life? well,at the risk of sounding like a man deeply in love, uh,each day gets better than the one before.
it must be,if you're packing these "welcome back,kotter" mugs.
they'll look great next to lily's china.
yeah,maybe we should hold off on the sweathogs.
"in just a few short months, freshman leader vanessa abrams has tackled numerous social and environmental issues.
" what is that? o h,it's just a wildly flattering cover story on vanessa in the n.
y.
u.
paper.
it doesn't mean anything.
except that she's a shoo-in to give the toast at the freshman dinner on parents' weekend.
dan,can i borrow your muscles? - is that true? - about the toast? - i i got a message from josh ellis.
he's the alumnus who decides who gives the toast.
supposedly it's between me and some other girl.
i probably won't get it.
well,speech or no speech, i-i hope you're inviting your parents.
you're kidding,right? my parents hate that i'm at a private college, "buying" an elitist education.
"knowledge shouldn't be for sale.
" sure,arlo and gabriela are progressive, but if they knew how much good you were doing at the school, i'm sure they'd come around.
it would be kind of amazing if they came and, you know,actually approved of something i was doing.
but whatever.
i haven't been chosen yet,so well,you will be.
and tomorrow night, dan and i will be there front and center.
oh,um,yeah,you know what? actually,olivia just got back from japan.
i was hoping we would hang out tomorrow night.
so bring olivia.
or not.
it's your call.
i-i don't want to force you.
what? what? we--we just started dating.
isn't it a little soon for meet the parents? not for olivia.
she seems really easygoing and into you.
yeah,seriously,dan.
play the parent card.
people like you more when they meet our family.
it's true.
all right.
okay.
a-all right.
i'll invite her.
oh,that's awesome.
it's gonna be a great night for the humphreys.
and who knows? maybe the abramses.
wait.
bree's cousin hosts a poker game? yeah,p.
j.
buckley.
picture, like, a young j.
r.
ewing in earnest sewn jeans.
and you really think he'll play for carter's debt? oh,i've seen his friends bet thoroughbreds, an island in the seychelles, the knicks.
okay,but what makes you think we'll win? you're not exactly a card shark.
well,this one night at the maidstone, bree told me every one of p.
j.
's tells.
so you'll know exactly when to call his bluff.
wait.
me? oh,yeah.
you're gonna be playing.
nate.
no.
well,serena,p.
j.
hates me.
i mean,luckily, he likes blondes,though.
and didn't you spend a summer in monte carlo with your mom, - when she dated carlos mortensen? - i was 9.
carlos taught me to play using necco wafers as chips.
well,just imagine carter owes the buckleys half a million necco wafers.
"and ms.
abrams has even been mentioned "as a contender to deliver this year's toast at the freshman dinner.
" oh,my god.
enough.
i am in no mood to hear you fawn over some girl with tacky accessories who lives to recycle.
blair, didn't you ask mr.
ellis if you could give the freshman speech? i put out feelers.
that's totally different.
of course.
i'd be honored, mr.
ellis.
thank you.
you.
yeah,blair,me.
f.
y.
i.
--one insipid article does not mean people here like you.
the fever will pass, like swine flu.
really? huh.
then i wonder why josh ellis-- he's this kind of important alumni liaison-- told me to start working on my toast for the freshman dinner.
what are you standing there for? get in here! i love it.
you know, cobalt's my favorite color.
push the button.
it's 11:45.
your hair is so pleasing.
it's a compliment watch.
and it flatters in three different languages.
oh,my god.
this is the eatest watch in the history of all watches.
the swiss should be ashamed for not thinking of it first.
so,um,what are you gonna do this weekend to thank me? uh,you know, actually,um,about that,i was thinking i would invite you to the parents' weekend freshman dinner with, uh, with me and my parents.
and i-i know you're probably exhausted.
i would love to.
really? are you sure? 'cause you heard the part about my parents,right? dan,the last three guys i dated-- i met their agent, their manager,their publicist, a personal trainer who also read tarot cards, and i never met a single one of their parents.
i would love to meet yours.
i missed you.
it's 11:46.
your teeth shine like diamonds.
it's true.
it's very true.
mm.
you've reached arlo and gabriela abrams.
pay it forward.
hey,mom,dad.
look,i know you guys aren't happy that i'm at n.
y.
u.
, but i'm giving this toast tomorrow night, and it's kind of a big honor.
and it would mean so,so much to me if you came, so i hope you can.
careful,v.
don't send out your invitations just yet.
we hear another girl has her eyes on the prize.
montesquieu,churchill, hobbes-- i'm thinking my toast should touch on tradition,virtue, the divine right of the monarchy.
but,blair, vanessa's giving the toast.
not when i'm done.
mao,sun-tzu,of course, napoli*-n's always good for a few zingers.
though things are rarely as simple as they appear.
this is josh ellis.
oh.
well i'm thrilled he changed your mind.
of course we'd still love to have you give the toast.
yes,there was another girl, but we hadn't fully committed to her.
we definitely want you.
great.
i'll see you tomorrow, mr.
ellis.
good-bye,jet lag.
hello,triple ristretto.
yes.
what was that? just a surprise.
and something tells me we're in for a show.
now,ms.
waldorf, if this is about letting you give the freshman toast, like i told you last week, i'd love to help you out,but-- actually,mr.
ellis, i'm here to help you.
simply put, vanessa abrams is a tired clich?from the 7-1-8.
the preachy "i hate the man" toast she no doubt has in mind won't inspire the kind of deep-pocket donations this school needs.
you need a speaker more like, well,me.
ms.
waldorf,yes,last week i narrowed my search down to two candidates.
but just moments ago,our first choice, olivia burke, accepted our invitation.
then why does activist abrams still think she's giving the toast? vanessa was the other student that we were considering.
you see,initially,olivia wasn't planning on attending, but then luckily, for everyone, her new boyfriend convinced her otherwise.
yes,she is very famous.
mm-hmm.
but she's a 2-quadrant speaker.
is it smart to lose everyone over 25 on parents' weekend? besides,actresses are notoriously unreliable.
ms.
waldorf,even if olivia's schedule did change, vanessa would still be my next choice.
soi'm very busy.
i'll see you soon,mom.
oh,no.
mnh-mnh.
you are not trying to steal my toast.
nobody told you.
olivia,your dear roommate, is giving the toast.
poor vanessa.
always the understudy, never the star.
olivia's the other girl? and i was the one who told dan to bring her.
irony certainly can be cruel.
did i overhear your long-absent mother is coming to hear you speak? tragic.
well,i'll just tell olivia how much this toast means to me, and then she'll step down.
yeah,probably.
though, then again,she might not.
nice try,blair.
well,i'm just saying, we all know olivia loves the spotlight.
she is an actress.
then i'll ask dan not to bring her.
another idea with some merit.
see,that's where you and i are different.
i would never put my fate in someone else's hands, and that's why i always win, and you lose.
so good luck with your honesty.
maybe you and mom could take in a show instead.
well,well,well.
nate archibald.
you looking for a game? i'm--i'm afraid we-- we don't have a seat for you.
oh,i'm not here to play.
she is.
that is unless you're afraid to play a girl.
buy-in's $25,000.
that's a lot of money.
so don't lose.
pull up a seat,darlin'.
you're kidding,right? - you're the one who told me to invite her.
i know.
remember the whole "people like you better when they meet your family" thing? exactly.
you don't want to be outshone by your family, and not to mention,she's been in japan for ten days.
i mean,she's probably having reverse culture shock.
yeah,okay.
all right.
so do you have any,non-insane reasons? well,i'm just saying,why don't you do something more casual but also romantic? dinner,just the two of you.
you can make your special chicken.
my special chicken? what? vanessa,what is going on? nothing.
uh-huh.
i need a refill.
okay,but you have to promise me you won't say anything, because this officially makes me the worst roommate ever.
just tell me.
olivia's freaking out about meeting your parents.
what? i-i talked to her, like,two hours ago, and she said she was looking forward to it.
i guess she changed her mind or doesn't want to hurt your feelings.
she just feels that it's way, way too soon.
yeah.
you know,i knew-- i knew this was gonna happen.
really? i mean,yeah,of course.
and i know this is my fault, but tell her you want to have a great night, - just the two of you.
and make my special chicken? - i'll give you a recipe.
okay.
hey,abrams,thank you for,uh,the heads-up.
what are friends for? trip queens.
it just-- it doesn't feel right, you know,taking a beautiful woman's money.
i'm getting crushed here.
hey,don't worry. p.j.'s on tilt.
this is where you hook him.
archibald,you want to call it a night? i can spot you cab fare.
just get him to bet carter and remember the tmbls.
actually,p.
j.
, we're gonna buy back in.
but we're upping the stakes.
what are you thinking of playing for? yeah,not likely.
how about carter baizen? ohh.
i get it.
you're--you're carter's girl.
well,bad news,sweetheart, carter's debt is a lot more than you're showing.
you know,can we get some, uh,some privacy? i tell you what.
you bet carter, and i'll bet a photo of tripp van der bilt from the night of his bachelor party.
your family will kill you.
that'll cost tripp the election.
like i said,don't lose.
let's play some cards.
i'm sorry to cancel on you like this,mr.
ellis.
you have a backup speaker, right? okay.
good.
all right.
uh,good-bye.
everything okay? um,dan has decided to cook dinner for me instead of going out with his parents.
he probably just wants more one-on-one time.
i'll bet he has something special planned,like chicken.
yeah.
or something.
yeah.
um,i brought you this.
it's an anime goblin claw.
they are huge in japan right now.
i just thought it was kind of funny.
thanks.
i shouldn't be freaking out, right? i mean, i can meet his parents anytime.
yeah.
um,i'll be right back.
okay.
hi,mr.
ellis.
no.
i'd still love to give the toast.
thank you.
tell machiavelli i hope she enjoys my toast.
vanessa's giving the toast again.
and she's got some big pink claw thing.
well,i don't know about that.
however,phase one is complete.
but even with olivia out of the way, you still don't have the toast.
oh,my goodness.
you're right.
thank you,amalia.
when are you going to learn to have a little faith? chuck,my love, i was thinking,remember our game from the summer? well,i have the perfect target already picked out.
so what's a sweet girl like you doing with a guy like carter baizen,hmm? you heard what happened to my sister,right? heartbroken, bet.
$20,000.
all in.
you sure you want to play this hand for carter? fine.
i'll call.
kings.
aces.
you know,a picture really is worth a thousand words.
or in this case,an election.
nate,thanks for stopping by.
uh-oh.
looks like carter's going down to texas, and tripp's career is going up in smoke.
hey. you made it.
hey.
rufus! oh! come here.
would you let me look at you? lay off the caffeine,huh? it's giving you wrinkles.
ah.
i'm sorry arlo couldn't make it.
he says hello.
he had to finish installing the solar panels on the chicken coop at the co-op.
we have been so busy organizing the local 72, the,uh,the union for the burlington cheesemakers.
aha.
yeah.
yeah.
mom,this is lily.
oh,it is such a pleasure to finally meet vanessa's mother.
gabriela.
oh,rufuswe're not in brooklyn anymore.
uh,uh,i'm still moving in.
it's lily's place.
oh,it is both of our place.
uh,mom,didn't you bring that for lily? oh,yes,i did.
homemade strawberry rhubarb.
thank you.
well,you and your husband must be so proud of vanessa.
oh,yes.
vanessa has always been a very thoughtful and driven young woman.
this school is the perfect fit for her.
well here we go.
to be completely honest,my husband and i don't believe in private universities.
knowledge should not be for sale.
well well - yes.
oh.
who's hungry? - lovely.
i must confess, i've missed our little game.
though it appears your lady is late.
actually,there she is now.
she's a guy.
who took my speech at the freshman dinner and gave it to vanessa abrams.
he double-crossed me,and i - demand satisfaction.
you still up for it? mm,my wonderful man.
i'll just go powder my nose for ten minutes? i only need five.
can i help you? oh,definitely.
i don't know if p.
j.
is not as stupid as he looks, but,nate,those tells were wrong.
what are you gonna do? well,of course i had to tell my grandfather what happened.
i mean,i have completely destroyed tripp's political career.
no.
no,nate.
let me talk to him.
please.
he needs to know that you were trying to help me.
i appreciate that, but i'm not dragging you into this mess.
oh, it's william right here.
nate.
no.
serena,i can handle it.
hello,grandfather.
is,uh,nate archibald in there? he's got a phone call-- p.
j.
buckley.
okay.
yeah.
i'll tell him.
thank you.
p.
j.
thinks he won the picture.
yeah,i have the real one.
i mean,i feel bad about lying to serena,but it worked.
okay.
gabriela,this strawberry rhubarb jam to die for.
thank you.
it's the agave.
i refuse to use sugar.
oh,rufus,will we be seeing daniel at the dinner? i had hoped so, but unfortunately not.
he has a date tonight.
with vanessa's roommate,olivia burke.
didn't she tell you? - lily.
she is a very famous actress.
i'm afraid i don't worship at the altar of shallow hollywood celebrities.
but apparently your school does.
mom,can you not do this right now? honey,these institutions are businesses first.
i mean,was this girl even qualified to enter or was it purely a publicity stunt? well,that's my shallow hollywood roommate and also one of the nicest, smartest people i've met at college.
excuse me.
hey.
how is your date? great.
dan's making indian chicken.
moroccan,actually.
oh.
uh,look,i know i shouldn't be asking you this.
i was just wondering, why did dan change his mind about me meeting his parents? i must have done something to scare him off.
you can tell me the truth.
i promise.
no,you didn't do anything.
well,i must have.
you know what? i'm just gonna ask him.
no! look,dan's parents are just really judgmental, and they're always going on about celebrities and the dumbing down of culture.
so he's worried his parents will think i'm some shallow hollywood pinhead? - no-- - like dan's embarrassed to introduce me to them? olivia,dan just wants to protect you from them.
you know what,vanessa? you don't need to make excuses for him okay? i get it.
i gotta go.
so where do you get your hair cut? oh,uh,trumper's, off piccadilly.
tut,tut.
i'm not that kind of girl.
do you have a boyfriend? not exactly.
wait.
what for? what the mr.
ellis.
blair waldorf.
oh,lord.
i-i have to go.
don't you run away from me.
hey! have you no sense of decency? well,you got your kiss.
number 27 on the tribeca scavenger hunt-- kiss the chuck bass.
check.
i expect more from a representative of a college! and the toast? oh,a deal's a deal.
it's all yours.
i should call vanessa, break the bad news.
allow me.
we're rivals, but friends at heart.
until tonight.
out,you cable-knit queen! you were late.
i got caught in a text flurry with dorota.
i'm sorry.
i have to get uptown for a dinner.
i assume you're skipping the parents' thing? i may pop in for vanessa's toast, just for laughs.
are you upset because you kissed a guy? i'm upset because i kissed somebody that wasn't you.
you really think i've never kissed a guy before? - love me? - always.
oh,well.
i tried.
hi.
guess i should,uh, work on keeping my opinions to myself.
you think? i just wanted to say, tonight i will promise to keep an open mind about your school, about everything.
when you hear my toast,i think you'll understand why this is the right place for me.
okay.
come here.
i hope.
so what do you think about going out to eat tonight? or we could just go to the parents' dinner.
are you sure? i mean,my parents are--are gonna be there.
well,then i better be on my best behavior.
pick me up in an hour? okay.
as for lonely boy, i suspect tonight's going to be strictly a family affair to remember.
i'll be right back.
i just have to find someone.
don't you just adore the national arts club? ahh.
it's so "age of innocence.
" are you looking for mr.
ellis? because he asked me to give you a message.
now what was it? oh,you're not giving the toast, i am,and there's nothing you can do about it.
what are you talking about? i won,like always.
please don't do this.
oh,my god.
are you begging? my mom is here,and you have no idea what this speech means for me.
please.
you're embarrassing yourself even more than usual.
when will you learn? some people are simply better than others.
don't worry.
i'm sure they're gonna love you.
so you think they're gonna want my autograph? i-i doubt it.
dan, what are you doing here? please.
miss the freshman dinner? dad,lily,this is olivia.
rufus humphrey.
dan has told us so much about you.
oh, that dress is beautiful.
i recognize it from the herve leger show.
oh,yeah?except it wasn't on the runway, so that's kind of impossible.
max azria's,like, one of my best friends.
he does me crazy favors.
are you feeling okay? - totes.
so anyone famous here? i mean,besides me.
you there.
you're one of blair's new minions,aren't you? you're chuck bass.
blair said you weren't coming.
my dinner canceled.
the emir had to fly home-- something about a revolution.
where is she? probably getting ready for her toast.
keep up,bambi.
blair's not giving the toast.
uh,yes,she is.
mr.
ellis promised if-- promised what? nate.
hey.
what are you doing here? serena.
i heard you talking to your grandfather.
why would you leak a fake photo? are you trying to destroy tripp's campaign? no.
that's gonna win tripp the election.
what are you talking about? once the buckleys leak it, we'll release the real photo.
it's gonna look like the buckleys planted the fake one.
people are finally gonna see them as the villains they really are.
and what happens to carter? you--you just used him? come on,serena.
he proposed to p.
j.
's sister to pay off his gambling debt.
wake up.
the guy's hardly innocent.
but i am sorry i had to lie to you.
no,you're not, but you will be.
manhattan,new york.
p.
j.
buckley.
no,i'm doing the mother teresa movie.
yes.
yeah,leo's playing my boyfriend.
i'm sure she'll be just a second.
well,let's just meet at your pad in the bu.
the bu--the bu is malibu.
oh,yes.
you know what? just give us a moment,please.
oh! wait.
i-i gotta go.
i love you,too,bitch.
what--what are you doing? what do you mean? you're referring to the bu, you're calling your astrologer.
since when do you even have an astrologer? i guess ever since i became another shallow hollywood celebrity, you know,the kind that you are so afraid your parents wouldn't approve of? what are you talking about? vanessa told me that's why you disinvited me.
vanessa? i-i blew this dinner off because vanessa told me that you were freaking out about meeting my parents.
what? i never said that.
oh,my god.
the lips,the teeth, the tip of the tongue.
the lips,the teeth,the tip of the tongue.
please tell me you're not coming here to grovel.
you really think you're that much better than me? oh,i think we both know the answer to that.
blair,i have to talk to you.
not now.
just listen.
i-- quiet! god,i've had just about enough of you.
sophie, you're minion number one.
amalia,you're number two.
so tell me once and for all, what makes you better than me? - do you really want to know? - yeah.
everything.
generations of breeding and wealth had to come together to produce me.
i have more in common with marie antoinette than with you.
and granted,you may be popular at some step-ivy safety school, but the fact is, the rabble is still rabble, - amd they need a queen.
you stole the toast.
i was willing to do what was necessary, including lying to chuck, the one person who trusts me more than anyone.
now if you'll excuse me, i have to give my toast.
actually,blair congratulations.
you just did.
oh,no.
oh,no.
sorry,ladies.
le jeux sont fait.
thanks for playing each other.
i know i shouldn't have lied.
it's just when mr.
ellis asked olivia to give the toast instead of me-- wait.
you were the other girl? wait a second,you were supposed to give the toast? why didn't you tell me? i wanted to surprise you with this nice toast about being here with your parents, and--and then you disinvited me.
well,i did that because you lied to me.
why couldn't you just tell me you wanted to give the toast? i mean,i would have given it to you.
i know.
i let blair convince me if i asked,you'd say no.
when i called and asked why dan didn't want me to meet his family, you said it's because they looked down on hollywood people like-- and they probably do now, you know.
i mean,you were-- you were pretty annoying.
i am so sorry.
i substituted my awful family for his amazing one.
i love rufus and lily, and i wish they were my parents.
vanessa? i just want to wish you luck.
mom.
chuck? chuck is gone.
but i need to talk to him.
i need to explain.
blair,whatever you needed him to do, do you really think he would have refused you? no.
he'd never say no to anything.
i messed up,didn't i? yes.
yes,you really did.
lily, you're supposed to say, "everything is going to be fine.
" where did you learn how to give a pep talk--guantanamo? blair,i understand a thing or two about ambitious women, but without trust, you're lost.
let chuck lick his wounds.
you can talk to him tomorrow.
serena.
you came.
i'm sorry for all the things that i said to you at the wedding.
i deserved them.
um, look, serena,i'm leaving tomorrow.
no,you're not.
i settled your debt with the buckleys.
what? how? it's a long story,but i helped p.
j.
avoid a very public fiasco.
nate probably hates me now, but it doesn't matter.
you can stay.
i didn't ask for you to save me.
i wanted to.
serena,this was my debt to settle,not yours.
if that means i have to go work on-- - work on an oil rig? carter,i wasn't gonna allow that to happen.
you have nothing to prove to the buckleys.
i wasn't proving it to them.
i was proving it to you, to myself.
i wanted to take responsibility for what i did.
i have to go.
no.
i saw the way you looked at me at the wedding, and i see the way that you're looking at me now.
i think i'd rather have you hate me than feel sorry for me.
please.
mom.
please.
i'm so sorry.
vanessa, we are so hard on you because we want you to challenge yourself to be your own person.
are we really wrong to--to question your decision to attend college here? i think it's time for you to consider who this place is turning you into.
your parents hate me.
i hate me.
we'll just explain what happened.
you'll be fine.
maybe she's different when they're alone.
maybe she's totally different.
oh,hey.
we missed you guys.
yes,very much.
oh,god.
dan, was that blair on the p.
a.
? she really should have run that speech past someone.

,gossip girl.
Gossip Girl Here Your one and the only source Into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I was willing to do what was necessary.
Including lying to Chuck.
I am K.
C.
.
I am Olivia's publicist.
I am actually looking for a job.
Have you ever thought publicity? How could 've you never heard of Olivia Brook That "endless knights" series It's King Arthur with vampires.
She plays Guinevere.
My father turned his first profit by the time he was 22.
I hope to do it by the time I'm 21.
The manager of the inn wants to meet you.
Horace Rogers, meet Chuck Bass.
Man, come here.
Constance is gonna be so different.
There's no more hierarchy, no more mean girls.
We're here to make sure you get exactly What you want this year.
You need to be cold to be queen.
Go make sure my spot's free at the met steps, And wait there with a yogurt for me.
All Hallows' eveThe one day of the year It's socially acceptable to play dress-up.
The only question iswho do you want to be? There are costumes to make men feel like boys again Or turn little girls into queens.
Jenny, please let me go through this closet.
There's no room for your new things.
Does this even fit you anymore? Yes.
Perfectly.
All of it does.
We're 183 on Travelocity, Right behind the Holiday Inn LaGuardia.
Who needs travel sites, With their huddled masses Searching the internet late night, trolling for deals? Without those masses I'm at less than 20% occupancy for the holidays.
That's why you should open the club.
Once that's the place to be seen, You'll be so booked, you can turn away The tasteless tourists in fanny packs.
I was thinking an '80s theme.
Although shoulder pads can be overwhelming On my delicate frame.
This is a business, not a high school party.
I told you I was sorry for my little transgression, And you forgave me.
Now either make me kiss a girl already Or let's move on.
I apologize.
I've been on edge lately.
With all my liquid assets tied up in this hotel, I have to make sure everything gets done right.
"Right" for the Chuck Bass I know means "right now.
" People think I'm playing a game, And they want me to lose.
I have to prove I'm not just Bart Bass' son.
My impulsive tendencies have no place In my life as a legitimate businessman.
Well, you're very sexy when you're legitimate.
Thank you.
I'm late to meet my accountant.
You understand I have to do this my own way.
Of course.
Mark? I want to book you for the opening of a new club.
All right, so I gotta ask.
Did you bring it? Yeah.
I got it.
Are you 100% sure you want to do this? Yeah, you know, I mean, Olivia and I have been dating for a couple weeks now.
It's getting pretty serious at this point.
I've waited so long, it's embarrassing.
Yeah, sure, but once you go there, you can't go back.
Believe me, I I know.
I know.
III really think I'm ready.
Oh.
Enjoy, man.
Six hours of pleasure.
So you really think the sight of Olivia in fake fangs Reciting stilted dialogue is gonna be a deal breaker, Don't you? Oh, the dialogue's awesome.
It's the, uh, it's the part without the talking.
That's the problem.
I think I can handle some PG-13 bloodsucking.
Come on.
Seriously, man, do you not get internet here in Brooklyn? Okay.
Patrick Roberts, who plays her vampire costar, Was her boyfriend the whole time they were shooting this.
All the blogs said they got really into it And started doing it for real, Like sex-tape- On-the-cutting-room-floor real.
I think the most disturbing part in all this Is that you've been reading "endless knights" blogs.
Okay, that'sI know you think you're okay with it, But you don't want to watch your girlfriend with another guy.
I mean, comparing looks and noises No, see, that's the problem with your theory.
I don'tI don'tI have no idea if she makes noises yet.
We haven't gotten to the noises stage, Although we, uh, we do have plans tomorrow night, so Hold on a second.
Maybe this is her.
Spottedone star with her hand in the cookie jar.
Even perez hilton knows our lonely boy Is going to be getting a halloween treat.
What the hell is this? It looks like olivia's picking up some free I know what she's doing.
I want to know why.
I assume it's because she wants to practice safe s*x.
She shouldn't be practicing anything Without patrick roberts, who's in toronto on a movie.
This obviously means you didn't take care Of the dan humphrey situation like I asked you to.
It's not a situation.
It's a relationship.
They're very happy together.
Well, since I'm not a couples counselor, Their happiness is irrelevant.
Serena, without "endless knights," Patrick is on the road to Mark Hamill-hood.
Is that the guy from "star wars" that's not Harrison Ford? Not dating olivia is the nail In patrick's culturally relevant coffin.
I'm not being ironic about vampire movies.
I'm sorry about patrick, but I told you, If you want dan and olivia to break up, That's something you're gonna have to do yourself.
Look, olivia's trying To be a "real" girl and not taking my calls, So I suggest you make yourself useful.
Unless, of course, you see yourself delivering James Franco's underwear for the rest of your life.
He needs them by noon.
I'll be in my office.
So rufus asked my size this morning.
Does this mean I'm getting a flannel? No.
He's just a costume enthusiast.
Oh.
He likes Halloween more than He likes Christmas and his birthday.
So we have to find a party, otherwise, I swear, He's gonna make us hand out candy, Dressed as the octo-babies.
Uh, speaking of creepy social anomalies The last time you handed her the yogurt, There was a spoonful missing.
Hmm.
Time to get to work ruling the kingdom.
You look queen-tastic.
Thank you.
And your yogurt with almonds.
It's all there.
I checked.
Are there skins on these almonds? Fix it, and in a timely fashion, Otherwise you're all going As the "real housewives of New Jersey" for Halloween.
I mean, even if there are other Dillingers at the parade, None of them will have One of Johnny's actual suits from the movie.
Jenny, you should come to the village with us.
Uh, yeah.
What are you guys doing sitting up here? The birds decided to use our usual place as a restroom.
Oh, gross.
Um, do you guys mind moving down a couple steps? I'm sorry, but you know The whole "no one's supposed to sit higher than me" thing, And if the girls see you up here, they're gonna take it As a sign of weakness and Wewe get it.
You can't lead if no one thinks they have to follow.
It's cool.
Thank you.
Not you.
Hello, "invasion of the body snatchers.
" Looks like Jenny, sounds like Jenny, Is really a dark, power-hungry monster.
Oh, come on.
She's still the same Jenny underneath.
She just has to wear the mask for school.
That mask is becoming her face.
Is she actually levitating? Uh, I'm pretty sure that's green screen.
Is their acting this good in the rest of the movie? I mean, just look at the way she's looking at him.
That'sthat's love.
That'sthat's definitely love And lust and, uh, and gratitude Dude, it's an orgasm.
Yeah.
I mean Pfft.
It's completely understandable why you're freaking out.
No, I'm not I'm not freaking out.
I'm just, you know, I'm processing this things.
Yes.
Yeah.
Oh, it's Olivia.
Yeah, I know.
I justI got this thing.
It'sit's like a flu.
Uh, can I call you in a couple days? Okay.
All right.
Bye.
Mark Ronson is on hold And I left word for the mixologist from Milk & Honey.
I thought Chuck didn't want to Open his club till after the holidays.
Well, that's what he says.
He also says he wants to do it his way, But that will change, just like it always does, When he sees my plan.
I don't know, B.
I tried to help Carter, and that just drove him away.
The good news is K.
C.
's yelling at me all the time, And I don't have time to think about it.
Oh, this is probably her calling now, Chuck, Hey.
Am I alone? It's obviously about a gift.
Serena? Yes.
Hi.
I'm here.
Sorry.
Hotels that don't book Over the holiday season don't make it to the next.
I'm sorry.
Are you in trouble? Do you want me to call my mom to see if Bass industries can help? I don't want Bass help.
I want a publicist.
Okay, great.
Um, well, I'll call Cond Nast and tablet hotels right away.
No.
I no longer have time for the establishment to accept me.
I need them to come begging.
I want to open my club tomorrow, Halloween.
See? My idea.
Okay, tomorrow.
Absolutely.
And, Serena, I don't want Blair anywhere near this.
Okay.
Bye.
I'm sorry.
Clearly, Chuck hasn't forgiven you.
Looks like someone's ghosts tricks past Have come back to haunt this halloween.
Swifty, you're the man.
No problem.
Everything looks good here, Mr.
Bass.
Thank you for moving so quickly.
I'm glad everything's up to code.
Up to code? Wow.
Not words I'd usually associate with Chuck Bass.
What can I tell you? It's the dawning oall back to the ol Moonshine Martini.
With a call back to the old.
This is perfect.
Thank you.
A speakeasy What could be more timely? A place to escape the modern world And violate its rules Legald so himself.
Yeah, I'm surprised Blair isn't here.
What, are you guys in another fight? A fight implies time and energy.
It's more of an ongoing detached distrust.
I can't believe he chose you over me.
I'm gonna ignore that because I knoou broke his.
But, B.
, can you please try to keep your voice down The only way I can prove myself to K.
C.
Is if she doesn't find out about this party Until after I make it amazing.
She'll try to take it alway It's not like Chuck hasn't kissed a guy before.
He said so himself.
Did it ever occur to you that maybe it's not about the kiss.
Your game is based on trust, and you broke his.
Me? What do you call him pretending he's not mad at me? That is the most untrustworthy thing I've ever seen.
I'm going to demand he let me help him.
Blair, I know this is hard to hear, But maybe today is not about you.
Chuck has 24 hours to create something from scratch.
His liquor license hasn't even cleared yet.
Hi.
No, I already faxed the permit To control the sidewalk in front of Gimlet.
Yes.
I know Chuck is anti-everything Bart Bass, But his father must have had a better way To get these things done.
Have you even been listening to anything I've been saying to you? Yes.
This is not about me.
It is about Chuck.
So I'm going home.
Hey, Lil.
Vanya has a package you need to sign for.
Who would possibly send all this candy? This is not package.
This is package.
This is for the trick-or-treaters.
Oh, I had no idea you would get all of this Or I would have called you.
Charles invited us To his club opening, and I want to go be supportive.
I'm sure vanya would love to take all of this candy.
We're not going to that club opening.
But I already got costumes.
Aren't you the one that keeps telling me I shouldn't embarrass the kids? Well, that's when you wanted us all To dress up like the ramones.
Well, Jenny would make a great joey.
This is a prohibition party Classy, elegant.
There's nothing classy About being at a party with your parents.
We can dress up and pass out candy.
sorry about that, vanya.
Sorry not to me.
Sorry to Mr.
Rufus when he sees no trick-or-treaters Come into this building.
I know.
He just seems so happy.
I couldn't bear to take his candy away yet.
Not bad, but it's prohibition, not "last of the mohicans.
" Lose the feathers.
You seriously think that's the same Jenny Who took the bus from brooklyn? If you don't believe me, just go talk to her about it.
I've got a better idea.
Did you make your own costume, Jenny? No.
It's vintage.
Gaultier.
No way.
What's your problem? Him.
No one's allowed to sit higher than you.
Hey, Jenny.
Jonathan, you know you can't sit up here.
Are you disobeying a direct order? Sorry.
The pigeons.
Bird poop is not our problem.
You guys will have to sit somewhere else.
Jenny, come on.
What'swhat's gonna happen If we hang out here for a couple of minutes? Girls? Wow.
Looks like you're feeling a lot better.
Yeah, thank you.
Um, yeah, it was, you know, it was just one of those, Uh, 24-hour things.
Um, it was kind of weird.
Dan.
If this is about that cookie jar photo If you're not ready, I totally understand.
Ready? No.
No.
I'mi-i love that picture of you.
It's so flattering.
And who can resist free gifts In, uh, in shiny wrappers? did you watch that? What? Okay, so it's not about the cookie jar photo.
You think that I'm a bad actress.
What? No, no, no.
I didn't I wouldn't say "bad.
" Which scene was it? Was it where I sucked that wolf man's blood? Because that was a dummy wolf man, And it's really hard to play with a dummy.
Look, hehe made you levitate.
Dan.
that's all acting.
Well, reigning blog opinion seems to be That acting with your boyfriend, without your clothes on It's, um, you know, it's a s*x tape.
Well, what the blogs don't know Is that Patrick was never my boyfriend.
Our whole relationship was strictly for publicity.
Have I ever told you what a great actress you are? Listen, I never had feelings for Patrick like I do for you.
Okay? So can we please get back to somewhat normal? Yeah.
Yeah.
Only if you promise to show me your free gifts.
Mm, well we can explore all of my health center acquisitions Tonight, after chuck's club opening.
Let me just let Serena know that we're coming.
Okay.
Why is M.
K.
Bringing two guests to some gambling club opening? I-i know you wanted me to make myself useful.
I'm sorry.
I-i wanted to surprise you.
By stealing my client list? Pack your things.
K.
c.
, wait.
I-i only did this because I was trying To get Olivia and Patrick back together like you wanted.
Olivia is coming tonight.
All you have to do is fly Patrick in.
Look.
Olivia's coming alone? Yeah.
This better work.
I promise it will.
In the future, The only surprises I appreciate are cash and gifts.
This is Chuck Bass again, Regarding the status of my liquor license.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Voice mail again, huh? With clubs closing all over the city, You'd think it'd be in their financial interest To expedite things.
The only "interests" those people understand Comes in envelopes full of unmarked bills.
I seriously hope you're not thinking About opening without a license.
No.
I'm considering what my father would do In this situation.
I'm trying to find a suitable alternative.
This is Chuck Bass.
Mr.
Bass, Frank Bennett from the A.
B.
C, Returning your call.
I wanted to let you know Your liquor license has been approved.
Effective immediately? I'll deliver it myself later today.
Thank you very much, Mr.
Bennett.
You see that, Horace? Victory without deceit.
Seems like little Chuck Finally stepped out from big bad Bart's shadow.
Too bad his girlfriend's still playing on the dark side.
What do you think? Does it really play without the other Ramones? I was gonna do Iggy, But I thought it might scare the children.
Well, not that I don't enjoy you shirtless and in eyeliner, But I do think you made the right choice.
I just don't want you to get your hopes up too high.
I know the kids care more about the candy than the costume, But I think they appreciate the effort.
Rufus, I know this is important to you, but honestly, I can't remember the last time we had trick-or-treaters here.
That's because no one thinks you're home.
Well, but this year I told them we'd be here, And they all seemed pretty excited about it, Except for that guy on six who never makes eye contact.
It's hard to tell what he's feeling.
Oh, Eric, my darling, are you sick? I'm not sick.
Then what are you doing home so early? Did something happen? Ask Jenny.
I'll handle this one.
I-I don't like the tickle.
Dorota, when I get you a gift, The least you can do is to enjoy it.
Oh, Mr.
Chuck.
My goodness.
When you are mad at miss Blair, Dorota is very tired And has to have the foot bothering And never sees vanya or movies Dorota.
That will be enough for today.
Is it safe to assume this visit signals The end of my community service hours? I wanted to apologize.
Last week's incident took longer than anticipated to move past.
But seeing as tonight's all about new beginnings, I wanted to put that behind us and make things right.
With gifts? I assume word reached you of my club opening this evening.
It was never my intention to leave you out.
I just needed to create it on my own, As a legitimate businessman.
It's beautiful.
I love it.
Good.
Serena, tell Dan that he should be a musician, not a gangster.
You have no street cred.
I'm offended.
You know, once in the fourth grade, I had to miss recess 'cause I purposely broke the rules of grammar.
I think Dan will look fine in whatever he wears.
Serena Van der Woodsen doesn't have an opinion on wardrobe.
Thatthat This isn't right.
Look, K.
C.
Wants you guys to break up.
Um, yeah, I know, And that's why I'm not returning her phone calls.
Did she seriously send you here to do that? No, I-I didn't come because I want you guys to break up.
I-I-i came because I have found a compromise That I think will get her off your backs and mine.
I hope it's firing K.
C.
Patrick is coming out for the gimlet opening tonight.
He's already on a plane.
I don't like where this is headed.
I have a gun.
I can get K.
C.
the publicity bump she's looking for If you're just willing to walk the red carpet with him, Just act like you guys are still together.
Well, no, right? Wh It's one night.
Uh, I'll do it.
Okay.
Dan, um, I'llI'll leave your name at the back door So you guys can meet up after the cameras.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You want me to pretend that we're not together? No, it's just It's just for the cameras.
Sometimes this is the way the business works.
Well, our relationship isn't business.
I just don't understand why you would want To go somewhere with your fake boyfriend Rather than your real one.
Dan, I'm sorry, and I hope you'll come And meet me inside tonight.
I don't know why he's blaming me.
I didn't do anything.
I can't control every girl at school.
Well, Jenny, you and I both know that that's not true.
You may not have done the deed, But I suspect you gave the order.
He sat above me on the steps.
That must have put you in a very difficult position.
Yeah, and he did it on purpose.
He knew that I'd have no choice.
Lily, please.
My dad would never understand, And you know these girls.
I had to do something.
Yes.
Just like I have to do something now.
But you and dad already gave us permission - To go to Chuck's tonight.
Well, and you can, As long as Eric still wants to go with you, And you make sure that all of your so-called friends - Apologize to him when he gets there.
Fine.
Horace, put this up behind the bar.
Thank you for taking care of this so promptly.
It's my pleasure.
I'm always happy to help out Jack Bass.
Are you ready to open the cornerstone Of the new Chuck Bass empire? You decided this was the way to impress k.
c.
? What? Chuck, I would never call Jack.
You might convince me more if you weren't The only one who knew about the problem.
Blair, Blair, did you call Jack? Well, you have the liquor license.
What does it matter who called who to get it? JackIs the last person I would call for help.
You're still mad from before.
It's clouding your judgment.
This isn't about last week.
It's about you, Blair.
It's the reason why I couldn't say "I love you.
" It's not a game.
It's because I knew I couldn't trust you.
I did this because I love you.
Be that as it may, I have a club to open, And you're no longer invited.
Fine.
S come on.
We're leaving.
Blair, I'mSorry.
I'm gonna stay with Chuck.
You're alone, Nate? What's wrong? You don't have any friends left to screw over? Oh, well, at least I'm on the list And not working the door.
Text me when Patrick arrives.
All right.
I thought you said that this was an exclusive party.
Eric's over there on the phone.
Yeah, he ratted me out to our parents, So now I have to be nice to him - At least to his face.
Sounds like you have a plan.
I do, and one that won't get me caught this time.
Follow me.
It's a queen's job to protect her king.
Chuck should be thanking me for making his club possible, Not treating me like some useless pawn.
It's hard to love a powerful man.
You think I'm trustworthy, don't you, Dorota? Of course, Miss Blair.
Knight to Queen 7.
Tell those pathetic trick-or-treaters There's no prepackaged joy for them here.
Thank you.
See? I knew he would come to his senses.
I told you this wasn't my fault.
What does Mr. Chuck say?
They're not from Mr. Chuck.
Dress, Now!
Here you go, Mr. Policeman.
And here you go, Mr. Fireman, And, uh, Lady Gaga.
Wow.
You kids look terrific.
Thank you.
They're perfect.
That's it, shut it down.
Let's move, people.
Party's over.
Let's move, people.
Let's go, you guys.
You gotta gimme that drink right now.
Chuck, you might want to try to stop the police.
Why would I stop 'em? I called 'em.
Why would he have his own club raided? Well, once we found out the liquor license was fake, We could either wait for Jack to call A.
B.
C.
To take us down Or we could take control and call the police To blow up the party for a night that no one would ever forget.
Brilliant, isn't it? - This was your idea? - Oh, it was both of ours.
You see, S.
, we belong together.
Okay, well, K.
C.
Blames this whole thing on me.
Now I have to go get my clients out of here Before they get mug shots or tmz videos.
Oh, you could try to go through the hotel.
Thank you.
But there's probably paparazzi out there, too.
I'm sorry, S.
, but Chuck's hotel needed this.
Without your celebrities, we're buried in the city section.
Now we're front page news.
Why would you do this to me? You knew how important it was for me to prove myself to K.
C.
Remember when you chose Chuck? Now I did, too.
Bye.
Happy holloween.
What'd I tell you, Lil? We just had to put the word out.
Once these kids tell their friends, I'll bet we get at least a hundred next year.
A hundred? Rufus, I hope you don't I'm just teasing you.
You got the perfect number.
How did you figure it out? Well, after the third time I heard "achoo," I realized it wasn't a sneeze.
It's "thank you" in Lithuanian.
Plus, Lady Gaga forgot to change her hair - When she came back as Taylor Swift.
Well, I just didn't want you To feel you had to leave all your traditions in Brooklyn.
And I love you for that.
But why don't we start some of our own traditions? How about some grownup trick-or-treating? All right, but I draw the line at door-to-door.
I was just thinking of one door.
You know, we, um, We should probably get out there eventually.
I know.
Um, there's something that I Dan, um, Patrick wasn't my fake boyfriend.
What? I know.
Um, I lied because I-I care about you.
And I did not want you to compare yourself To some perfectly lit, heavily edited performance.
Andand what about tonight? Why get photographed with him? When I ended things with patrick, I-I broke his heart.
And with no more "Endless Knights" movies, His career just kinda stalled.
You don't think it was because of the Bruce Jenner biopic? I mean, that was Dan, my plan was to tell him afterwards That the only person I want to kiss here tonight isis you.
Okay? Okay.
You really need to work on your timing.
Actually, my timing is perfect.
Follow me.
Come on.
I'llI'll explain.
Hurry.
Okay.

It's Olivia Burke Kissing her boyfriend Dan Humphrey.

We're already up 50%.
Now do you see I'm trustworthy again? Blair, you and I both know You'll never be completely trustworthy And I admit, it's not my strong suit either But it's part of what keeps things interesting between us.
And why we make a great team.
No, in order to be a team, We need to focus our duplicity on others.
But what if it's my way of showing you I love you? Oh, I can think of better ways.
So I can handle being in the "she's dating him?" page Of "in touch" if you can handle not having a fake boyfriend.
Mm.
I couldn't be any happier with my real boyfriend.
Actually, that's not true.
I-i could be a little happier.
Is vanessa still at her sister's gig in albany? Yeah.
Oh, well, I'm feeling a little happier already.
Uh, justjust to confirm, That levitation thing was just a special effect, right? Um, there's only one way to find out.
So I guess that means you heard about jonathan.
I guess it does.
I wanted to call it off But as soon as those girls see me hesitate, I have a full-blown rebellion on my hands.
You could have warned jonathan.
Come on.
Everyone gets egged on halloween.
You didn't.
You know I have to act this way about school stuff.
But I'm still your friend.
I'm still your sister.
We just can't let the worlds get confused.

And, - Serena, that job now includes Publicly dating patrick.
I don't know if I'd call that work.

Why settle for some club in a hotel When you can just buy the hotel? I'm worrying.
Politics is a van der bilt birthright.
The only thing nate's ever voted for is "american idol.
" Tripp was the same way.
Grandfather can be very persuasive.
When did tripp decide to run for congress? Well, after congressman kruger died, A house seat opened up in manhattan.
Dan, i have to tell you something.
(Man) oh, olivia! Oh, my god.
Are you-- You're not Fleur.
I lied because i-I care about you.
The only person i want to kiss here tonight is you.
Why would you leak a fake photo? Are you trying to destroy tripp's campaign? That's gonna win tripp the election.
And what happens to carter? I am sorry i had to lie to you.
No, you're not.
I settled your debt with the buckleys.
Nate probably hates me now, but it doesn't matter.

A michael mann political thriller? That's good news.
Wonderful news.
And my source tells me Michael's only considering two actors for the lead.
Patrick and ryan phillippe.
Well, then he's in.
Ryan totally lost his mojo After reese got with jake.
Don't "jake" me, serena.
This is serious.
Your job is to get patrick's photo taken with politicians At the van der bilt election party tonight.
But, k.
C.
, i can't.
The producers will eat it up.
Plus, it'll totally help him Get into character for his audition next week.
So i look forward to hearing how it goes.
Wait, k.
C.
, the problem is i'm I'm kind of on the outs with the van der bilts right now.
Serena, what's p.

No, that one.
Hey.
How long you been awake? Mm.
Not long.
A muffin basket.
Vanessa's been completely m.
I.
A.
Since she started shooting that documentary.
She was here for, like, ten seconds yesterday, And i guess she's getting amazing footage.
The only footage i want to see is your jimmy fallon appearance.
I mean, dinner was great last night.
I just wish we'd gotten back in time to see it.
Yeah.
Sorry i-I dragged you to that gelato shop.
I had a really bad sugar craving.
(Chuckles) You know what? I bet it's online.
No.
Uh, you can't watch it like that.
Th-The--The quality's so bad, you know? I'd rather you watch it in h.
D.
Okay.
When? I'm sorry.
I'm just excited.
It's been a while since i had A girlfriend on a late night talk show.
Um, well, i'm--I'm sure i can get a copy from k.
C.
Okay.
(Door closes) (Sighs) Ho ho! Watch out.
It's bathroom boy.
Clear the way.
(Laughs) Uh, good morning to you, too.
(Chuck) welcome to my new suite.
We may patent the media system-- Interactive, high-Def 3-D gaming.
Instant access to the world's largest media library And all in-House food, spa services.
Just touch the button.
Blair's favorite part-- Real-Time surveillance playback.
It's naughty.
(Chuckles) Well, it certainly is a step up from the columbia dorms.
Most penthouses are, nathaniel.
There's two bedrooms.
Feel free to crash any time you like.
Tripp, maureen.
(Tripp) hey, chuck.
Hey.
All this behind-The-Scenes stuff is really great.
Thanks again for letting me film tripp's campaign.
Oh, no problem.
Charles.
Well, you've outdone yourself.
My pleasure, sir.
I can't think of a better way to christen the ballroom Than with a van der bilt victory party.
Your generosity will not be forgotten by me or my family.
We're very much looking forward to tonight's event.
Thanks again, chuck.
Even if the night ends in defeat, At least we'll have a good party.
Sweetie (chuckles) don't talk like that.
This morning's polling numbers aren't great.
We're down where we should be up, and where we are up, We're barely hanging on.
That's what makes it exciting, right? (Chuck) excuse me.
He's right, nathaniel.
Things aren't where they should be.
The buckleys' dirty pool is starting to work.
Thanks to serena, we weren't able to expose it.
Well, isn't there something we can do? It's election day.
At this point, nathaniel, It would take nothing short of a miracle.
Hey.
I was running errands, And k.
C.
Asked me to drop off your jimmy fallon interview.
Great.
I guess that means you've seen it.
Yeah.
You know i didn't mean what i said.
Oh, don't--Don't worry about that.
I'm sure dan understands.
He hasn't even seen it.
I don't know what to do.
I have to fix this, And meanwhile, keep him away from tv and the internet And strangers with the urge to make fun of him.
Don't forget about gossip girl.
I have to just keep him completely isolated.
Oh, hey.
What are you doing here? Um serena just, uh, came by To tell us how much she likes patrick.
Oh.
Yeah.
(Chuckles) uh, oddly, he's my favorite part of my job.
It's actually pretty fun having a fake relationship.
Talk about no pressure.
I'm slightly relieved.
I heard some pretty crazy stuff about patrick after we broke up.
Supposedly he went a bit method After that gus van sant movie he did nobody saw.
Yeah.
His--His agents and k.
C.
Are filtering all the scripts that get to him.
So far, he's only been allowed to read a political thriller.
What's the worst thing he can do, pass a bill? Listen, as much as i enjoy my current girlfriend talking To my ex-Girlfriend about her fake boyfriend who is also My current girlfriend's ex, uh, you--You--You could probably Get us a copy of that fallon interview, right? But first, um, serena, You should probably get to patrick's Before fedex does with more scripts.
Good-Bye.
Okay.
Bye.
(Door closes) S.
I hope you're not here looking for an apology.
No, i was just dropping something off to olivia.
Oh, that's right.
I momentarily forgot your job Is more important than your friends.
I have a couple minutes.
Do you want to get a latte? If by "getting a latte" you mean apologizing, then no, i don't.
Out of respect for our many years of friendship, I'm willing to let what you did slide.
What i did? Okay, we both made decisions that hurt the other.
We both feel badly.
Now let's move on.
I actually have to go meet chuck right now.
We've been going nonstop, prepping For tripp van der bilt's election party tonight.
Speaking of which, i noticed you're not on the guest list.
That can only mean one thing-- Nate still hates you For whatever it is you did to him.
I'd check your sources, b.
And i am going tonight, with my handsome boyfriend, patrick.
Since your boyfriend's working the party, Who are you going with, one of your knockoffs? Since you're so interested, i have made real friends here.
I just don't share your need to brag.
Okay.
Well, i can't wait to meet them tonight.
I need a friend.
Stat.
I'm your friend.
(Scoffs) Please.
I'm not friends with staff.
(Cell phone rings) you need to get that? (Beep) no, it's not important.
This is nate.
Leave a message.
I'm just saying, if this morning's polls Put you neck and neck with sullivan, Then there's still time, so why not let grandfather help you? Nate, i've said it before, and i'll say it again-- I'd rather lose fair and square than win with a dirty campaign.
Yeah, well, asking grandfather for help Doesn't necessarily mean playing dirty.
(Vanessa) so it's election day.
Who are you voting for? (Man) hey! Someone's drowning over here! Call 9-1-1! (Man) help! I can't swim! Help! I'm drowning! It look like tripp's prayers have been answered With another miracle on the hudson.
Are the van der bilts blessed with good luck or good timing? (Man) you're watching new york 1-- News all day.
Just this morning, Congressional candidate tripp van der bilt Rescued a man who was drowning in the hudson river.
One minute i'm walking along the pier, And the next thing i know i lose my balance, And boom! I'm in the hudson.
If it wasn't For this brave young man, tripp van der bilt apparently van der bilt was on his way to his Ten hours till the polls close.
Let's seize the day, gentlemen.
Where are we with media? I've locked down coverage from every local station For the midday news.
Time to call couric.
She owes me a favor.
Maybe she can squeeze tripp into the evening news.
Excuse me, grandfather.
Can i speak with you for a moment? Zogby has them neck and neck.
Rasmussen puts him up by a point.
(Laughs) tripp, that's fantastic.
Remember, until the polls close, any time someone mentions The name tripp van der bilt, It should be followed by the word "hero.
" (Lowered voice) well, i guess miracles do happen, Huh, grandfather? Our family is really blessed.
So is that man who almost died.
(Woman) william, can you take a look at this? Absolutely.
No, thank you.
Thank you so, so much.
Hey.
My rescue footage is gonna be on the news tonight.

I've gotta go home and get my tapes together.
Okay.

Oh, that's funny.
So is my cousin's campaign, thanks to you.

You used me for your buckley photo scam.
All i did was find out and undo it.

You look hot.
Same.
I have great news.
Yeah.
So do i.
You first.
I just finished reading a fantastic script.
The political thriller? No, it's a remake of "leaving las vegas.
" They want to redo it with a younger cast.
Where did you get those scripts? In the garbage.
I'm telling you, this one's amazing.
Care to join me in a little research? No.
No research.
Your team has been pushing very hard for the political one.
And i have worked my butt off to get you into this party tonight.

They must've seen her on that pole at the t.
C.

Forget vegas.
It's all about d.
C.
, okay? Put on some clothes, please.
Hey, vanessa.
Listen, i'm really busy.
Uh, this couldn't wait? Honestly, no.
And i thought it'd be better To talk away from the campaign chaos.
Mm.
I'm in a really awkward position, So i'm just gonna say what i have to say.
Okay.
What happened at the hudson this morning Wasn't what it looked like.
What do you mean? The guy you and tripp saved-- He didn't fall.
I think it-- I think it was set up.
(Scoffs) that's ridiculous.
I have it all on tape.
Well, has anyone else seen the footage? No, but i-I already agreed to sell it to new york 1, And i'm going to meet caroline lowe, One of the producers, at cafeteria.
Whoa.
Wait.
Vanessa, if you do that, then-- Nate, i'm sorry, But if i just sit on it, i become part of a cover-Up.
Listen, the polls close in a few hours.
Can you just-- Can you just wait? I wish i could, but this is not Some high school thing with blair and the mean girls.
This is someone running for public office, nate.
Yeah, but there's gotta be some sort of an explanation.
Someone set tripp up to look like a hero, And i think we both know the person most likely To orchestrate something like that is your grandfather.
(Sighs) i have so much respect for tripp, And he has been so generous to let me film his campaign.
Should i warn him so he can prepare a strategy For damage control? Don't worry about telling tripp.
Okay? I'll tell him.
I'm sorry, nate.
No.
This election may be too close to call, But when it's his family's honor or his own, Nate archibald has the number on speed dial.
Yes, uh, new york 1, please.
Caroline lowe.
Wow.
Thank you so much for explaining that.
Hey, we were just discussing The senate committee on appropriations.
Maybe you'd like to join us.
Oh, my god.
Hello.
Thank you so much.
See? Isn't this great? You've got the--The perfect capitol hill vibe.

That's senator proctor.
Wow.
You really do know everyone.
Oh, i don't know everyone.
I'll be right back.
Hey, blair.
Hey.
Do you see that gorgeous blonde in proenza schouler Talking to those high-Profile politicians? That's my best friend brandeis.
She knows most of them personally.
Oh, that's great.
I mean, political connections Aren't the first thing most people look for in friends.
They must really love her, Because when she introduced us, they seemed thrilled to meet me.
They even asked if we were sisters.
Well, i can't wait for you to meet patrick.
He's over at the bar, getting me a drink right now.
I feel so lucky.
He's so attentive.
It doesn't take much, does it? What? No one's ever accused you of saying no.
(Scoffs) Hey, where is the scrabble dictionary? I could swear "squiffy's" a word.
Oh.

My computer.
(Groans) Hmm.
Hmm.
You know, i am sensing something else is going on here.
Well, you didn't actually think they wanted To play five hours worth of board games with us, did you? Mm.
(Hollywood holt)  these girls be in my face   that's why i grab that can of mace  (sighs)  because i got expensive taste  looking for your boyfriend? Uh, no.
He's probably getting mobbed by fans right now.
He's--He's just still on the way to get us a drink.
Doubt it, Because he downed both your drinks And then ordered two more-- For himself.
Where is he? Don't worry.
I took care of it.
I had him taken up to his suite.
What? Why? He's bombed.
He's drunker than paula abdul during hollywood week.

So you're out with this guy, and he goes to the bathroom.
Yes.

That's when you get out.
That's when you have to leave, yes.
Really? No, i find out later that on the way Into the bathroom, he's walked into a spiderweb, And the spider crawled inside his shirt.
Yeah, the old-- The old spider excuse.
(Laughter) yeah, we've all used that one before.
Yeah, the old "oh, a spider came down on my shirt, And that's why i had to take my shirt off and"-- Okay, that-- Yeah, i believe that.
Yeah, i would believe that one.
And--And now are you still dating bathroom boy or jimmy.

You're the only one who knew I had a meeting to sell that footage.
I had to protect tripp.
I came to you first, as a friend.
Don't be so self-Righteous.
You were only selling the footage To further your own career.
That is not true.
Oh, so you're saying you weren't excited to see your name Flash on every television in manhattan? You know what, nate? I'll let you know how that feels In just a minute.
What does that mean? (Man) hey.
Hey, everybody, quiet down for a second.
with breaking news.

It seems after close inspection Of the footage taken at the time, it's apparent The man deliberately went into the hudson river (Gossip girl) the polls are closed, And gossip girl is calling this election dirty.
It remains to be seen Who exactly is responsible for this hoax.
Someone in the van der bilt camp? Maybe the candidate himself? But news of this breaking grandfather.
effect it'll have on the polls Is impossible to measure.
All right, could someone just turn that off? And, please, just give us a moment of privacy.
Thank you.
I can't believe You would compromise my integrity like this.
Take a deep breath, tripp.
You didn't believe i could actually win, did you? Honestly, i had my doubts, But i did not do this.
The hell you didn't.
Tripp, just calm down.
Listen to me very carefully, grandfather.
If you don't go out there And take responsibility for this, then i will-- By stepping out of the race.
I'm not gonna go stand in front of those cameras and lie.
Oh, come on, grandfather.
It's time to come clean.
I give you my word.
I'm not responsible for this.
Unfortunately for the both of us, Your word means nothing anymore.
Well, if you are both done, I'm going to go down and join the celebration.

I'm going to announce my official withdrawal.
I just have to tell maureen first.
I know i'm an enemy of the state right now.
What happened to you, nate? The guy i used to call my friend Had a moral compass.
Well, right now i'm thinking i'm just gonna go for my master's, But who knows? Sorry to interrupt.
Brandeis, right? I'm serena.
Hi, serena.
This is congressman wade.
Pleasure to meet you.
And are you a, uh, student, like brandeis? No, i'm just a regular old working girl.
Really? And--And do you two work together? Because maybe the three of us-- Uh, congressman, you've been campaigning a little too hard.
(Laughs) (laughs) Let me guess-- You want to go upstairs And see if two blondes make a right? Uh, excuse us.
I'm sorry.
I thought i was working this party alone.
Did the agency send you? No, you're right.
This party is all yours.
Excuse me.
As a friend of the family, what do you have to say About the allegation That tripp van der bilt's heroism might have been staged? Uh, i say i'm a businessman, not a politician.
Fine, so how will it affect your business If the empire's inaugural event is mired in scandal? Look, you think anyone goes to the mercer for the maid service? They go 'cause they want to see russell crowe throw a hissy.
Anyway, nothing happens at the empire without my say-So.
What are you doing, blair? Looking for your best friend? Bad news.
Security just escorted her out In time to avoid a major political scandal.
You're kidding me.
Now we're doing tit for tat? She was an escort, a high-Priced hooker.
(Scoffs) you're ridiculous.
Brandeis is not a call girl.
She's a psych major.
Who on earth told you that? Patrick.
The guy is wasted.
He thought chuck schumer was his father.
You're just trying to get back at me.
No, actually, i'm just looking out for chuck and nate.
I doubt chuck would want a prostitute at his hotel, Especially at this party.
You don't get it.
Patrick was about to cause a scene.
I was protecting everyone, including you.
What are you talking about? Look, ladies, please.
This is supposed to be a classy event, Not a sample sale at an outlet mall.
Chuck, you'll never believe what serena did.
She had my friend kicked out of the party.
(Chuckles) the call girl? Security just told me.
W--No, no.
I promise you, brandeis is not an escort.
Serena's just trying to get even with me.
Look, i don't know what's going on here, But if the girl's still here, i'll find her And get to the bottom of it, okay? Thank you, chuck.
And who's the one getting paid to date her clients anyway? That's enough, blair.
No.
If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck The only prostitute here is you.
Come on, chuck.
I want some cake.
(Grunts and gasps) (Gossip girl) blair and serena at war again.
Yummy.
Hey.
Let me go first.
Nate, it's okay.
I know what i'm doing.
(Amplified voice) excuse me.
(Microphone feedback whines) excuse me.
Hi.
My name is nate archibald.
I'm tripp van der bilt's cousin.
And i know there's a lot of buzz going around About what exactly happened This morning at the hudson river.
And it saddens me to tell you all That the story about it being a hoax-- It is true.
(Guests murmuring) However, my cousin, tripp van der bilt, Had no knowledge of any kind of setup.
My cousin is not only the most moral, Honest And courageous guy i know He's still a hero.
And how do i know this? Because i'm the one who set it up.
(Guests murmuring) What the hell is wrong with you? Right now, thirst.
I need a drink.
She called me a prostitute.
Yeah.
Why do you think she did that? I'm not sleeping with patrick.
You, of all people, know what a prostitute does.
The reason blair attacked you is because she misses you.
Don't tell me after 18 years, you can't read waldorf subtext.
I shouldn't have to.
If that's what she's feeling, then she should tell me.
It is time for her to grow up.
This coming from someone Who just pushed their best friend into a cake.
Look, you think your friendship is going to take care of itself.
You're not kids anymore.
You can't say you hate each other Then make up an hour later on the met steps.
You tell her that.
I'm telling you.
And you should be careful, because one day you're Gonna find yourself telling people about blair waldorf, The girl who used to be your best friend.
(Knock on door) Hi.
I got your text.
Yeah.
All it said was-- "Maybe we should talk"-- And so i just came right away.
I'm sorry about fallon.
Up till now, my publicist would decide everything for me-- What i'd talk about during interviews And even script exactly what i would say.
And just this one time, i wanted to just be myself And--And go out there and be me, and i i bombed.
What? No, you didn't.
No.
No, it was funny, really.
And then today, you left, and i knew--I knew that i'd hurt you.
And our first date meant so much to me.
Olivia, fallon was right.
The spider story isn't even true.
What is--What is this? You want to know the truth about our--Our first date? There was no spider.
I, uh, i-I was so nervous That i was with you, i kept sweating through my shirt, So i was running to the bathroom to use the hand dryer to-- (Laughs) What? This isn't funny.
Don't laugh.
I'm not--I'm trying-- I'm really trying not to.
(Laughs) and then today, I rushed out of scrabble because i'd just seen Your interview on tv, where you told the whole world That today was our 1-Month anniversary, you know, and I mean, i'm--I'm usually very on the ball with these things.
Stop.
You're amazing.
And you're not the only one with a surprise today.
(Man) you're watching new york 1-- News all evening.
Before we return to the race for the mayor of new york city, We first want to take you to the congressional election, Which really couldn't be any closer.
At this time, with 85% of the votes counted, Mike sullivan has 49,837 votes.
Hey.
What are you doing down here? Get back to your party.
I was hoping you'd still be here.
I wanted to thank you For the sacrifice you made on that stage tonight, For me.
Hey, i was happy to, Because i believe in you.
Here it is.
And apparently, new york does, too.
We are now prepared to call the election in favor Of newcomer 26-Year-Old william van der bilt iii, Affectionately known to those around him as "tripp.
" That is right.
With 96% of the votes counted i won.
Yeah, you did.
Just do me one favor, though.
Anything.
Be the best congressman this district's ever seen.
(Cheers and applause in distance) I have complete faith in you.
And after all, i mean, You're the only honest man in our family.
(Sighs) Congrats.
Thanks.
You deserve it.
I better get going before we're seen together And another scandal erupts.
I promise you, One day i will make things right.
I will fix this.
This is the beginning of a new van der bilt dynasty, One we can be proud of.
(Chuckles) (Woman speaking indistinctly on tv) (Laughs) Stay away from me.
Blair, i'm sorry.
I-I shouldn't have done that.
But whether it was patrick tonight Or--Or k.
C.
'S clients at chuck's party, A real friend would have come to me with the problem, And we would have solved it together.
Seriously, serena? After 18 years of this, i actually feel sorry for you.
You're so far deep in serena world, You can't even recognize what's really going on.
Throughout all my years with nate-- My whole life, really-- You've always been number one.
And now for the first time, Things are different.
I'm different.
I have college And a real relationship.
I'm starting to build a life for myself.
I'm building a life for myself, too.
With carter? With your job as an assistant to a publicist Who pays you to date a whacked-Out movie star? You're drifting away from dan and your family, And you've lost nate, One of your oldest friends.
(Sighs) This night is finally over And as far as i'm concerned, so are we.
Who would have thought That s.
And b.
'S friendship had a term limit? Sorry, ladies.
Party's over.
Thank you.
Hey, brandeis.
I thought you'd be long gone by now.
Hey, blair.
Great party.
I am so sorry.
I can't believe serena Told everyone you were a prostitute.
That is, like, so crazy.
Well, to be honest, it's not that crazy.
How so? It's true.
I'm a working girl.
I wanted to tell you, but we just met.
Ew! Do you even go to school at n.
Y.
U.
? Yes.
And i am a psych major.
Ask me anything-- Freud, skinner, piaget.
I'm still the same person, blair.
This is just how i pay for college and couture.
Huh.
Well, i have to run it by my people, but We can still shop together, perhaps.
Absolutely.
But right now I got a job.
You used me to meet new clients? Sorry, but i'm new to the big apple.
And rotten to the core.
Okay, come on.
Come on.
Let's get you in.
Easy.
Come on.
Watch your head.
Hey, come on.
Let's go to bar boulud.
No.
You have to.
You're my girlfriend.
I can't be seen without you, remember? That's what you get paid for.
Tell miss cunningham she has a delivery.
(Indistinct conversations) I think nathaniel was brilliant tonight, don't you? Brilliant? Foolish is more like it.
Come on, william.
Even you have to admit it.
This couldn't have worked any better if it was planned.
You.
All this time, you thought the only thing i was capable of Was holding his hand and smiling on the sidelines.
To be honest, my dear, I never really spent that much time thinking about you.
Well, your loss is my gain.
My husband is a congressman.
And thanks to vanessa's camera, You're out of our lives for good.
Finally tripp can be his own man, My man.
You think i'm really just going to stand aside, Let myself become collateral damage? I'll tell him.
You don't exactly have a lot of credibility right now.
Who's he going to believe? (Mika's "i see you" playing) I thought you said you were going home.
I changed my mind.
Well, if i'd known, I would have come sooner.
 i'm sitting across from you  Did you ever find brandeis?  i don't speak  Yes.
 you don't know me  We're not friends anymore.
 i say nothing but stare at you  But that's okay.
I have you.
That's all i need.
 but i see you   but i see you   but i see you  (Woman speaking indistinctly)  but i see   conversations, not me at all  (Gossip girl) sometimes it's hard to see The lines we've drawn Until we cross them.
 hating everyone  (Jimmy fallon) this is used for the sake cups.
All right, oh, you know, i did want to say something.
Uh, we want to apologize for last time.
I was a little hard on your boyfriend, And i apologize for that, so, dan, if you're watching, We wanted to say happy anniversary.
Oh! This is for you, olivia and dan.
Happy anniversary.
I'm very sorry.
Thank you.
Oh! (Gossip girl) that's when we rely on the ones we love To pull us back And give us something to hold on to.
 but i see you   i'm standing across from you   but i see you   i've dreamt alone  Congratulations, congressman elect.
S-Serena, thank you.
 i've dreamt alone  Shouldn't you be in the ballroom? Probably.
Where's your better half? I don't know.
I was looking for her.
Then i realized this might be My last private moment for a while.
Well, i can leave.
No, it's okay.
Stay.
Please.
I'd love to have someone to sit with, Not talking about politics, not talking about anything.
You wanna tell me about it? No.
I-I don't think you want to hear this one.
I do.
Let your problem Be the first that i address as your elected representative.
Okay, congressman.
(Laughs) But i'm gonna warn you.
This one might need a special committee.
Uh, wait.
This sounds serious.
Bartender, i'll have what she's having.
Uh, i'll have another, please.
Thank you.
 but i see you  Then there are the clearly marked lines, The ones that if you dare cross, You may never find your way back.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, gossip girl.

[Laughs]
Gossip Girl here your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
How have you never heard of Olivia Burke? You know, that "Endless Knights" series has made, like, a billion dollars.
I have been dreaming of coming to NYU - and just being a normal student.
This night is finally over, and as far as I'm concerned, so are we.
Where's your better half? - I don't know.
I was looking for her.
Well, I can leave.
It's okay.
Stay.
I'm not sick.
Then what are you doing home so early? Did something happen? - Ask Jenny.
I'm still your friend.
I'm still your sister.
I just can't let the words get confused.
I want nothing to do with you in either world.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Have you been so busy that you've forgotten what time of year it is? Let me give you a hint couture, quadrilles and cutthroat competition.
That's right.
It's time for cotillion.
This guy's a foot shorter than me.
Here's one that's 6'2".
Yeah, and he goes to York.
That's practically public school.
Have I not impressed on you three how important tomorrow night is? It's my debut in society.
I have to be perfect, and that means having the perfect escort.
I told you who I wanted.
We tried.
Well, try harder.
Graham Collins is the hottest guy on the upper east side.
There's like this bubble Of perfection around him - that we can't penetrate.
Well, you better figure out a way.
Otherwise, tomorrow night I'm taking one of your escorts.
Just like the mob, New York prep schools have their own five families, you may be the John Gotti of Constance, little J.
, but that doesn't mean you'll ever be part of this Cosa Nostra.
Oh, my God.
Everyone's here.
Come on.
Let's go say Hi.
I have a surprise for you.
In that case, Why are you still dressed? - That was yesterday.
Today we're seeing the Kandinsky Exhibit and having dinner at E.
A.
T.
Well, I'd love to, but I think you've forgotten today's Nate's move-in day.
We're celebrating with a lost weekend.
I never signed off on a lost weekend.
Do you really think I wanna spend my weekend watching women with tramp stamps work out their Daddy issues? It's for Nate.
Anyway, You'll be busy with cotillion.
Aren't you supposed to be a mentor? And risk running into Serena? No, thank you.
Though it does kill me to imagine those poor girls stumbling along without my guidance.
Isn't it about time you and Serena made up? You love cotillion.
You should be doing it together.
Don't the festivities begin tonight? There's a dinner at the Van der Woodsens' for debs and mentors.
But knowing Serena, She'll probably flake.
Or she'll be waiting for you, apology in hand, and really, a debutante ball without Blair Waldorf is like a Tour de France without Lance Armstrong.
I resent the comparison to that man-whore.
Though your other point is well taken.
I suppose the charitable thing would be to give Serena the opportunity to beg for forgiveness.
Don't get too lost, Bass.
A lot of my responsibilities from K.
C.
's office would translate to this job event planning, writing press releases.
Okay.
"Okay" as in I have the job "Okay"? What? - Just like that? - You make a good case.
Also, I remember our summer relay races at Nate's Hamptons house.
Underneath that smile is a heart of a killer.
Me? Need I remind you of the potato sack race incident of 1998? I still have evidence of your unsportsmanlike behavior.
Although given our new circumstances, I maybe have to forgive you now.
Um I should, uh, I should probably go.
I, uh, I'm a mentor at cotillion this year, and my mom asked me to host a dinner at our house.
Of course.
Well, we're here all day every day.
But I'll see you Monday.
Great.
Thank you so much for asking me to come in and interview.
Our talk on election night really meant a lot to me.
Me, too.
I didn't realize We were hiring.
Could always use another person, right? Do you think you can get brain damage - from learning too much too fast? - No.
You're the one who wanted the real college experience, - cramming for exams.
I know.
Oh, my God.
No way! - Please tell me that Guinevere will use the unholy grail to free Lancelot from Arthur's eternal torture.
"Endless Knights 4"? Why didn't you tell me? Because it's not happening.
Those rumors have been going around forever.
But Warner Brothers sent out a press release.
I'll never trust Harry Knowles again.
Sorry, guys.
It's not happening.
If it were true, I'd have about a hundred phone calls about it by now.
Crap.
I'll be right back.
I'm sure it's not true.
Though it'd be kinda awesome.
All right, debs, enough socializing.
Uh, we have a lot to get through, so if you'll please find your escorts - and take your places - Um, Lily, um, as you know, I don't have my escort situation fully ironed out yet, so Oh, that's okay.
Um, Maximillian here will, um, dance with you today.
He is divine.
I think it'll be great to have some one-on-one tutoring because I know you have some catching up to do.
Ca-catching up? I, uh, this was the first rehearsal.
I know, but, um, the other girls have been taking ballroom for years, so you will be great.
You have your father's natural rhythm.
Um, I'm just gonna get a drink of water.
Okay.
Hey, Jenny.
Hey, Jenny.
Hi.
Uh, you're Kira, right? I'm Eric Van der Woodsen.
Our mothers arranged for me to be your escort.
Oh, right.
So humiliating I couldn't get my own date, - but thank you.
Well, it'll be fun.
You're Jenny Humphrey's brother, aren't you? That's my new claim to fame.
Those girls who hang out with her are so lucky.
Who's her escort? - Well, she's obsessed with getting Graham Collins.
Graham lives in my building.
We've been neighbors forever.
I could - Not breathe a word.
I know Graham, too.
I went to camp Suisse with him.
I could probably introduce them myself.
So why don't you? Because, uh, Jenny hates it when other people get involved in her personal life.
I would definitely stay out if it - if I were you.
Really? - Absolutely.
So you ready to dance? - Sure.
Just let me get my shoes.
All right.
Okay, ladies, find your escort.
I want to make her remember why she came to college The the part that doesn't involve the library or waking up with a textbook stuck to your face.
I think if we can do that, then we got a fighting chance at keeping her here.
You mean like "the 15 things every college student must do before graduating"? Uh, yeah, exactly that.
Uh Yeah.
No, we haven't cheered ourselves hoarse at a sporting event.
We haven't gotten sick after a beer pong tournament at bar None.
We haven't had s*x with someone We don't want to see again.
Well, no, actually, I I did that one with Georgina.
True.
You know, but we haven't done any of this Falafel at Mamoun's, Frat party crawl.
It's for real this time.
My parents, manager, three of my agents Are all flying out from L.
A.
on Monday to convince me to do it.
It's like "the sopranos," but with bagels.
Hadn't they all agreed to give you this year for college? - Well, that's what I said, but it doesn't really matter.
I'm pretty sure they're on the phone with the dean right now, getting him to let me finish classes from location.
I mean, how do I fight that? By telling them that college is about a lot more than just classes.
You don't have beer pong on location.
What? We'll explain on the way.
But your college life begins now.
You don't know the dances.
No, I do.
I I You'd think that it would be enough to just be the queen of Constance, but, no, then you have to be the queen Of the entire upper east side, which means having the perfect escort and I'm just gonna make a complete fool out of myself, aren't I? Probably.
You know, I I really thought that if I made the perfect debut, people would finally forget that I'm just a Brooklyn nobody.
It helps If you count out loud.
Eric, you don't have to be nice to me.
I've been so awful to you and Jonathan.
It's true.
But I'm a better person than you are.
That's also true.
Come here.
There's only one official dance.
You can learn that easy.
Eric Stop complaining.
Start counting.
Ready? One, two, three, four, out.
One, two, three, back in.
You know, I wish that you could just be my escort.
At least then I'd have fun.
I'm gonna turn you.
Okay.
Um Well What about Jonathan? He's not Graham Collins, but he is a Whitney.
Debuting with Gertrude Whitney's great grandson will count for a lot with the deb ball crowd.
Walk.
Well, do you think he'd even go with me? Well, he will once I talk to him.
Well, then I'll have my minions call off the search.
Thank you.
In the complicated world of debutante balls, one must choose her dance partner wisely.
You never know when a hand on the hip can lead to a knife in the back.
Excuse me, please.
Blair.
Serena.
Anything you want to say to me? Welcome.
I see.
That's it? Uh, well, there's a list of debs and their mentors on the coffee table.
You can find out who Lily assigned you to.
My deb's right here, right, Jenny? Uh, yeah, Serena's my mentor.
Why? Oh, of course, if that's what you want.
It's just a shame.
You know how I feel about your potential.
Blair, are we really doing this right now? I gave you a chance to apologize.
How about you apologize? - I'm here, aren't I? Okay, look, I have enough of my own problems, so I'm not gonna let you guys make me a pawn in your war.
War? What? Of course not.
Who's your escort? Jonathan Whitney.
Your stepbrother's boyfriend.
Do you remember who my escort was? Nate.
Jenny, when you descend those stairs tomorrow night, everyone there will judge you, based on that moment, for the rest of your life.
This is not like your wedding day.
Cotillion only happens once.
Now you already have one strike against you because of the whole Brooklyn misfortune and add a "b+" escort and top it off with a mentor who's known more for her mug shots and topless photos in Ibiza than her social graces? Okay, you're right, Jenny.
You know what? You shouldn't be caught between Blair and me.
It's not fair to you on your big night.
She can be your mentor.
It's fine.
How selfless.
Actually, I'm working for congressman Tripp Van der Bilt, and I should get back to that.
But you have fun tonight.
These are probably the last people in New York who still think you matter.
May I take your coats? No.
I'm sorry.
I don't want to.
Jenny feels bad about what happened.
Great.
She should feel bad.
That doesn't mean I have to be her escort to cotillion.
She's at the tipping point.
She's not Darth Vader yet.
She could still stay Anakin.
We have to stop her before we truly lose her to the dark side.
Fine.
But she'd better really want to do this.
She does.
I promise.
Hey.
I didn't think you were coming in till Monday.
Well, my night suddenly opened up, and I know you said you work late, - so I thought You might be hungry.
Thanks.
I'm starving.
But are you sure? I mean, it's Friday night.
I'll take real politics over the ones at cotillion any night.
Joe Wilson has nothing on Blair Waldorf.
Okay.
So what What is all this? Uh, 1 speech, 15 drafts.
Is there anything your new media relations fact can do to help? Well, the speech is about school lunches, teacher salaries and term limits.
That's all? Here.
Let me see.
Oh, watch out for your tie.
There you go.
Congressman? I'll come back.
Actually You know, I have to finish this.
You You don't want to run anything by me? Why don't you go home? Tomorrow you can meet Brian.
You'll report to him.
Okay.
Thanks for the food.
Yeah.
Hi.
I'm Kira.
I go to Constance with you.
Yeah, sure, I've seen you around.
You have? That's awesome.
Blair Waldorf's your mentor? Who needs Graham Collins when you have her? What do you know about Graham? When Eric told me you wanted to go with him, I called and asked him, and he was totally up for it.
He told me he texted you, but you said - you already had an escort.
What? When? - Today.
Right after you left rehearsal.
Oh, my God.
Did you text Graham Collins that I didn't want him to be my escort? I knew that if you had the chance to go with Graham, - you'd make the wrong choice.
That wasn't your decision to make.
I don't believe this.
Jonathan.
Mentee and mentee's stepbrother/ Escort's boyfriend, Can you please stop embarrassing Me? People are staring.
Eric tried to sabotage me.
I was trying to save you.
I don't know why everybody loves Graham so much.
I went to camp with the guy, and he's a He's a creep.
What? You knew him this whole time? I had a plan from the beginning.
And I should have stuck to it.
I'm going to cotillion with Graham Collins.
I'll allow it.
Sorry, Eric.
Actually, Blair, since I'm queen of Constance and Graham Collins wants to be my escort, I don't think I need you as my mentor anymore.
Jenny, you're lucky to have me.
Don't push it.
Your era's over.
And so is that headband.
So should I call Graham? Now that I know he wants to go with me, - I think I'll call him myself.
Uh-oh, little J.
You've stepped on Eric's toes one too many times.
Whoa.
She can't get away with this.
She won't.
Now he's found a new partner.
Who knows what could happen when these two start to tango? Morning.
Oh.
I see the moving in went well.
Hey, Blair.
Blair.
Excuse the mess.
How was dinner? Did you and Serena work things out? Oh, no.
She took off immediately.
Thank God.
Then I had to relieve her of her mentor duties.
Is that poll artist wearing my Agent Provocateur corset? Just make sure she's careful undoing the eyehooks.
They pinch.
I just came to grab a dress for tonight.
The last time I saw Blair that freakishly calm Was when Serena left for boarding school.
And you know as well as I do, the calm won't last.
And when it breaks, there are going to be pieces of Blair all over the wall.
And I really don't want to clean up that mess.
What are she and Serena fighting about this time? Basically how each one loves the other more than the other loves her.
Can you even fight about that? You might want to ring housekeeping.
Chocolate leaves a stain.
Toodles.
Hey.
I didn't realize you were here.
Yeah, I'm just about to take off.
I was leaving you a note to check out this new press release.
I'm sure it's fine.
Just show it to Brian when he gets back.
Okay.
Did I do something wrong? No, I just I don't have time to chat.
Um, I'm at work, Serena.
But you're you're just acting like - you don't really want me here or something.
That's not it.
Well, what then? - This was a huge mistake.
What was? Hiring me? Tripp, I'm sorry, But you're you're the one who asked me to come in for the interview.
If you didn't want me - working here, then why would you do that? - I did want you here.
I find you smart and charming And I wanted to help you out.
But having you here? I didn't realize how much it would affect me.
Say something.
Um You know what? Don't worry about me.
It's not gonna be a problem.
I have to go.
Serena, wait.
Please.
It's it's fine.
Excuse me.
I don't understand.
How can you make me queen? Simple.
To become queen, you must take down the queen.
But I want to be Jenny's friend.
Kira, let me tell you a story.
I used to have a friend like Jenny.
She was beautiful, fabulous And she let me make all these sacrifices for her.
And you know what I got back in that investment? Zero.
Because girls like her run emotional ponzi schemes.
Serena will never like you the way you like her.
You mean Jenny.
Details.
Now are you ready to be queen, or do I need to find a new frog? We hear Jenny Humphrey has landed Graham Collins as her escort.
Better put on that lip gloss, ladies.
Look like you'll be kissing Jenny Humphrey's ring by the end of the night.
Goodbye, Jenny from Brooklyn.
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Whoo! - On three.
One, two, three! - Whoo! Oh, God.
Mmm.
Ugh.
Ooh! Mm! This is even more amazing than dancing in the fountain.
Mm, mm, mm, mm.
I'll be right back.
Um, don't do any mind-altering substances without me.
Okay.
All right.
You know, I think this is gonna work.
Really? It's gonna yeah, she's gonna what? I knew you were trouble, Humphrey.
You're trying to get Olivia to abandon her calling as Queen of the Undead.
You don't think Morgana could take over Camelot? - Vanessa, d - Sorry.
But Lancelot wouldn't let that happen, would he? If the realm falls into the wrong hands, it's on your head.
He means you can kiss your credit rating good-bye.
Nice v-neck.
Thank you for coming.
That's those are your people.
Shut up.
Who's ready for a keg stand? I have to take the movie.
Even I have to admit This may just be my makeover swan song.
And not to take anything away from your moment, but I'm still not sure anyone's going to think I'm better than Jenny.
They will when they see who your escort is.
But I'm going with Eric.
I mean, he's nice and all, but - Eric's not your escort anymore.
Then who is? - You know Graham Collins, right? - Graham? Spin your partner round and round.
Look like little J is going down.
You know, you don't have to do this if you don't want to.
Oh, well, it's a little late for that.
You look beautiful, Jenny.
I'm just saying, I'll always love you, - with or without society's approval.
Thanks, dad, but honestly, I can't wait to walk down those steps.
So I'll see you soon.
Hey, Jenny.
Have you seen Blair? - Um, no, not yet, fortunately.
I'm looking for my escort, Graham Collins.
He's, uh, sort of this year's, I guess, you.
I'll take that as a compliment.
Hey, have fun tonight.
Thanks.
I plan to.
Always lead with the right.
And no claw hands.
Relaxed fingers.
Oh, look.
A lost boy from lost weekend.
Chuck actually sent me to find you.
He has a surprise in the private lounge upstairs.
Go.
We've got it under control.
Okay.
But I'm just curious.
You never told me how exactly did you get Graham to ditch Jenny for Kira? I told Graham that what happens at Camp Suisse doesn't stay at Camp Suisse.
Little Van Der Woodsen, I'm impressed with your natural talents.
And we were good long distance, You know, with your Sushi pun text flirting and all that.
I know.
It's much easier to be pissy on ichat.
I'm gonna be back next year.
There's too many people depending on me for this one.
I grew up on these sets.
This crew is like my family.
I never thought I'd be sad to hear about "Endless Knights 4.
" When do you have to go? Well, fight choreography starts right away, so, you know, with the midterms over, it makes sense for me to leave for London next week.
So much for the ultimate college experience.
What? No.
I have had the ultimate experience, with you guys.
They say that the friends you meet here last a lifetime.
Do you guys want to get out of here? - Absolutely.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
What are you doing here? Waiting for you.
You sent me a text to meet you, and then you keep me waiting for half an hour? I didn't text you.
I lost my phone.
Nate told me to come meet Chuck.
Right.
Going down.
Not without me.
Can you press the button, please? I've pressed the button.
If you don't believe me, you can press it yourself.
Great.
Hello? I'm trapped in the elevator with someone who sucks all the air out of the room.
Send help or I'll be dead within the hour.
Not until you two work things out.
Bass? Bass? Th this is a punishable offense, and not the kind of punishment you like! I'm only doing what you refused to do yourself.
Chuck, this is not funny.
There's a single Malt and some Laduree Macaroons in the storage box, plenty to sustain you until you two figure things out.
So What did my text supposedly say? That you were sorry and you missed me.
Did you text me back? Miss Jane Cordelia Trapp, escorted by Mr.
Theodore Davis III.
Miss Sawyer Harriett Bennett, escorted by Mr.
Evan Jameson Jr.
Miss Jennifer Tallulah Humphrey, escorted by Mr.
Graham Collins.
My apologies.
Miss Kira Abernathy, escorted by Mr.
Graham Collins.
Who's your escort, dear? What just happened? Um Jenny Humphrey went to a ball.
I don't I don't know.
Jenny Humphrey had a great fall, and none of her minions, mentors or friends want to put Jenny together again.
Jenny, my darling, what happened? - Are you all right? Do you want to pick someone else to walk with? It doesn't work that way, dad.
You only get one chance.
Have you seen Blair? - Uh, no.
Sorry.
I know she's behind this.
And it's all because I didn't want her as my mentor.
What if it's all for the best? I mean, don't you think that maybe being Queen - isn't worth it? - You really don't understand.
I was gonna walk down those steps and finally stop having to prove myself.
Let it go, Jenny.
It's over.
That's what Blair thinks.
Hi.
Are you still here? You went looking for your father? Yeah, and I I found him, too, but he didn't want to see me.
What? Why didn't you say anything while all of this was happening? I guess I was ashamed.
Your dad adores you, all your dads do.
And Rufus would do anything for Dan and Jenny.
Even Nate he may have to go to prison to see his dad, but the Captain would never turn him away.
I'm even jealous of Nate's dad.
Not knowing you is your father's loss.
Maybe, but I I just can't seem to let it go.
I keep leaving him messages and writing letters to addresses I'm not even sure are his.
You miss him.
You're allowed.
I don't want to.
All I even remember of him is him going on trips and then coming back and bringing me presents.
And then one day he didn't come back.
And now it's like I I can't seem to get anything right anymore.
Between Carter and the paparazzi and Brown and Ohh.
And now Tripp.
Tripp Van Der Bilt? Yeah, it I guess I've I've kind of had a crush on him.
But it was nothing.
I mean, he's he's married, and he's always treated me like a kid.
But now we work together, and tonight Did something happen? No.
No, nothing.
Your text saved me.
But now I don't know if I can trust myself around him.
Then you can't see him again.
Carter was one thing, but Tripp is a married congressman.
I know.
Serena - I know.
Promise me you won't see him or speak to him again - without coming to me first.
Okay.
I promise.
Thank you, Blair.
If you two want to kiss, it won't count as cheating.
Creepy, Chuck.
Okay, wait.
So you guys used a prefab college experience - to get me to stay? - Oh, yeah.
Shamelessly plucked from the headlines.
Wait, how many did we eventually get through? I think we got, uh, what let's see.
There's the beer boggle and fountain yoga and, uh You know, I think we got a solid 14 out of 15.
So you can go back to London with your head held high.
What? I am not going with just one more to go.
Now come on.
Let's let's do the last one.
Let's just do it right now.
Mm.
It can't be worse - than the bathroom at Fat Black Pussycat's.
I wouldn't say worse.
Oh.
Yeah.
That one.
Have you ever, uh - Have I? No.
No.
No, never.
Wait no, never.
Have you? - Once.
But it was in a movie, - so that doesn't really count.
Not me.
No.
Let's find Nate and Chuck and congratulate them.
And then torture them.
May I have your attention, Please? Due to extenuating circumstances we have one last deputy to present Miss Jennifer Tallulah Humphrey.
She's walking alone? Nobody walks alone.
Escorted by Mr.
Nathaniel Archibald.
A college guy? Nate Archibald is epic.
Well, we found Nate.
Oh, E, you tried to play dirty at the dance.
but you should know nobody puts Jenny in the corner, and now she's having the time of her life.
So thanks for saving me again.
You know how these girls are.
I'm glad it worked out.
Nate? I gotta say, I didn't see that one coming.
Well, I learned from the best.
Good answer.
The other queens would like to pay their respects.
You look beautiful, Jenny.
Enjoy your night.
Thank you.
So now what? You wanna get something to eat? Yeah, but first I need to stop by Tripp's office - to hand in my resignation.
It's just up the street.
That's my girl.
Thanks for coming.
You won't believe who Jenny got to walk with her.
I read all about it On "Gossip Girl".
But I didn't come here because of Jenny.
Were you serious on your message? Have you really been scheming with Blair? Uh, yeah, I I know it sounds crazy, but So it's official you've sunk to Jenny's level.
I was doing it to help her.
Although it didn't exactly turn out as I planned.
Really? I'm shocked.
The point is, it doesn't matter.
She's not worth our time.
She's not the only one.
I don't want to do this anymore.
Well, we won't.
Like I said, I'm I'm done with Jenny.
I'm not talking about Jenny.
Jonathan, come on.
I promise I'll never talk to her again.
It's not about Jenny.
It's about who you've become.
I liked you because you were different from everyone else.
You were smart and you knew who you were.
You didn't need to prove anything to anyone.
And now? I'm I'm sorry, Eric, but it's over.
You were the one who said to restrict our scheming to outsiders.
Desperate times, desperate measures.
And I'm willing to accept my punishment.
In fact, I left a few props up in the lounge.
Sadly, your punishment is going to be an evening without me.
I'm gonna spend it with my best friend.
Oh, and if you ever loan out my lingerie again Well I just hope you like me in flannel.
Eric.
I thought maybe you bailed.
Did you see it? It was awesome.
I really showed Blair.
She even admitted it herself.
Yeah, you really showed her.
Hey, look, I'm sorry about Jonathan becoming collateral damage.
But you understand, right? I had no choice.
And you did lie to me.
Oh, a bunch of us are going to Serafina.
You wanna come? Go celebrate with your friends.
Hi.
You know, you really put yourself on the radar tonight.
Better not make that mistake again, or you'll pay for real.
She can threaten me all she wants.
I'm not going back to social oblivion.
Don't worry.
Next time we take Jenny down, it'll be for good.
Some people think that when the party ends, the night is over.
But I've found, it's when the music stops and the lights come up that the real trouble begins.
Hi.
I'm glad you came.
I want to apologize.
I shouldn't have said anything.
No, I'm I'm glad you did.
But I don't think it's a good idea for me to work for you anymore.
I actually came here to say that I quit.
I completely understand why you'd want to quit After what I said today.
But don't throw this away, Serena.
You deserve this opportunity.
And I want you there.
For whatever reason, I trust you, And I don't have many people I can say that about in my work or my life.
Yeah, I, uh I feel the same way.
And I promise to never cross that line.
We're both adults.
We'll just agree to keep things friendly and professional.
Okay.
Friendly and professional.
Plus, I still owe you for the injury.
Yeah.
Serena! I mean, Serena, there you are.
May I speak to you alone for a moment, please? Hey, Tripp.
Blair, it's okay.
I'll call you tomorrow.
I'm I'm fine.
I can see that.
I'm sorry.
She's a little did you even I still really don't get how these events work.
One chance, two chances.
Jonathan, Graham, Nate.
Even I can't explain that one.
But I don't think I've seen Jenny this happy - Ahh.
since she was 8 and made her first dress.
Thanks, Lil.
I know the committee didn't make it easy for you to let in a Humphrey from Brooklyn.
Well, what kind of parents would we be if we didn't do what we could to make our children happy? Mmm.
Coming to bed? Mm, yeah, in a minute.
Uh, Vanya said there's something to sign from Bass Industries.
Okay.
Yeah.
Mm.
You better get your beauty rest now, because it looks like things could get ugly in the morning.
XOXO, Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here, your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Someone set Tripp up to make him look like a hero.
You - This couldn't have worked any better.
My husband is a Congressman.
I have a crush on him.
Now I don't know if I can trust myself around him.
Something happened the night of the Shepherd wedding.
We're all aware what happened that night.
I think we got 14 out of 15.
I'm not going with just one more to go.
Gossip Girl - S03E10 "The Last Days Of Disco Stick" As a famed literary liar once told Oprah, memory is subjective.
Top of the morning.
Up top.
Yeah, there it is.
Memories can be embellished or denied.
Hey, Blair.
I don't know what you think you saw between me and Tripp, but nothing is happening.
But as James Frey knows all too well the truth always comes out.
This is my 30th message.
I don't want to fight anymore.
Please call me.
Here comes message 31.
Ugh.
I don't converse with liars or Lewinskys.
Come on.
Blair.
You don't know that you saw anything.
In the second grade, I saw our gym teacher giving Laverne Glazer's mom the glad eye.
Not only did it earn me the first "a++" for gym in Constance history, I learned that my sexual tension radar is unparalleled.
Point ceded.
So is beatnik back? Ew.
No.
I'm adding new recruits to my student army.
Apparently at N.
Y.
U.
, no one cares if your forefathers made pumpkin pie at Plymouth.
They only care if they made profits at Paramount.
Ahh.
The Tisch kids.
Spawn of moguls and movie stars.
Yesterday I sent a first edition "no exit" script to their leader, Paul Hoffman.
Today I'll secure the alliance.
Care to tag along? - Oh, I'd love to, but a high-ranking diplomat has asked me to show his son around New York.
I need to build up my continental clientele, so it looks like I'm statue of liberty-bound.
Oh, the sacrifices we make for success.
I'll think of a way to make your day less boring later.
What, a threesome? - Oh, yeah.
Just me, Olivia, Vanessa two girls, four boobs and one Dan Humphrey.
How awesome am I? - Oh, how stupid can you be? - What? - Buddy, okay, I know things.
II've been to Europe.
Chuck Bass is my best friend.
Yeah.
All right, the third person is supposed to be a stranger.
No, the fact that it was Vanessa is what made it so fun.
Okay, the problem is during a threesome, there's always a twosome and a onesome going on.
You know what? The onesome was not so bad.
Okay, you may have enjoyed the show, but let's face it, Vanessa is very vocal.
It couldn't have been easy for Olivia to hear all that.
No.
You know what? Olivia was fine.
We talked the next morning.
And so is Vanessa.
I mean, I haven't really seen her much, but, uh, I'm I'm sure she is.
Why are you being such a buzzkill? - Because you're lucky to have both of them in your life.
All right? Not only do I not have a girlfriend, ever since Serena and I stopped speaking, I don't even have a girl friend either.
You had both, and you blew it.
I did not.
I did not.
Okay.
Okay.
In fact, you know what? There she is, my still best friend.
Ah, perfect.
Abrams.
Hey, Dan.
I've barely seen you this week.
I feel like you've been avoiding me since No.
No, not at all.
Uh, tonight at the bowery I think Morrissey is playing.
So you want to go, just the two of us, for old times' sake? Yeah, I'd love it.
So I'll see you tonight? - Yeah, of course.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Well, it didn't seem awkward at all.
Everything is it's fine.
It really is.
Give me a call if you need me, which you will.
Gaga's a Tisch alumni.
Even if she doesn't want to give a secret concert at the Bleecker, at least show me the courtesy of writing back.
Are you guys talking about Lady Gaga? No, Blair.
I'm talking about Gaga Ahmadinejad, First Lady of Iran.
That's funny.
You know who likes sarcasm? My stepfather, Cyrus Rose, big-time entertainment lawyer.
Maybe he could talk her into doing a show.
Uh, Blair, we all know who my father is, and this girl here is Willa Weinstein.
If our fathers can't help us, I doubt Cyrus Rose, whom I've never heard of, can.
What are you guys doing for cabaret tonight? Fairy-tale theme is hard.
Don't want to be trite.
Cabaret? I love cabaret and fairy tales.
Princesses, queens - Uh, sorry, Blair.
It's my cabaret, and it's by invitation only.
All the spots are filled by serious theater students.
I don't care how much money they're offering.
K.
C.
, "Bitches of Eastwick" is a terrible idea.
It's like "Heathers," but with witches.
I ever since "E.
K.
4" isn't happening, she's literally pushing me to take anything.
Yeah, well, I thought well, I'd hoped that you'd, uh, you'd stick around now.
Well, that's my plan.
I'm so happy here, You know, with my classes, and I have you.
And Vanessa.
And Vanessa.
And if I want to act, I can do it here at N.
Y.
U.
, - You know, with the best theater department in the whole country.
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, you know, speaking of Tisch, um, tell me if I'm crazy, but I was thinking of applying to the, uh, playwriting program for next year.
Dan, I don't think that's crazy at all.
I would have to write a play by this Christmas break.
Well, I'll help you with your application tonigh I would love that, but, uh, tonight Vanessa and I are gonna go see Morrissey at the bowery.
It's a tradition we've had since seventh grade.
You know, we wear tight shirts, we through gladiolus on stage.
Um, it's okay, right? Yes, of course.
It's tradition.
I'm gonna go grab a coffee, okay? I'll see you later.
Okay, uh I thought we were gonna grab coffee together.
What about Brad Alexander? His mother said he's single.
Uh, yeah, 'cause he gave six girls from Nightingale the gonorrhea of the throat last year.
What are you two doing? Oh, we're trying to find Jenny a date for the horticultural society gala.
Don't worry, dad.
I'm over Upper East Side guys.
I'm looking to expand my horizons.
I'll be just a minute.
Charles, how are you? Can I get you a cup of coffee? Thanks, but I'm on my way to the planetarium.
I was just dropping off those papers you needed.
Thank you.
Did Chuck Bass just say he was going to the planetarium? Mm-Hmm.
I'm entertaining a hotel guest, the son of an ambassador.
He's waiting in the foyer.
Well, maybe jenny could show him around.
You did say you wanted to expand your horizons.
Yeah.
I can do it.
But you owe me.
With pleasure.
What is gonorrhea of the throat? Olivia.
Just the starlet i was hoping to find.
Hi, blair.
Uh, dorota need to use my outlet for your towel warmer again? Actually, i have a question.
How do i win over shallow, superficial actors? Calling them "shallow" and "superficial" didn't work? I'm serious.
they're all doing this cabaret thing tonight.
I wasn't even invited.
not that i have anything to perform.
Well, you're in luck.
i-i was invited.
I guess being a movie star has a certain cache.
I may have read that at the dentist.
More importantly, i am dating a guy who needs an opportunity to write a play.
He'll just need to clear his schedule first.
Hey.
tripp.
Uh, how are you? I was, uh, just leaving you a note about the, uh, "observer" article.
Oh.
great.
I thought you wouldn't be here, which is what it said on your schedule.
Right.
um, my meeting ended early.
Good.
yeah.
Then you'll have time to read my note.
You know, this, um, this really shouldn't be so awkward.
It won't be for too long.
Big move to d.
c.
tomorrow.
I thought that wasn't until january.
Maureen wanted to be there for the holidays-- The parties, the networking.
It's probably for the best, though.
I've been pretty Distracted.
yeah, tell me about it.
Uh, last week Nothing happened.
Then why does it feel like it did? Maybe we should just, uh Avoid each other until you leave.
There you two are.
Honey.
i just found out they had to move the freshman spouses luncheon.
Um, so i'd have to leave in an hour.
is that okay? yeah, of course.
I'll see you tomorrow.
i'll just have jeanne finish packing.
But all that's left is the home office.
Serena should help you.
There's some private family stuff, and i trust you That's not really in serena's job description.
She doesn't mind.
do you? Now who wants to take their favorite wife to brunch? don't forget yourself, congressman.
your marriage could wind up in "a million little pieces.
" Mom, i know how much you love grandfather.
and i get it.
It's not like i haven't forgiven my father a few times.
But do not let him manipulate you.
He was the one behind the hudson thing.
Who else could it be? hello? nate? I'm sorry.
mom? Yeah, i'd love to hear your new information, But, um, listen, i gotta go.
I'll call you later, okay? I know i'm not your favorite person right now, But it's me, nate, and--and there's no one else i can talk to about this.
I, uh I think i may be about to get involved with a married man.
Why am i the only one you can talk to? Because it's tripp.
Vanessa, hey.
Hey.
i figured you'd be back to get some clean clothes at some point.
yeah.
I know, we've barely seen each other.
Dan and i have just been busy, you know? So You're not.
.
Avoiding me because of the whole What? oh, my god.
Uh, no.
i Come on.
No.
Okay, great, because i was totally freaking out before i ran into dan this morning.
But he was the same old dan.
You know, tonight we're going to, like, our fifth morrissey show, And i still have tickets from our first one in seventh grade.
um, actually I feel really bad about that.
Um, a month ago, i signed dan and me up for the bleecker inn cabaret, and it's tonight.
Um, we would totally blow it off, But dan wants to apply to tisch, and it's just really great exposure for him.
oh, yeah.
Okay.
Sorry about morrissey.
I just don't get it.
i mean, tripp? really? Two months ago, you were all over carter baizen.
Tripp has sacrificed so much to get where he is.
I mean, we all have.
he can't just throw it away for you.
Yeah, and he's fighting it, and so am i.
I can literally feel my heart thump when i see him.
I haven't felt this way since i was 13, with jude law in "alfie.
" Yeah, well, you're not 13 anymore, serena.
You know, i thought that, uh, whatever happened between us I could still count on you, But i guess i was wrong.
Hey.
You're right.
i'm sorry.
You can count on me, always.
So, belgium, huh? I bet they have really good waffles.
My family's really into waffles.
yeah, i've barely tasted them.
We left when i was 4 so my father could work on the oslo accord.
he worked on the oslo accord? that sounds major.
Yeah, clearly more major than being a father, but right.
So, uh, what do you want to do? there's the boathouse for lunch, Or we could walk on over to jean georges.
Or we could walk on over to jean georges.
It'll be fun.
Oh, my god.

" sorry i'm late.
Uh, uh, what? What is she doing here? Silly.
i'm the producer, costar and director.
Yeah, it was-- it was her idea, actually.
My brilliant idea.
A musical featuring the songs of tisch alumna lady gaga.
Paul loves his gaga.
I'm gonna go pick his brain about what songs he'd think work best thematically.
Okay.
umWhat's-- what's going on here? You want me to cancel on vanessa, who's gonna be justifiably furious, to--to write a "snow white"/ lady gaga musical to be directed by blair waldorf? listen, i know that her idea is--is kind of out of the box, but if you pull this off, everyone's gonna be talking about it.
And i talked to vanessa.
she's totally cool about tonight.
Wait.
s-so you already told her? I-i ran into her in--in our room, and she was fine.
i promise.
leave a message, and i might listen to it.

You good? - yeah, thanks, man.

Okay, you ready? Serena, hey.
Uh, what do you like on your pizza? Actually, i'm--i'm not coming over.
I had a feeling you'd call.
I can't say i'm not disappointed, though.
Come on, tripp.
You know it's not a good idea for us to be alone all night.
No, you're right.
I don't want to go without saying good-bye.
Could we maybe just get some lunch? Lunch? yeah.

can she come back later? - No, she said it was important.
I thought you had a play to write.
listen, i'm sorry about morrissey, But i told olivia this morning that i wanted to apply to tisch, and so she saw this cabaret thing, and she signed us up.
Wait.
This morning? - Yeah You know, it had nothing to do with our plans tonight.
I mean, this is -- it's a big opportunity for me.
Of course.
Yeah, so, um, I-I'm gonna need your help.
Inspired by miss GaGa's lyrics, I've written a stirical commentary.
About fame, glamour and our society's obsession with the shiny new thing.
Humphrey, I'm surprised.
This isn't horrible.
You play the aging queen, a fading but talented rock star who earned her success.
Olivio, snow white, a young up-and-comer who's trying to steal the queen's thunder - by being outrageous and sexy.
I like it.
Yeah.
Uh, Amalia, Sophie, twins You're the struggling dwarf boy band.
I'll be prince of charming records, trying to find his next big pop star.
so i, you know, I think it, uh, i think it kinda works.
don't get too cocky, humphrey.
We still have your subpar acting to deal with.
Let's meet back here in a half an hour.
Everyone off book so i can block.
actually, i've found a more experienced director More suited to the project.
julie taymor? close.
No.
vanessa? V.
, i am so stupid for not thinking of you earlier.
We're so lucky to have you to bring dan's amazing words to life.
Wait until you read this.
i already did.
dan always shows me early drafts of his work.
Well--well, i mean, i, you know, I had to get her onboard, show her somethin'.
Great.
well, if you need any pointers, I've worked with some of the world's best directors.
sure.
If i want to turn anyone into a bat, i'll--i'll let you know.
Thank you.
Dan? - yeah? When girls live together, Sometimes their cycles sync up.
No hormones-- not yours or theirs-- Will get in the way of my cabaret.
It'll be fine, blair.
What exactly does an upper east side queen do? You wear designer clothes And boss people around? No.
I go to parties and openings and stuff.
Where you wear designer clothes and boss people around? sounds like kind of a yawn.
Well, yeah, I guess compared to being an international drug dealer.
What's the deal with that anyway? I mean, you don't need the money.
Your dad's an ambassador, right? exactly, which means we don't have to go through customs, They don't search our bags when we come in from the hague.
Besides of the added satisfaction of knowing my father would have to suffer if i were ever caught.
A little bit of danger is what makes life worth living, And you had your very first taste today, queen jenny.
It was kind of thrilling.
if you mean that, some friends are gonna meet me a little later to refuel my boat.
You in? High school was so much easier.
yeah, in some ways.
well, i wasn't attracted to married men.
Yeah, but i was.
Well, not-- not men, obviously.
Lady Catherine-- that was my first experience being someone's fake girlfriend.
Who knew i'd do it as a profession? - Well, if it makes you feel any better, you were a great fake girlfriend.
Oh, my god.
You got It's, like, all over your-- No.
No.
No.
No.
It's, like, you got-- No.
It's like just-- Here.
Stop.
You're good.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Oh.
It's, uh, it's Tripp.
Oh, you can't.
But what if it's important? Serena, just give me the phone.
Now you can't talk about him or think about him or see him.
What--What are you gonna do, tie me to a chair until his plane leaves? I'm gonna take you on a bar crawl, and we are getting drunk.
Okay, like, really, really drunk.
Deal? - Deal.
You're the best.
Oh, snow, have this apple martini before your VMA Performance tonight.
I promise it's not poisoned.
Okay, dwarves, that's your cue.
You know, i think the dwarves should be in the front.
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Um, no one's gonna be able to see me.
Yeah, well, this moment really is about the dwarves, right Dan? Yeah, well, i mean, It's called "snow white," so technically it's Of course you would take her side.
What? - Well, he's right.
I'm not standing in the back.
It was just a suggestion.
Boxing me out is one of vanessa's favorite activities.
What did you say? - All right.
Okay, girls, let's calm down, talk rationally.
You're the one who signed up for this cabaret to box me out.
Are you kidding me? You're the one who boxed me out today, with your morrissey plans.
And that night.
What? - What are you talking about? Vanessa, you're in love with Dan, - and everybody here knows it.
It is true.
Olivia, that-- That's crazy.
Come on.
Okay, i don't need to put up with any of this.
I quit.
Oh, no, you don't.
I quit.
What is going on? Did you bozos have a threesome or something? Oh, god.
How stupid can you be? The third person is always supposed to be a stranger.
Blair, look, this is my mess.
I can-- I'm-- I'm gonna go talk to t he girls.
In which order? Hmm? Exactly.
You're gonna have to tech all by yourself.
I have an army to build, a school to take over and girls to blackmail.
Uh-Oh, playwright.
Better whip out your pen.
It looks like this cabaret just became a one-Man show.
Olivia, I'm not asking you to do cabaret for me.
I'm asking you to do it for all the tweens of this world.
My fans don't care if i do cabaret.
But they'll care if they hear their favorite queen of the dead had a Mnage with disgusting Dan Humphrey and his celebutante girlfriend.
Do you really want everyone here to know that alterna-Chick Abrams is literally a star? First i'll text TMZ then Gossip Girl.
Oh, and the town crier in nowheresville, vermont, so your parents find out.
So What's it gonna be? Do you realize we haven't been out drinking alone since, - uh.
Since the shepherd wedding.
Yeah, - the night that everything changed.
Yeah.
Maybe we should get some food and sober up before something happens.
Come on, Nate.
It's been three and a half years.
I can control myself if you can.
Another round, please.
You got it.
Saved by the bell.
Hold on one second.
I'll be, uh, i'll be right back.
Hey.
Nate.
I just found out Grandfather wasn't behind "hudson hero.
" It was maureen.
your mom just told me.
no.
you're kidding me.
i'm so sorry, nate.
i let you take the fall.
what are you--don't worry about me, tripp.
it's you.
what are you gonna do? i don't know.
i can never trust her again.
i don't know if i even want to see her again.
of course, you're angry.
okay, tripp, but she's your wife.
all right? any kind of separation this early in the term could affect your reelection.
reelection is the last thing on my mind right now.
i just need to clear my head.
but you're out.
no, i'm just at the brandy library with a friend.
listen, hang in there, and i'll call you later, okay? was that dan again? Yeah, the guy's got the most complicated love life.
how about that round? now there's the nate i remember.
oh, by the way, eugene, uh, jenny.
jenny, eugene.
hi, nice to meet you.
cool.
see you, boss.
good.
my guy is here.
here here? like he's coming over to the table? where would you suggest we do it? in the alley, with the cops and the cameras? i understand if you want to leave or, you know, go to a-another table.
no.
i'm good.
granny why are your teeth so big? what if they don't show up? they will.
oh, that's the "show must go on" spirit.
we're up next.
i'm gonna go make sure the dwarves are ready.
and i have a little treat for paul i need to set up.
hey.
i'm--i'm glad you decided to come tonight.
well, blair didn't really give me much choice.
look, uh, vanessa and i are just friends.
she has no feelings for me.
i'm positive.
in fact, i made the same mistake when you went to japan.
so, you know, whatever you think you saw during our--our thing, - uh, it wasn't from her.
yeah, no.
you're right.
right.
see? i told you.
it wasn't from her.
it was from you.
i sat up to take my shirt off.
i look over, and you were looking at vanessa like you've never looked at me.
and then you kissed her, like - like you've never kissed me.
no.
that's that little thing? that was hardly even a kiss.
that you even know what i'm talking about proves that it happened.
if you just let yourself, you'll see that your feelings for her are real and you should stop kidding yourself.
hey, prince charming.
looks like it's time for you to look in the enchanted mirror.
platinum record on the wall, who's the most talented of us all? though your voice is as clear as day, your dance moves are quite pass? And Snow White's youth and s*x appeal means she'll get the record deal.
* She's Pitch * SHE'S TONE-DEAF SHE'S TONE-DEAF * i am bitchy.
* My, what talent you small people have.
If only there were a vampy young vixen to front you, we'd all be swimming in online sales.
Luckily I happen to be dating one.
* I wanna kiss you * * But if I do, then I might miss you, babe * * It's complicated and stupid * * Got my ass squeezed by sexy cupid * * Guess he wants to play, wants to play * * A love game, a love game * * A love game, a love game, a love game * * A love game, a love game, a love game * So you guys met at boarding school? That's cool.
What? Right.
Yeah, eighth grade, Le Rosey.
Good times.
Yeah.
Um, it was nice to meet you.
I'm gonna use the ladies room.
No, no, no.
Hey, sit down.
Don't go empty-handed.
Here.
Just, uh, test the product, yeah? That won't be necessary.
Ch Chuck, what are you doing here? After I got your message, I had housekeeping do an early turndown service on Damien's room.
That's where they found his stash.
I've had my own experience in the boat pond.
I'm taking you home.
You and your father have until noon to collect your luggage.
After that, it's in the river.
Chuck, you're totally overreacting.
I'm really fine.
Dude, the lady said she's fine.
Dude I'm Chuck Bass.
Even Europeans must know what that means.
Well, now that i've added a disco-electro pop beat to Snow White's love ballad and put your voices through auto-tune, It's time to take over the land.
Let's have some fun.
This beat is sick.
* I wanna take a ride on your disco stick * That's her cue.
Where the hell is she? I have no idea.
* I wanna take a ride on your disco stick * Well well, y you know what? The disco stick tends to be an unreliable form of transportation.
It, uh, it breaks down a lot.
What what are you doing? - Get in.
Yes.
Oh Prince, here I am Snow White.
Oh.
And I and I got plastic surgery and colored my hair, like you suggested.
Oh, right.
Right.
Well, you look fantastic.
You know, it took me a long time to get over what happened with us that night.
I actually, uh Well two years ago at the masquerade ball, I tried to tell you I loved you.
It turns out I told Jenny Humphrey.
She was wearing your mask.
You you loved me? Of course I did.
Serena, you're the most beautiful, amazing, alive person I've ever known.
Nate.
I hope I'm not interrupting something.
Platinum record on the wall, it's me now who have it all.
Just as long as true love's kiss doesn't wake this coked-up miss.
Oh, if only the prince would kiss her we could be international backup dancers on her world tour.
There he is now! Yes.
You have to kiss her.
Kiss her! What are you doing? Uh Snow White is alive! So Snow White lives.
But are Dan and Olivia dead? Blair, it was amazing.
You surprised us all.
Speaking of which, I have a surprise for all of you.
And, uh, Dan, if you ever think of applying to the playwriting program, let me know if you want me to read your sample, give some notes.
Oh, wow.
Oh, thank you so much.
Yeah, I'm gonna take you up on that offer.
Everyone, follow me.
So maureen, uh wow.
I, um, I can't believe she did that.
I called her.
She admitted it.
You okay? Not really.
My wife isn't who I thought she was, and neither's my marriage.
Nate, thanks for hearing me out earlier.
You're a great friend.
Yeah, well any time.
Wait.
Nate, you knew? Why didn't you say anything to me? - I - Look, Serena, I don't know anything anymore.
I just know I don't want to be alone.
Could we take a walk? Yeah.
Hey, wait.
Serena, I didn't tell you about Maureen because Tripp's a married man.
If you go with him now, you're gonna cross the line.
Thank you for everything, Nate, really, but that line just got a little blurry.
I don't get it.
What is all this? You may never have heard of Cyrus Rose before, but Lady Gaga certainly has.
Back when she was still at Tisch, they used to play cards together.
Who do you think "Poker Face" is about? That's why she's letting us see her dress rehearsal.
Hey, Olivia.
Whwhere have you been? You kind of abandoned me out there.
I know.
Sorry.
I knew Vanessa would step in, And I needed you to kiss her.
Yeah, which I did, because I had to for the play.
I mean, you you made me do it.
You can't be mad.
You can't judge what happened if you didn't see it.
I didn't need to.
You were the one that needed to kiss her again, to realize for yourself that your feelings for her are real.
Anyway, uh, I just got off the phone with K.
C.
, and she kinda convinced me to take that witch movie.
What? Olivia, you can't you can't leave like this.
I read the script.
It's actually pretty good.
I'll be back in the fall.
There you are.
Look we're gonna have to talk about it.
We saw each other naked, and there's no going back.
But we're friends.
So, Olivia, I apologize for how I acted during rehearsal.
But I don't like Dan like that, and I haven't in years.
rs.
Right? Yeah.
Yeah, she's right.
And, you know, - Hey, Vanessa.
I think Paul Hoffman kinda likes me.
Look, I get the whole "Sullen teenager pushing an envelope" thing.
I've pushed a pack.
But you're better than that Damien guy.
Look, I may be queen, but I'm more lonely and bored than I was when I lived in Brooklyn.
And being with him is exciting.
And dangerous.
Please.
It takes one to know one.
I saw that look in your eye the very first day you came on my radar.
And what so-called look would that be? Be very careful, Jennifer Humphrey.
If you go down the rabbit hole, it's going to take moreit's going to take more than Blair Waldorf and your army of minions to drag you back out.
So what, you're gonna walk me to my room and make sure I don't get into any trouble? Just try not to run into any euro dealers in the kitchen.
Are you okay? Sometimes it's after the curtains closethat the real reckonings come.
Message sent Whether it's about who we wish we were or who we wish we could be or who we want.
I loved you.
You loved me ? I hope i'm not interrupting.
We are so hard on you Because we want you to challenge yourself, to be your own person.
(Blair) how exactly did you get graham to ditch jenny for kira? I told graham that what happens at camp suisse Doesn't stay at camp suisse.
It's about who you've become.
I liked you because you were different from everyone else.
I'm sorry, eric, but it's over.
(Olivia) you were looking at vanessa Like you've never looked at me.
You were the one that needed To kiss her again, to realize for yourself That your feelings for her are real.
My wife isn't who i thought she was And neither is my marriage.
I don't know anything anymore.
I just know i don't want to be alone.
(Blair) you went looking for your father? Yeah, and i-I found him, too, but he didn't want to see me.
And who am i? That's a secret i'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, gossip girl.
Thanksgiving began when the pilgrims and indians Came together to share the bountiful harvest.
Okay, i've got the stuffing.
And, jenny, you have the sweet potatoes, as usual.
Eric, what's your tradition? I, um, don't think we van der woodsens Have any thanksgiving traditions.
Serena apologizes, but she won't be able to make it tomorrow.
I stand corrected.
She has to work on thanksgiving? Well, tripp has his staff Volunteering at a soup kitchen, And with scott and his parents at the cape, And my mother still unable to travel, It looks like it's just going to be us and daniel.
Would you mind if i just walked down to grace's And ordered one of their turkey dinners So we don't have to cook? Um, actually, lily, dad was just-- Thinking the same thing.
Keep it small, hassle-Free.
(Whispers) thank you.
Sorry, rufus, but you can't really blame her.
Our thanksgivings tend to end with french fries at a diner And someone having been in a mental institution.
Yeah, but why don't we show her that this thanksgiving's gonna be different? Well, there's nothing we can do about serena, But i can set up a video chat on my netbook And give grandma a place at the table.
A cece you can unplug.
That's perfect.
Let's go give it a test run.
Hey, why don't you invite jonathan? Jonathan and i aren't really happening anymore.
What? Since when? A while now.
Well, what happened? Let's not talk about it.
On the upper east side, that tradition is upheld With a bountiful harvest of secrets, lies and scandal.
(Man) ?Ooh ? (Chimes) ?Ooh ? Good afternoon, congressman.
I have the press schedule you asked for.
(Lowers voice) so did you talk to maureen yet? Last night.
She wasn't too happy about it, But she agreed to the divorce.
Maureen's coming into town so our people Can write a joint statement explaining the split.
Of course the public won't get the real reason.
And the real reason is? I'm sorry.
I just need to hear That you're not leaving her because of me.
Maureen orchestrated a fraud to win the election.
If you walked away right now, my decision wouldn't change.
But I hope you won't.
I have to.
You're married, and as long as you are, we can't do this.
Serena.
Could our self-Imposed exile start after tomorrow? I can't bear the thought of spending thanksgiving alone.
Well, i had a feeling you might say that, So i already told my mom That you're making me work at the soup kitchen all day.
But this means pay-Per-View movies And room service at my hotel, And that's it.
I'll be good.
You haven't mentioned serena once.
Well, for much of that time, i was asleep, But since you're asking, I've decided i'm putting her out of my mind.
Besides, i have a far more cunning and deceptive adversary To deal with.
When does your mother land again? to escort me back? How dumb does she think i am? She has some bomb She wants to drop on me in a controlled environment, Surrounded by air marshals and french people.
Amazing.
Your holiday paranoia truly knows no bounds.
Precedence is not paranoia.
When i called daddy last night And started asking him questions, He clammed up faster than rihanna.
I need to find out my mother's secret Before boarding that plane.
Oh, i didn't know the empire Had hourly rates.
One van der bilt isn't enough? I'm not having an affair with tripp, And since you're gonna find out anyway, He's leaving his wife, and it's not for me.
Then what are you, exactly, An 18-Year-Old, blonde coincidence? Call me in six months, when he meets his next "coincidence," That is, if he even leaves his wife, which i highly doubt.
(Nate) i told you it would end badly.
Threesomes, man-- Don't believe the hype.
Yeah, but here's the thing-- Olivia said she was leaving Because she thought that i-I had feelings for vanessa.
Do you? H-How--How would i even know? How'd olivia know? Well, she--She said she saw a look on my face.
Wait.
You mean you mean during? (Laughs) oh, if this is not your next story for "the new yorker," I'm sending it out to an entirely different magazine.
Oh, thank you.
That really helps.
Oh, relax.
Chances are you're right.
It's just the threesome talking.
Exactly.
Yes.
Say-- Say more things like that.
Because i mean, this is-- This is just a phase.
Okay.
All right.
This is good.
So you around for thanksgiving? Uh, no, actually.
I, um I've been going through some--Some mixed feelings For someone as well, so i called my grandfather, And i think i'm gonna head out to the estate And try and patch things up.
All right, well, tell him i said hello, And that thanks to last year's the longest yard, My knee can now predict the weather.
(Elevator bell dings) Will do, man.
Peace.
Hey.
Wanna go for a walk? Hi.
Sorry.
I got in a huge fight with my mom, And i didn't sign the form to stay in the dorm over break.
So could i crash with you for a while? What's with the face? Oh.
No.
(Laughs) what? No, this is my, um, my surprised, happy face.
Uh, make yourself at home.
Lily told us you still weren't well enough to travel, So we thought video chat would, uh, be a great way To have you at thanksgiving tomorrow.
I'm fine.
Lily told me you weren't doing anything for thanksgiving.
Well, i-I mean we're not doing anything major, But, uh, i'm sure after everything you've been through, She--She didn't want to make you feel obligated.
(Gasps) oh.
Oh, how, um, how thoughtful.
I'd love to be there in person.
But let's keep it as a surprise, shall we? (Singsong voice) see you soon.
(Beep) (Cell phone ringing) (Elevator bell dings) (Ring) "Hello" is the word you're looking for.
I am sorry, miss blair.
(Beep) i not talking with vanya, And now he not stop calling and texting And tweeting and writing on wall.
Lionel tribbey? That's my mother's estate attorney.
"Please approve all changes and return immediately.
" She's changing her will.
I knew there was a secret.
(Elevator bell ding, doors open) Darling, i'm home! Mother! (Clicks teeth) Is that for me? Yes.
Mm.
Why don't we open it now? No, tea first.
I have the most amazing lapsang souchong From mariage frres.
(Nate) come on, serena.
You go off with tripp after leaving me in a bar, And then i hear through the van der bilt grapevine That tripp's asking maureen for a divorce.
You expect me to believe that nothing happened? It was one kiss, And it was a huge mistake that i don't intend on repeating.
I promise.
Fine.
(Cell phone rings) (Ring) Can i call you back? I have to cancel on tomorrow.
Maureen was a mess when she got here.
She kept asking if something else was going on.
She wants to have thanksgiving together.
I have to go.
(Snaps cell phone shut) Sorry.
Hey, do you have plans for thanksgiving? I know it's last minute.
No, i don't, actually.

  Well, how about 3
0 at my mom's? And please bring something stronger than rufus' cider.
(Laughs) (Laughs) Oh.
Oh, nice coat.
Oh, you, too.
Oh, my god.
Maureen.
Lily.
Oh, i am so glad to see you.
How is d.
C.
? So much to get ready, But tripp insisted we spend the holidays here.
Speaking of, i'd love to know why he has my daughter Working on thanksgiving.
She said she's volunteering at a soup kitchen with him.
I've never seen her work these kinds of hours.
Is it always like this with him? No.
His schedule's been Especially busy these past few weeks.
This is probably an overstep, But do you think you could convince him To spend part of your thanksgiving with us, You know, force my daughter to have a little family time? Uh-Oh.
Looks like someone's "small" thanksgiving Might just have a big problem.
Yes.
Yes, we'd--We'd love to come.
Great.
May the lord make us truly thankful For what we are about to receive.
Then she starts lecturing the poor cashier That thanksgiving is nothing more Than a corporate agenda of the food industry Masquerading as family sentiment.
Oh, you know what? That reminds me.
Um, if my dad asks, We followed the homemade recipe for his pie crust to the letter.
Sorry for unloading.
I just haven't had anyone to vent to Since olivia left.
Have you talked to her Since she went to do "bitches of eastwick"? Uh, no.
Hey, everything happens for a reason, right? Yeah.
Yeah, apparently.
There it is again.
That face.
What? Oh, come on.
There's, uh, there's no--There's no face.
What is going on? You've been quiet ever since i got here.
(Knock on door) Who's that? Don't--Don't hate me for this.
I'm here.
I won't hate you, 'cause you'll be dead.
Don't be mad at dan.
He was just trying to help.
Look, i know i don't do holidays well, But if you give me another chance, I promise i can make it up to you.
I called rufus on the way over here, And he said we're more than welcome to join him.
What? We can have the thanksgiving that you want.
What do you say? Fine Great.
Thank you.
Make yourself at home.
I'll give her one last shot.
If it doesn't work, consider me moved in for the holidays.
(Elevator bell dings) Tripp, what are you doing here? You wouldn't return my calls.
So you're stalking me now? Yes, serena, i'm stalking you.
I thought our relationship wasn't complicated enough, So And get this-- Lily ran into maureen And invited us for thanksgiving, So it looks like We'll be spending tomorrow together after all.
What? Tripp, won't that be weird? It doesn't have to be.
And besides, now we get to spend some time together.
(The raveonettes' "last dance" playing) That's all i care about-- Even with everyone else around-- To be near you one last time.
?I rush to intensive care ? Why does this have to be so hard? (Elevator bell dings) We're almost to your floor.
You want me to come in? Yes, which is why you can't.
?If this is the last dance, i wanna know ? ?I wanna know ? But then again, these elevators can take forever.
? ?Baby ? (Laughs) cyrus, enough.
Yes, enough.
I will.
I will tell her.
I will.
All right.
Good-Bye.
Cyrus says that he misses you and loves you.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
(Elevator bell dings) Sorry.
I had to run out before store closes.
I bring babka and make decaf.
You have to be up early for flight.
No babka, dorota.
I have to turn in now.
It's 3:00 in the morning for me.
I should sleep early, too.
I agreed to work at miss lily's tomorrow.
Big thanksgiving for them, all the sudden, But she offer me time and a half, so Good night, dear.
Wait! I have a wonderful idea.
Why don't we spend thanksgiving with lily and serena? What are you talking about? You know how much i love thanksgiving, The parade on tv.
I'm 19.
Childhood memories are slipping away already.
Well, let me at least call lily, See if it's all right.
I am not getting on that plane until i know my mother's secret, And her secret is in that envelope.
What are you clutching? Uh, miss eleanor asked me to pick up some things for paris.
It's private.
You know what isn't? The i.
N.
S.
Tip line.
Oh, my god.
That's why she's changing her will? My mother's pregnant.
Gratulacje.
Hey.
Yo.
I just came from a meeting with hotel security.
Elevator cameras caught a hotel guest Pulling the emergency stop To have a make-Out session with her boyfriend.
(Chuckles) you just love your job, don't you? It was serena and tripp.
Well I guess he's not leaving maureen over "hudson hero.
" Though i bet that's what he's telling serena.
It's less messy that way, when he bolts in six months.
Come on.
How often does the other woman get a "happily ever after"? Someone needs to get through to her before it's too late.
You know serena.
Whoever tries better bring a sledgehammer.
?Cool yourself, you are flush red ? Oh, dorota.
Happy thanksgiving.
When did you sneak in? I took service elevator.
Oh, you don't have to do that.
Vanya's on duty.
I'm sure he'd love to see you.
Mother.
Surprise.
(Eric) surprise! Hello, lily.
This is the mystery guest? Well, when rufus called And found out that i was feeling well enough to travel, We thought we'd surprise you.
How wonderful.
Opening the door is his job, mom.
That's why he's called the doorman.
It's not derogatory.
Rufus, thank you again so much for inviting us.
Uh, cece, this is gabriela abrams And her daughter vanessa.
This is cece, lily's mom.
Lovely to see you.
Hello, daniel.
You're looking well, cece.
I am, aren't i? This table is exquisite.
Well, lily, it looks like we, um, have a lot to talk about, As do you and rufus.
What's the matter, mother? Is the smoked salmon making you nauseous? No.
No, i'm just a little jet-Lagged.
That's all.
Oh, charles, brut ros? It's my favorite.
That's what blair said when she suggested i pick it up.
Yes, mother, you simply must have some tonight.
I'm not in the champagne mood.
But you love champagne.
I didn't say i didn't love it.
I said i'm not in the mood.
(Elevator bell dings) Happy thanksgiving.
You, too.
I was just telling tripp What a pleasant surprise it was when i ran into lily.
We're really appreciate the invitation.
Yes, especially since you and tripp Have been working all those long hours.
Serena's been a great help.
You must be so proud.
He has such a strong work ethic.
Yes.
That's him.
So where should i put my coat? Here.
Let me take that.
Thank you.
Um There's nate.
I should say hello.
The hardest part's over.
We'll get through this.
Okay? (Elevator bell dings, doors open) Serena, my dear, happy thanksgiving.
Thank you.
I didn't know you guys were coming, either of you.
Surprise.
Isn't this just the best holiday? Hello, congressman.
Where's your lovely wife? Is it me or is my daughter just getting crazier and crazier? Hmm.
A little thanksgiving proclamation-- You two ever play grab ass in my elevator again, And serena will be staying at an airport marriott.
Happy holidays.
Hi.
Hi.
Are tripp and serena having an affair? Nate, please.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I just want him back.
I'm sorry, maureen.
But i think i have a way we can end it quickly and quietly.
I don't know if you want to see this.
If it will end it i do.
(Sighs) Where are you dragging me? Haven't you ever heard of a whispered aside? What did eric do at cotillion? What do you mean? I mean i invited jonathan for thanksgiving, And he texted me back, saying he was surprised That eric and i were still even friends after that night.
Please.
You, of all people, respect a well-Thought-Out sabotage.
Although you came through unscathed, Eric's plan was solid.
Eric's plan? Stealing your escort, leaving you stranded At the top of the stairs-- It was all his idea.
By the way, how do you find having a sibling, Someone whose sole purpose on earth is To compete for your parents' love and attention? (Rufus) uh, if everyone could please find their seats (Jason derulo and imogen heap) ?Mm, whatcha say? ? ?Mm, that you only meant well? ? ?Well, of course you did ? ?Mm, whatcha say? ? I am so happy we are sitting next to each other, rufus.
Excuse me.
Cece, tell me everything about rufus and lily's wedding.
I was boycotting the floral industry, Or i would have been there myself.
Tragically, i wasn't invited.
Apparently my son-In-Law felt it better if i didn't attend.
Mom, it's none of your business.
You--You didn't want lily's own mother at your wedding? Fifth wedding.
But still.
Lily told me you were still too sick to travel.
Thank you, but, i mean, I've been in remission since the middle of august.
But lily didn't come home till october.
?When the roof caved in and the truth came out ? Oh.
Perhaps i'm--I'm--I'm wrong.
It's hard to keep track.
(Laughs) wine? ?We'll be living so large ? ?I'll do anything for you ? ?So tell me, girl ? ?Mm, whatcha say? ? (Lowered voice) why does my mom have to stick her nose Into everyone's business? Oh, come on.
Cece's heart pumps secrets and gin.
It's not--It's not your mom's fault.
You've been defending her all day and ignoring me.
What's going on with you? And you're making that face again.
No.
All right, look, this is getting ridiculous.
(Vanessa) jenny, have you ever heard of someone Starting to make a brand-New face at 19? I don't know.
Ask eric.
He's mastered 2.
Excuse me? Blair told me you were responsible For sabotaging me at cotillion.
What, you don't have anything to say to me? Your sweet potatoes are bland.
?Mm, whatcha say? ? ?Mm, that you only meant well? Well, of course you did ? ?Mm, whatcha say? ? ?Whatcha say? Whatcha say? ? ?Mm, that it's all for the best ? ?Because it is ? ?Mm, what you say? ? ?Mm, that you only meant well? ? Mother, here's some camembert from artisanal.
It's unpasteurized.
Don't you want some? That's enough.
What has gotten into you? Into me? Try you.
You're the one who's pregnant.
?Knowing that i let our love go ? (Glass clinks) Lily and i would like to thank you all For coming to our first thanksgiving as a family.
Now before she gets back, i'd like to tell you a joke That i tell every year, which lily has expressly forbidden.
A group of pilgrims decide to start a band How can you two sit there, smiling? After several of the prominent elders don't you have any sense of decency? Maureen-- No, not one second more.
(Rufus) the young pilgrim says, "can i try?" Tripp and i are going to grow old together, Without you.
Or i make my own statement.
Where did you get that? (Sighs) (rufus) blow them all away, in a--In a style He'll be a political joke, and you'll be a punch line.
Your affair ends now.
When he's done, one of the older pilgrims says serena.
And he says, "that's what i call plymouth rock!" ?'Cause things ain't right ? ?'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out ? ?I just didn't know what to do ? ?I just didn't know what to do ? ?But when i become a star, we'll be living so large ? You know what? Why don't we just eat? I lost my appetite.
?Baby, whatcha say? ? ?Mm, whatcha say? ? And i want pie.
?Mm, that you only meant well? ? ?Well, of course you did, mm, whatcha say? ? Kids.
Oh, and what makes you an expert? ?Mm, whatcha say? ? ?Mm, that you only meant well? Well, of course you did ? I'm so glad you invited me, rufus.
Cheers.
?What--What--What-- What did you say? ? Mom, i can explain.
It's not what it looks like.
So you're not having an affair with a married man? No, i'm--I'm--I'm not having an affair.
I saw you kissing him, serena.
A kiss that we didn't even have Until after he decided to leave his wife.
Do you know what it feels like to be left? Because i do.
Well, it isn't like it was with you.
Tripp actually cares about me.
Oh, you think so? Well, why don't you take a look at what he's doing? Leaving someone who, up until today, Thought the exact same thing.
Walk away, serena.
Until you do, you're not welcome in this home.
So i don't get it.
You hate me, But you've been pretending to be my friend this entire time? That's pretty much it, yeah.
Why wouldn't you just tell me you were mad? At least then we could fight about it.
No, you lost any rights to honesty When you chose being queen over our friendship.
That's not what happened.
Every time you did something bad, I defended you to jonathan.
He got sick of me Making excuses for you all the time, So i decided to try to beat you at your own game.
That was a mistake.
I figured if i could take you down just once, So you could know how it feels to be the one getting egged, Then maybe you'd realize what you'd become, And everything could go back to the way it was.
And you lost jonathan because of it.
I lost everything.
Not me.
Not if you apologize.
You say that now, But you've bec ome a totally different person, And as a result, so have i.
Apparently i became someone That jonathan no longer wanted to be with, And for that, i blame you.
You told kira she had to watch her back.
Well, now you have to watch yours.
There you are.
Mother, how could you? No offense to cyrus, But do you think the world really needs another aaron rose? Blair, you are completely off base.
Thanksgiving always has secrets.
And in your case, it's a miracle.
I am not pregnant.
I did come back to change my will to reflect my new property.
Cyrus and i are moving to paris full time.
But you love new york.
You always said anyone who lives anywhere else Is fooling themselves.
Perhaps it's time for me to step back And let you make manhattan your own.
Besides, cyrus and i did find a lovely penthouse flat On the ile st.
-Louis, Right across from your favorite restaurant.
Rtisserie du beaujolais? Mm.
Oh, that poulet rti is reason enough to move.
(Laughs) Mother I'm sorry For being so crazy.
You pregnant? I mean, come on.
We both know you closed for business a long time ago.
But then whose test was it? Test? Miss waldorfs I know dorota's upstairs.
She won't return my calls.
Please, tell her whatever i did, i am sorry.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
I'll be honest.
This isn't the thanksgiving i had hoped for.
Look, i don't--I don't mean to be presumptuous, But don't you think it's a little odd That lily didn't tell you the truth About when her mother went into remission? I trust lily.
When she's ready to explain, she will.
Yes.
Yes, but-- You know, i think i need more whipped cream.
What is wrong with you? I care about rufus.
I was being honest.
Just like you being honest when i laid out my entire paycheck To get us tickets to see "hair," and you told me You'd rather spend the whole show talking to a homeless man? He was a vet.
This is who i am.
I care about people.
You know, um, it's thanksgiving.
Yeah.
I'm starting to think this was a mistake.
Maybe i should go.
For once, mom, i agree.
Gabriela--Mm.
I'm sorry.
I could only imagine what you're feeling.
What we did-- What i did was wrong.
I never meant to hurt anyone, And--And i hurt you.
I promise i'll never see tripp again.
What are you doing in here? I wanted to go to my room, But then i forgot it's not my room anymore.
What do you want? Chuck told me what happened.
You did the right thing.
Then why do i feel so bad? Doing the right thing takes courage and strength.
At least, that's what i've heard.
(Chuckles) And anything that hard is only made more difficult By not having your best friend by your side.
I'm sorry you had to go through it alone.
I'm sorry, too, For everything.
What are you doing this weekend? Eating leftovers and feeling horrible.
No, you're coming to paris.
What? I am? My mom and i are catching the red-Eye tonight.
If you're gonna be sad, you might as well be sad in paris.
Chuck can shop for sweaters with harold and roman, And we can wander notre dame, and spend time, Just the two of us, like we haven't for so long.
Is your passport here? In the safe upstairs.
(Laughs) then you're ready to go! Come on.
Allons-Y.
(Laughs) Oh.
I'm sorry.
I missed thanksgiving.
There's still dessert.
You're wonderful.
Why did you stay with cece after she got better Instead of coming home to me? Well, um, my mother and i were finally connecting.
I think, faced with her illness, She--She became a different person.
She was loving and kind.
And i wanted to stay and enjoy this person For as long as i could.
You could have told me that.
I know, and i should have, but i I knew it wa Leaving you here, in charge of the kids and everything, And, um, so i lied.
And then i just continued to lie to cover it up.
So that's it then? You love me so much you couldn't let me go? Well, you weren't supposed to hear that, mother.
I'm glad i did.
I now have a witness If she ever tries to tell me how insufferable i am.
I'm gonna go clear the table.
(Sighs) Thank you, mother.
So i take it you didn't tell him About your little trip this summer? No, and i'd like to keep it that way.
When will you learn, my love, That some secrets can't stay hidden? Well, this one will.
Let's hope so.
(Gasps) no, no, no.
I-I eat later.
This isn't for you.
It's for vanya.
Tom colicchio live in building.
I'm sure he sent plate already.
Mr.
Rufus good cook, but not top chef.
Hmm.
This plate is the plate he wants.
Oh.
You are going to have to talk to him eventually.
Not for two or three months at least.
Dorota-- You not understand.
We not married.
My parents start next polish-Soviet war.
Russia once again not victor, believe me.
Good luck.
Good luck.
I-I don't want to do this! Well, i guess it's a good thing you travel light.
Look, i-I appreciate your concern, dan.
I do, but it's a waste of time.
We're--We're too far apart.
Well, y-You're not as different as you think.
Did you know she petitioned to keep a historic bar From closing in brooklyn last year? And she spent the end of the summer Rebuilding community gardens in alphabet city.
She loves you.
She does.
I think she just wishes You'd spend half the time on her That you do on these people you don't even know.
And when you do, trust me, i-I really think you'll see How, uh, how amazing she is.
I-I-I-I can't believe i didn't see this till now.
Mm, what? Oh, you're in love with her.
It's all over your face.
No.
(Laughs) No.
That's, um Yeah.
I'll, uh, i'll let you guys be alone.
I can't believe what you did.
You had a choice, tripp.
Seems like you made it.
What do you mean? Now thanks to you, maureen can cause a huge scandal.
I lose everything.
No, you lose your career.
Tripp, you've already lost serena.
The fact that this is just now occurring to you Makes me pretty sure i did the right thing.
Why didn't you tell him the truth? That is the truth.
Okay, serena deserves Someone who would sacrifice anything to be with her.
Even if that means stealing a security tape From his best friend's business? Tell her how you feel.
Give her a chance To be with a guy who does deserve her.
(Strums note) Gibson guitar, Vinyl collection I guess this really isn't bart's office anymore.
(Beep) yeah, except i'm sure my mom Hasn't given rufus the combo to the safe yet.
(Beep) Well, now that bart's not around to keep files on everybody, Maybe you guys don't need one.
What are you still doing here? I couldn't leave.
I could help you out with that.
The elevator comes, You get on it, and we never see you again.
I don't care if maureen outs our affair.
I don't care if they run me out of congress for it.
All i care about is you.
If i'm gonna leave maureen, Which i just told her i am I want to do it with you by my side.
I'm gonna be downstairs, waiting in my car, to go.
I hope you'll join me.
Wow.
I didn't think he had it in him.
What do i do? Go.
I love you.
I love you, too.
What is that? It's from my father.
It's postmarked from weeks ago, and it's been opened.
(Eleanor) blair, we have to go.
(Whispers) go.
It's okay.
I need to be alone.
Where are you going? Tripp and his wife have left, And you, um, you did the right thing.
Actually, tripp is divorcing maureen.
He's waiting for me downstairs.
We're going away together.
I thought we understood each other, serena.
We do.
I'm not welcome in your home, so You're still responsible for breaking up his marriage.
Don't go through with this.
It is a huge mistake, One that you will regret for the rest of your life.
You want to talk to me about mistakes? You don't get to judge me Ever again.
After the yelling died down, i thought i'd take a chance You might be ready for some pie and coffee.
Well, my daughter and i had Our first hear-To-Heart talk in--In ever.
(Laughs) and thank you.
Of course.
It's all because of you.
But don't worry.
We're gonna move to a hotel for the rest of the weekend.
Oh, you--You don't have to leave.
I mean, you're welcome to stay, uh, as long as you like.
Okay.
About what i said before-- You gave me some great advice.
I'm going to return the favor.
When vanessa told you her feelings all those years ago, You broke her heart, And your friendship almost didn't recover.
So unless you're sure That my daughter is who you want to be with, I suggest you keep your feelings to yourself.
Because if you break her heart this time, Your friendship won't survive.
And that would be a tragedy, Because you are a great friend for her.
Thank you.
Hey, mom.
Paul hoffman, that guy that i told you about-- He just texted me, and his parents are in town.
He wants to meet for a drink.
Do you want to go? I don't know.
Dan, do i? Uh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
I--She likes him a lot.
I think you should meet him.
Great.
All right.
Let's do it.
Yay! (Horn honks) Serena! Excuse me if i didn't say good-Bye, But after what you did-- Don't go.
What? Don't go with tripp.
Nate.
Okay, i know what i did was wrong, And i'm sorry.
I just--I did it because 'Cause ever since last week, Ever since three years ago when you left Please don't get in the car.
Just stay here with me.
Just give me a chance.
Serena.
You coming? (Paramore's "the only exception" playing) You'll come visit us in vermont? I will.
Thanks for everything.
Another thanksgiving has come and gone You know what? I like your new face.
(Chuckles) (Chuckles) it's cute.
And what am im most thankful for? The truth.
Sometimes it's the truth you've been trying not to face Or the truth that will change your life ?And we've got to find other ways ? ?To make it alone ? ?Keep a straight face ? ?And i've always lived like this ? ?Keeping a comfortable ? Sometimes it's the truth that's a long time coming ?And up until now i had sworn to myself ? ?That i'm content ? Or the truth you prayed would never see the light of day.
Lil? Lily, have you seen the other wedding album? I want to show cece the pictures Of me jamming with kim and thurston.
Oh.
Um You okay? Oh, yes, everything's fine.
Um, i'll grab it.
?You are the only exception ? Hey, do you mind if i stay? Yes.
But that's why i love you.
(Sighs) Come on.
Let's go get drunk.
Some truths may not be heard the way we hoped they would.
(Speaks indistinctly) But they linger long after they've been said.
?Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream ? ?Oh ? ?You are the only exception ? ?You are the only exception ? Oh, i didn't see you, miss van der bilt.
Sorry, dorota.
I forgot my coat.
It's been kind of a crazy night.
Please tell lily and rufus everything was wonderful.
?And i'm on my way to believing ? But the kind of truth i'm most thankful for-- The one you never see coming that falls right into your lap.

Gossip Girl here, Your one and only source Into the sandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
Bart's been in an accident.
My father turned his first profit by the time he was 22.
I hope to do it by the time I'm 21.
Oh, you're in love with her.
It's all over your face.
No.
Blair told me you were responsible For sabotaging me at cotillion.
Tripp is divorcing Maureen.
We're going away together.
It is a huge mistake.
You wanna talk to me about mistakes? You don't get to judge me.
Please don't get in the car.
Serena, you coming? And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

On lonely street Little runaway girl Do it again Do it again If you don't mind I do.
Serena, I can't stand this.
I love you.
Tripp, everything is ruined, already It's too late.
Serena, it doesn't have to be, Tripp! They say that there are no accidents.
Sometimes, reality comes crashing into us.
Other times, it dawns on us slowly, Despite our best efforts to ignore it.
Morning.
I brought your favorite.
Oh, you're up.
I haven't been sleeping well.
I know, hence the breakfast in bed Which will taste just as good in the living room.
I'm not hungry.
Stop trying to pretend, Chuck.
I know why you're upset.
Today is a day like any other.
In fact, I'm going to a meeting.
I'm looking at a property on the lower east side.
I can't be resting on my laurels.
The empire's doing well.
It's time to look ahead.
Well, since I canceled my day, I am now completely free, so I'm coming with you.
Hey.
I thought you were getting ready for that co-op meeting.
Oh.
Right.
It slipped my mind.
You cleaning out the closet again? I thought you did that yesterday and the day before.
Well, Vanya has organized a clothing drive-- "coats for Kiev.
" Vanya's from Minsk.
Lil, none of this is making much sense.
Does this have something to do with serena? What, other than the fact that she won't speak to me? That she's holed up with some married politician, Acting like some sort of teenage Rielle Hunter? Well, if it's this upsetting, let's do something about it.
Where is she? Let's bring her back.
Would you represent us at the co-op meeting today? It's about the rooftop garden.
You know how strict Those green people are about attendance.
If it'll help you out, I'm totally free.
I had a feeling you might say that.
What's that supposed to mean? Nothing.
I'm sorry.
Look, I know our family's going through a lot, And I love That you've made us your priority.
It's at park avenue autumn.
No, no.
Of course, sir.
I'm thrilled.
I'll be in touch with an answer.
Thanks again.
You've been ducking work all week.
Who was important enough for you to finally take their call? - Barney Frank.
Really? He asked me to serve on the finance subcommittee.
Oh! that's so exciting.
Hey, maybe--maybe this will all blow over.
Unfortunately, it has to blow up before it blows over.
It's only a matter of time before Maureen goes public.
And I can't hide out here forever.
Well, if being together means everything will fall apart, Then so be it.
It'll be hard, but we'll figure it out, Even if that means starting over.
Right.
Starting over.
Hey.
We'll get through this.
I'm gonna go into town and get some supplies.
No.
Don't be too long.
Um, this building is a homeless shelter.
"a," gross, and "b," really? I'm not a huge advocate of the downtrodden, But I am a fan of not stepping on them when I'm at John Derian.
If you turn these into lofts, Then where are they going to live? I don't know, blair.
One step at a time.
The owner of the building's waiting inside with the specs.
I-I'm sorry.
Far be it from me to be overcome with the holiday spirit, But this whole scrooge act? You should be at home today Or laying flowers on your father's grave.
I know today is the anniversary of his death.
Why don't you take the car And meet me at the hotel later for lunch? We'll have our quiet time then.
Fine.
Pretend like you never get sad And all you care about is making more money.
But just so we're clear, I know better.
And you, chuck bass, are not your father.
I know.
We make our own fortunes, And then call them fate.
Hey.
Can you meet me right now? I think we should talk.
And what better excuse to choose a path Than to insist it's our destiny? But at the end of the day, We all have to live with our choices You did the right thing, son.
No matter who's looking over our shoulder.
Spotted--an "it" girl with an "it" bag.
Looks like the roadie to success Is paved with cruel intentions.
Can I hold the baby? - Oh, it's beautiful! I've never seen one in the flesh.
Because it's not in stores yet.
Even the waiting list is still waiting.
I guess it pays to be Lily Bass' daughter.
Well, her name is "humphrey" now, And I got this through my own connections.
O.
M.
G.
! Twins! - You have the same bag! - how did you get that?! Well, great minds shop alike.
Although in the future, J, we should probably coordinate.
I'll take tuesdays and thursdays And alternate wednesdays? How about you take yours back to the store? You know I have first dibs on designer everything.
I'm--I'm sorry, Jenny.
But my mom brought this back for me from Paris.
It had its own seat on the plane.
Well, since you apparently love your new bag More than your old friends, I guess you can carry it Across the street.
Enjoy being B.
F.
F.
S with a hunk of leather.
So who wants to hold it first? Okay, that was totally humiliating.
That was kind of the point.
If we wanna turn Carmen and Jane against Jenny, We've gotta make them see that she is the meanest queen ever.
Consider the mission a success.
I had to pinch myself to keep from crying.
I know it's hard, but you have to stick with the plan.
And if the plan doesn't work? - If it does work, We'll make sure you end up the new queen.
You better.
But in the mean time I'm keepin' the bag.
Are you ready for phase two? Olivia called it, you know.
I mean, and I was--I was too stupid or too stubborn To realize that she was right about Vanessa.
And now my window's closed.
She's all off into This Paul Hoffman guy.
Dan, do you really think If you went toe-to-toe with paul hoffman That you couldn't take him down? You're using him as an excuse.
No, no, he's a.
.
he's a.
.
he's a handsome guy, a sophomore.
He and vanessa have a lot in common.
He's a douche.
Listen, you have two options here-- You can man up, go to war and fight for the girl you love, Or just forget her and move on to a palate cleanser.
So you're saying my only choices are Extreme emotional vulnerability with a good friend, Or meaningless s*x with a stranger? - Yeah, pretty much.
All right.
Hi.
We were just talking about you.
Oh.
Uh, we're going up to my country house this weekend, And I wondered if you wanted to come.
And there's a hot tub.
It's kind of a writers retreat.
And Paul's coming.
Oh you know, that sounds-- that sounds so tempting.
But I think, um, I got a lot of homework So I think I'm gonna stick around here.
Oh.
Okay.
I'll call you when we get back.
Okay.
See ya.
Dude, what was that? You should totally go.
You can box paul out of the hot tub - Or get with Willa.
Willa? Oh, yeah, she's so cute.
Look at her.
And she's a drama major.
Actresses are crazy.
Willa! - yeah? Yeah, you know what? Um on second thought, I'd love to go.
It sounds like fun.
Really? - Yeah.
Great.
We're meeting at the dorms tonight.
Come find me.
Will do.
You're welcome.
Looks like I won.
Hi, I'm rufus humphrey, lily's-- Husband.
Hi.
Holland Kemble.
We'd been placing bets on when you'd show up, and I had today.
Oh, why? Did Bart used to come to these meetings? Nope.
Not once.
But an attractive man like yourself Moves into the building based on your comings and goings, It doesn't seem like you have a boardroom to run Or a hedge fund to manage, So we figured it was just a matter of time.
I-I-I think you have the wrong idea.
I'm not some sort of trophy husband.
My family's just in transition.
It's okay.
We all sacrifice our independence for love.
At first it seems totally worth it.
It's just later after you've given everything up That you realize you have nothing left to offer.
That's when your husband starts banging his yoga teacher.
Sorry.
That was probably an overshare.
Ladies and gentleman, Let's begin.
You said you were getting groceries.
Where are you? I'm with my grandfather, actually.
He got wind of what was going down and called.
Honestly, I'm relieved to get his advice.
Well, I'm glad you're working things out, But you left me alone.
And there's no coffee or cable.
And I came here to be with you.
I know, and I so appreciate you being patient.
You're there for me 100%, and I'm the one who's a mess.
True.
But your life is pretty complicated, And I knew what I was getting myself into.
Thank you for understanding.
I'll see you tonight.
Wait, tonight? Deep breath, Tripp.
If we handle this right, you'll be able to keep The career you worked so hard for And get the woman of your dreams, And I'll still have my marriage.
Why are you okay with this? - We both share A dream we're not willing to give up on.
I was hoping you'd come to your senses, and now you have.
I do care about my career, But not as much as I care about Serena.
I just wanna make sure I'm being clear about that.
It's my personal opinion that Serena is just a phase.
A few years from now, We'll look back and all this will be a faded memory.
Well, that's where our opinions diverge.
I'm willing to take that chance.
I guess now we see if Serena's willing to bet against you.
I'm thinking a personal appeal, woman-to-woman.
I liked what I saw today.
Seems like the right property at the right time.
You have the cash.
You should've signed at the site, Be moving forward by now.
There's just a few things I need to figure out first.
Like the building's residents? They're not your concern.
And if you want the write-off for '09, You need to be breaking ground by the new year, so Ho ho homeless.
No disrespect, But I don't need your advice.
I've been doing pretty well without you.
Oh, yeah.
The empire.
Nice hotel.
Thank you.
But to be honest, I haven't seen anything in the last year That suggest you have what it takes.
If anything.
You've been a disappointment.
You opened your heart to Blair, And it made you weak.
You cannot be One person at work and another one at home.
If you're soft, you're soft.
And well, let's face it-- You're soft.
"I love you, too.
" Hey, I'm sorry to call.
I know you probably don't wanna hear from me after Thanksgiving.
No.
No, of course I do.
I've been thinking about you.
Just worried.
Is everything okay? Where's Tripp? He's out.
I'm at the cottage, and the heat died.
I know you've been here before.
So do you know how to restart it? You know, I've actually, um, only been there over the summer.
I don'tI don't know how to help you.
Okay, heat is optional, But please tell me there's a microwave or Wi-fi.
I'm--I'm starved and bored out of my mind.
Ever read "the old man and the sea"? I prefer Fitzgerald to Hemingway.
Yeah, I've never read it either, But go look for it on the bookshelf.
It's blue with a yellow bookmark.
Oh! And the location of your secret boyhood pot stash.
Just don't tell grandfather.
Tripp and I hid it there a couple of summers ago, So it might be a little dusty, But it's the best I can do Till Tripp gets back.
Where is he, anyway? - Actually, he's with your grandfather Getting advice on the difficult days ahead.
Nate? Yeah, just, um listen, stay warm, And if you need anything else, just give me a buzz.
Like a lighter? Hey, I'mI'm really glad we can still talk.
Yeah, me, too.
Bye.
Hello, Serena.
Maureen.
You have no reason to be here.
Get out or I'll call Tripp.
Who do you think told me you were here? Tripp and I aren't getting divorced.
You can have him in private, But I get him in public.
He keeps his career, I keep my pride and position, And you get Whatever you're getting.
Screwed, I think they call it.
Y-you're asking me to be your husband's mistress? It's a time-honored political tradition.
I'm Jackie.
You're Marilyn.
I love Tripp, and I'd do anything to make him happy.
What makes him happy is being with me.
I know Tripp would never send you here.
He knows that I wouldn't agree with this.
He was skeptical, it's true.
But he didn't know that I have this.
Where'd you get that? The more relevant question is what your stepfather will say When he finds out your mother is a cheating whore.
Your mother and father alone in his hotel room What do you think they were doing? I don't know.
The letter doesn't say.
Knowing Lily, I think we can assume the worst.
I'm pretty sure Rufus will.
Okay, then.
You think about my offer.
Honestly, with this letter, I could've forced you out of the picture altogether.
But it's not what Tripp wants, so I'm being pragmatic.
I hope you'll decide to do the same.
I thought you were meeting me for lunch.
I had too much to drink.
Oh.
Well We'll just order room service.
Look, I really don't need you to take care of me.
I know How hard it was for you to let your guard down To let me in.
But you've changed.
I'm buying that building.
Chuck - Don't tell me what to do.
I'm not.
Just talk to me.
Blair I need you to get out of here now.
Chuck.
Now.
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
You know, Jenny said that if she was chosen to be queen, Then things would be better, But if you think about it, things are actually kinda worse.
Blair never banished a girl for getting a gift.
It is almost Christmas.
Right.
There could be wish list carnage.
Think about it.
Did someone mention christmas? Happy holidays, ladies.
See, that's why I was so mad at Sawyer, Cause she ruined the surprise.
It's Y.
S.
L.
For everyone.
O.
M.
G.
B.
G.
E.
! Oh, my god! Best gift ever! I love you! I love you, too! Jenny, where did you even get the money? My mom's generous, but she wouldn't give you The price of a smart car to spend on purses.
Come on, ladies.
Let's go buy matching lipstick.
Chuck's having such a difficult day, And since I'm sure you are, too, I thought you might have some words of advice.
Cyrus says it's an essential part of life, honoring the dead.
But Chuck refuses to visit Bart's grave even today.
On the anniversary of his death.
Do you know that Chuck's never been to his mother's grave once? I can understand not going on the date she died It is his birthday after all But Bart refused to tell him where Evelyn was even buried, Said it was morbid for a child to visit a cemetery.
Lily? Mm.
Are you listening? - Yes, of course I am, Blair.
And I will go see Charles and talk to him.
Thank you.
Hello, Mr.
Humphrey.
Blair.
What brings you here? I was just looking for backup from Lily.
Bart's 1-year mark.
Oh.
Lil, why didn't you say something? No wonder you're so upset today.
Bart's death was such a tough time.
Thank you for standing by me.
Mm.
I don't know what I would ever do if I lost you.
Well, I'm not going anywhere.
It's not that I believe Maureen, But Tripp hasn't returned any of my texts or messages, And I need to talk to him.
I think that you should be open To the idea that at least some of what Maureen was saying - Might be true.
Why would you say that? I've risked everything to be with Tripp.
I have to have faith.
Your grandfather just loves to talk.
Tripp will be home soon, and he'll explain everything.
Serena, my grandfather's in Bermuda.
What? When we got off the phone earlier, I called my mom, just to be sure.
I don't know where Tripp is, but he's lying - to you.
Will you excuse me? I have to go.
Look likes the love nest has become a hornet's nest Sir, how long till we get to Nassau county? And here comes Nate to stir it up.
Come in.
I, um, I'm ready to go.
So I don't know if you got a car Or we're taking the train or what.
I told Paul and Vanessa we'd be a while.
I'd like your thoughts on something While we're still alone.
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, sure.
What is it? It's a performance art piece I did.
It's kind of Karen Finley meets Daryl Hannah in "Legal Eagles," But without Clothing.
You're, uh You're naked there.
Hello, Charles.
How are you? Busy.
I told the front desk not to bother sending you up.
I'm on my way out.
Well, wherever you're going, Will you put it off for a few hours And come with me to the cemetery? I can't.
It's business.
Well, we both know that your father was a complicated man.
And I honestly think that he thought It was just easier to be alone.
And you know what? There are moments that I think I agree with him.
But we're not that way, I'm afraid.
We need each other.
And right now, I need you To do this with me.
I'm sorry, Lily, But I believe The way to honor my father is to work.
Sometimes we need to do something To show people how we feel, Even when they're not here to see it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's Serena.
Excuse me.
Mom, it's me.
Serena, are you okay? You sound upset.
I'll be fine, eventually.
I know how mad you are that I chose to go with Tripp - Rather than following your advice.
Well, I never wanted to punish you, just protect you.
You don't need to explain.
Right now I just need my mom.
Okay? Of course, darling.
Maureen has my letter from dad.
What? I don't know how she got it, But she doesn't want to leave Tripp, And she's threatening to show it to Rufus.
Oh, my god.
What does Tripp say? I don't know, because I can't get in touch with him.
And it doesn't matter anyway, Because I know he's lying to me.
Oh, Serena, I'm so sorry for that letter And what happened with your father.
I'll tell Rufus everything, Which I should have done already.
Look, just get home, And we'll fix everything, okay? I promise.
Thank you, mom.
I love you.
I love you, too.
So much for the day of the dead.
Yes, I'm afraid I have to attend to the living right now.
Look, I hope you'll consider what I said, Maybe do this for both of us.
They should be yellow roses.
They were my mother's favorite.
Serena, where are you going? Away from you, liar.
I'll find a cab.
Serena, wait.
Tell me it isn't true.
Tell me that you're getting a divorce, That you spent the entire day talking to your grandfather And that you didn't send Maureen here, And Nate is just jealous.
I can't even look at you.
Serena, let me at least drive you.
I'll take you back to the city.
We can talk in the car.
You know I want to be with you more than anything.
Please.
Let me explain.
I'll get in the car, but no talking.
I'm done talking.
Dream, little girl On lonely street Little runaway girl Do it again Do it again Tripp! Run, run, run away, little girl Get your fun in this trashy world Empty-hearted boys by your side Lick your lips and suicide Maureen? Something terrible's happened.
I need help.
Oh my god Serena! What happened? Where's tripp? Tripp? Is he okay? No, Serena, Tripp's not here.
He was driving.
This is Tripp.
Leave a message.
Tripp? I need to see you right now.
You meet me at the hospital or I'm going to the cops.
What is that heavenly smell? I am christening the kitchen with a little bolognese.
I figured you could use some comfort food today.
Are the kids home yet? Not yet.
Well, since we have a little alone time, There's something I want to tell you.
Sounds serious.
It is.
Oh, god.
It's 5-1-6.
It might be serena.
Hello? Mm.
Mm.
I'mI'm s.
.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's 100% me.
It's not you, you know.
Um, and yourthis performance thing is amazing.
You're.
.
you're a-a great kisser.
Uh, I just.
.
oh.
You know what? I gottaI gotta take this.
I'm sorry.
Serena's been in a car accident.
What? Yeah.
I-I don't know much, but we gotta go.
What happened? Wait.
Where are you going? - I'll explain on the way.
Come on.
What? What now, Blair? I'll see you there.
Arthur, change of destination.
We're going to Nassau county.
What are you doing? We're almost there.
Everyone's waiting.
I'm sure they're gonna have a backup offer lined up.
Would you just leave me alone?! You get to the L.
I.
E.
Stop looking at me.
What were you thinking, Tripp? Have you seen her? Is serena okay? You left her alone in a wrecked car And you moved her? What happened to you, man? You know, you were-- You were the good guy.
You were the honest one.
Nate, you've gotta understand-- - Oh, I fully understand.
I called 9-1-1.
Oh, come on.
Are you serious? Look, I know we're family, But what you did is unforgivable.
When the cops start asking questions, I'm telling them the truth.
The truth is that Tripp was with me.
I told you to stay in the car.
I think the days of you telling me what to do Are behind us, don't you? I've spoken to William.
He's got Tripp's back on this one.
If anyone starts asking questions, I'm ready with a statement That says Tripp was with me all night.
What about serena's statement? With her history of drinking and drugs, Not to mention her unstable family background And the many, many men In any case, your grandfather is very well liked By the sheriff's department around here.
Coming, Tripp? I'd love to see her.
You don't think you could help me get Spotted-- the fall of a politician You stay the hell away from her.
And the rise of a hero.
Poor congressman.
You've been vetoed.
I am so sorry.
I guess I had to learn the hard way.
Well, like mother, like daughter.
Is Rufus here? Well, um, he's coming, But I asked him to look for your health insurance papers.
They're somewhere in my desk.
Mom, my insurance card is in my wallet.
You didn't tell him, did you? Well, I was going to, And then the hospital called.
And, um, with Maureen and who knows what else, I didn't know what we'd be walking into here.
I-I just need to rest now.
Please.
Okay.
Hi.
Hi.
Nice outfit.
You, too.
You were so right about this one.
What are you doing out here? Come on.
I'm sorry, Mrs.
Bass.
Charles, the doctors say there's nothing more they can do.
We have to let him go.
Chuck, stay.
Be here with us.
How's Serena? She's gonna be okay.
Lily's here? Eric's here? Everyone's here.
Chuck? My father always thought I was weak.
And in the moment that mattered most, I was.
I couldn't be there when he, uh I left, ran away.
I've been Pushing myself To prove him wrong, and Been pushing you away.
I don't think you ran away Because you couldn't handle death.
I think it's because you couldn't handle feelings.
But you're not like that anymore.
You're strong.
You carry people.
You carry me.
You're becoming a man in a way that Your father never was.
Come.
Let's say good-bye.
You always Thank you.
You want a sip of my coffee? - No, thanks.
I was just offering.
Just declining the offer.
Eric, I'm sorry.
Jenny, can we stop this? So I'm assuming you set sawyer up with that bag.
Me and Kira, yeah.
I heard you talking to that shopgirl on the phone.
I knew you were listening to that call.
Which is why you were ready with the bags for Jane and Carmen.
You are starting to scare me.
Right back at ya.
And I wouldn't have had to do it If it wasn't for your smear campaign.
Which you totally deserved.
Hey, truce? Yeah.
Come on.
Let's go buy serena One of those hideous stuffed bears at the gift shop With the "get well soon" balloon.
Maureen, hi.
I-I-I'm actually on my way out.
I know you must be surprised to see me, But if you have a moment I've been having some difficulties in my marriage, And I'd hate to see anyone Suffer through the same pain that I have.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Somehow this ended up in my coat pocket at thanksgiving.
Just read it.
I mean, imagine if Serena would have hit her head A little harder or the car rolled or the-- Vanessa I love you.
I love you, too.
Dan.
That was not the reaction I was hoping for.
Dan, sometimes when people are under a lot of emotional stress, They say things that they don't really mean.
Yeah, I was, uh, I-I-I think I-I read that somewhere.
I'm gonna go see if Serena needs anything.
Yeah, I'm up at brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca Right next to De Niro, but I'll be 'hood forever I'm the new Sinatra And since I made it here, I can make it anywhere Yeah, they love me everywhere Rufus? Sinatra sings, "New York, New York, it's a helluva town.
" But on the upper east side, Sometimes it just feels like hell.
New york Concrete jungle where dreams are made of I think I might need some advice.
Even when we're sure we've earned that happy ending It doesn't always come.
Second thoughts creep in.
Secret missions sneak out.
And only sleeping beauty finds her prince.
Hey, you're late.
These guys are texting.
They're waiting.
Sorry.
It was a hectic night.
Do you even have it on you? Well, can I hold it? The queen bee likes a thrill, yeah? And, uh, this time, I want to go to the table alone.
By the way, those handbags totally saved my ass, So, uh, thanks for making that happen.
Don't thank me.
You earned that money.
And I needed it.
It's not easy being queen.
Or cheap.
Stick with me, Jenny Humphrey, And you'll have enough cash to underwrite your entire kingdom.
In this city, nothing is for certain.
The night can push you forward into a dark future Or plunge you into a mysterious past.
Lily? Charles.
My father turned his first profit by the time he was 22.
I hope to do it by the time i'm Because you believe in me.
You were the one that needed to kiss her again, To realize for yourself that your feelings for her are real.
Vanessa, i love you.
Oh, that's not really the reaction i was hoping for.
It's not easy being queen.
Sounds like kind of a yawn.
Yes, compared to being an international drug dealer.
A little bit of danger is what makes life worth living.
Two years ago at the masquerade ball, I tried to tell you i loved you.
You loved me? I hope i'm not interrupting.
Tripp is divorcing maureen.
We're going away together.
It is a huge mistake.
I love tripp, and i'd do anything to make him happy.
Where'd you get that? The more relevant question is what your stepfather will say When he finds out that your mother is a cheating whore.
You left her alone in a wrecked car?! You stay the hell away from her.
You're becoming a man in a way that your father never was.
Lily? Charles.
His beloved wife died giving birth to me.

It was the worst of times.

Word has it s.
Gave up politics to focus on issues Closer to her heart.
I can't believe nate's finally coming home tomorrow.
I feel the same way about dorota's return.
I never should have agreed To let her spend the holidays with vanya.
Did i tell you that he texts me Every night before he goes to sleep? It's so sweet.
Sexting is not sweet.
It's off-Limits until you're in a relationship.
You haven't even been on a date.
Well, you'll be happy to know he asked me to go to a dinner For the french ambassador tomorrow night.
Oh, well, chastity belts go very well with formal wear.
I'm serious, s.
I'm all for you trying this thing with nate, But if you want it to become real, Then you're going to have to take it slow.
Okay, i-I promise i will.
I have to go.
Damien dalgaard! Hey! Hey! Oh, my gosh! How are ya? Good.
I thought you were gonna become a belgian prince Or something after boarding school.
My father took the ambassador post.
Wow.
You look even more fantastic than you did in school.
Oh, that was not a very good time for me.
That's not true.
I seem to remember some fun spanish classes.
Really? More like me crying over conjugations While you got straight a's and won all the athletic awards.
You had the mr.
Perfect thing down.
Well, i'm late to meet a friend.
So, uh, i'd love to catch up some more.
Yeah, great.
Text me your number.
Okay.
Good to see you.
Yeah, you, too.
Hey, are you going to the french ambassador dinner Tomorrow night? I am.
Then i'll see you there.
See you there.
 ba ba ba-Ba-Ba   ba ba  You know how torturous it is For me to find shiny things that aren't intended for me.
It's just a worthless trinket Some woman left by my father's grave.
And you aren't even the least bit curious About someone who wears your father around her neck? One of his concubines had his name tattooed on her ass.
I have more important things to do than search For another member of the female bart bass fan club.
Like helping me achieve The college experience i so greatly deserve? I assume you're referring to my lunch To discuss parisian hotel possibilities With henri duris.
Who my research also tells me is The rumored president of table litaire.
Just imagining my life as a member Of the most exclusive secret society makes me tingle.
Well, while i find that incredibly arousing, You know i can't promise anything but an introduction.
All i need to know is That the most persuasive and powerful man i've ever met Is on my side.
 i say we're out to blow the trumpet   to wake you all from bed   from bed   ba ba ba-Ba-Da-Ba-Da-Ba   ba ba ba-Ba  So how was your mom's? I'm sure your dad called every day.
Well, he v-Chatted for present opening.
You didn't want to go to telluride with him, huh? I can't say i blame you.
Those lincoln hawk guys can be kind of annoying.
Well, he was so excited when it came up.
I couldn't stand for him to miss out.
Hi.
Welcome home.
Damien, hi.
Hey.
Lily, you remember damien, right? Oh, yes.
Yes.
Hello.
Mrs.
Humphrey, how are you? And, uh, this is for you.
Thank you.
Mm.
Um, thank you, lily, for helping me unpack, But i think i'm good now.
Um, jenny? Um, a word, please? So your father and i haven't really discussed You having boys alone in your room.
Maybe just keep the door open? Lily, if we wanted to have s*x, we'd just go to a hotel.
And seriously, it's not like that with us.
Oh, then what is it like? I mean, he seems happy to see you.
Um, i'll open the door if anything changes.
Oh, and you wouldn't happen to know When your father was coming back? Larissa accidentally lost the itinerary.
I think he said today, but just call him and ask.
So cookies.
Let me guess.
I have a puzzle that needs solving.
I know how much you humphreys like games.
It's my work, all right.
Do you remember who you sold this one to? The picture's right there- Bart bass.
Do you know who he bought it for? Mr.
Bass kept the recipients of his purchases private.
But a woman did bring this one To repair the hinge about a month ago.
The woman- Early 40s, brown hair, brown eyes? Look, i would be very grateful If you could share any other information you may have.
I'm sorry.
Client confidentiality.
My father was the original client.
Please, this is all i have left of him.
Elizabeth fisher.
She paid in cash.
But she had it delivered.
Thank you.
With enough time, we all find what we're looking for even if it was there all along.
Nate! What are you doing here? Hey.
Oh, my gosh.
You weren't supposed to be here until tomorrow.
I know.
My grandfather got sick of watching me text you, So he had the plane bring me home early.
Well, remind me to send him a gift.
Well, i should go.
I left the driver downstairs waiting with the bags, So i could surprise you, but tomorrow, though, right? Yes, our first official date.
I've been thinking, a- And i really think That we should try to take this slow.
Yeah.
Yeah, i was thinking the same thing.
Okay.
And when time slows, And suddenly every moment counts, All you want is for this time to last forever.
Hey.
What? I'm not that late.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, man.
I was just hoping you were vanessa.
Oh, you invited vanessa here, too? No, not exactly.
But she does spend a lot of time here.
I take it that means you still haven't talked to her.
Or gotten a text or seen her.
It's my fault.
I moved too fast, you know? I read, like, five self-Help blogs About how to turn friends into lovers.
Yes, they use that word.
I was a little down at my mom's place.
Well, hey, man, i'm sorry.
You know, they say that you should take things more slowly With a friend than you do with someone you just met.
I'll-I'll send you the link.
You might want to read it Before you start this thing with serena.
Hey.
Oh.
Looks like my advice went the way of the clog.
What are you talking about? The clog? An ugly wooden shoe That tried to make a statement, then disappeared- Just like your resolve to take things slow with nate.
I'm just gonna go with it.
You know, whatever happens, happens.
All right, well, knowing serena, what'll probably happen is She'll get swept up in the romance of things, And she's not gonna want to talk about any of that stuff ever.
Really.
Nah, look, it's cool.
I've known serena since i was a little kid.
And we've already you know, years ago.
I know.
Trust me.
Now that i'm with chuck, i can see that nate and i Were only perfect on paper.
But you and nate can finally be more than just an affair to remember.
Which is why we didn't want to wait for it to start.
And why you don't want to scare him off.
Listen, the point is i've dated serena for over a year.
And if you want to be able to make things work, You're gonna have to be able to come up for air, Which is really not her favorite thing to do.
You are the one thing nate has always wanted And could never have.
It's like a diet.
After years of starvation, You can't just let him gorge on sundaes.
He'll panic and decide he hates ice cream.
Except i'm not ice cream, And nate and i don't need to play games.
Everyone needs to play games.
Look, you've already failed to come out of the gate With any restraint or control.
Now all you can do is Introduce some competition, make him work for it.
Blair, that's the worst advice i've ever heard.
Mm-Hmm.
Just wait till he starts passing on dessert.
So the ambassador's daughter's gonna be at this dinner? Yeah, but her father's got her under 24-Hour surveillance, Which means her guards will be on her at all times.
Well, i can meet her in the ladies' room.
I bet they don't follow her in there.
Or we could switch handbags.
You-You need to understand.
This is a state dinner, Which means there's security everywhere.
All bags will be searched.
The problem is not getting the package to violette, It's getting the package in in the first place.
I could wear it.
I can make this.
Only in mine, the paillettes won't be empty.
You put the pills in the jacket? Yeah, i wear it to the dinner, Check it and then violette and i switch coat check tags.
I take her coat and she'll leave with yours.
It's not bad.
Not bad? Come on.
It's brilliant! Lily? Oh, hello, daniel.
Hey.
What-What you doing in brooklyn? Um, i was hoping your father would be here.
He was supposed to be back this morning.
I can't imagine he'd come here before going to see you.
Well, i just figured Since he hadn't seen you over the holidays you know how sentimental he is.
Yeah.
Dad? Well, you know what? Maybe he decided to stay and ski another day.
Uh, yeah, i don't-I don't think that's what happened.
Well, i should go.
If you see him, Tell him i stopped by.
Okay.
Vronsky, where are you? Anna karenina texted you an hour ago.
She wants to celebrate.
Look, i'm sorry, but anna will have to wait.
I'm about to walk into a meeting.
With monsieur duris? Are you bringing him here to surprise me? As it turns out, i wasn't able to attend the lunch.
Are you in the hospital? Since i know that you're alive, There could be no other possible reason You would sacrifice my entire future.
Look, i'll get you your introduction, okay? Monsieur duris will be attending The dinner for the french ambassador tomorrow night.
Oh, thank god.
You practically gave me a heart attack.
Why didn't you mention this earlier? I just assumed you'd rather not cross paths with carla bruni.
Well, in times of crisis, Sacrifices must be made.
Why did you miss lunch? I'm trying to meet someone whose schedule is Even more unpredictable than mine.
I'll see you tonight.
I've been waiting here for four hours.
Has elizabeth fisher still not returned? She did return, mr.
Bass.
Then why did she not get my message That i was waiting for her in the bar? She did.
She checked out of the hotel immediately afterwards.
Whoa! Hey, blair.
It's anna karenina.
You never read it.
Don't worry about it.
I never do.
Come on, boy.
Rufus.
Hi.
What are you doing standing out here? Making a decision.
How are you doing? Did you end up going away? I just got back this morning.
And are you back for good? That's what i'm deciding.
I came over to talk to lily, but now i'm not sure.
I want to give her a chance to explain.
But still, there's a part of me that doesn't want to know.
Cup of coffee? It's freezing out here.
Coffee actually sounds really good.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mm.
Hey.
Hey.
I was just about to call you.
Well, now you don't have to.
Or we don't have to talk at all.
Look, i, um, I was just thinking that maybe it might make sense If i go to that dinner tomorrow night alone.
I don't understand.
Did i do something wrong? No.
No, not at all.
I just you know, we said we didn't want to rush into things.
Yeah, but that was before we saw each other.
I know.
I know.
But i'm just trying to stick to the plan here.
Okay, so the plan went from having s*x On eleanor waldorf's floor to not seeing each other? Just because we lost track for a minute there Doesn't mean we should just forget about it.
I mean, we already saw each other today.
We can wait a couple more days, right? You're right, nate.
Uh, the last thing i would want to do is rush into something.
that we sung
No.
Serena, come on.
Hello?
Hey, damien.
Serena.
Don't tell me you need help with your spanish homework.
No, french this time.
Please tell me You don't have a date to the ambassador's dinner.
Are you asking me if i want to go with you? Of course i do.
Great.
I'm staying at the waldorfs', So i'll text you the address.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Heure, hora, laat- No matter what language you say it in, Looks like s.
Just started the clock On a ticking time bomb.
I thought you'd be at school by now.
I thought you lived In the upper east side with your wife.
Dan.
Lily came by yesterday looking for you.
Uh, what's-What's going on? Lily and i had a fight.
It's complicated.
Israeli-Palestinian complicated by the looks of it.
Is this-Is this why you shipped jenny and me Off to mom's for christmas? This was your mother's year.
And it wasn't one of those "parent trap" situations That you and jenny could swoop in on.
Lily and i need time to figure this out.
And, um, and you're doing that By not telling her where you are? It's not the best strategy, But until i actually talk to her, at least i can Hold out hope that i'm wrong about what happened.
So you're not talking to her because you don't want to hear What you think she might tell you? You know, i'm not willing to explain myself, dan.
All right.
Fine.
Fine.
You can make your own damn waffles.
Come on, dan.
Listen, you're-You're the one who's always saying To be honest and talk about things, So i really hope you're not gonna let your marriage die Because you're scared to take your own advice.
 oh  Ta-Da! All the girls are gonna want to wear pharmaceuticals.
It's perfect.
I'm impressed.
Thanks.
I'm really excited about tonight.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Me, too.
Unfortunately, we're gonna have to do our little dinner Some other time.
What? I thought we were doing this together.
It's my plan.
Yeah.
I know.
And-And i thank you.
It's just that, uh, anyone can check the jacket.
Uh i'm going with someone else- Serena, actually.
We're old friends from boarding school.
Serena's with nate now.
I don't know about that.
She's the one who called and asked me, so well, you know she's changed since boarding school, And, uh, there's-There's no way she's gonna go to a state dinner Wearing a jacket filled with pills.
I probably won't tell her about that then.
Well, then maybe i will.
See, if you were to do that, Then i would have to tell her how you know, obviously.
So anyway, Um, Don't worry.
You'll still get your cut.
What's going on? Why aren't you dressed? Look, blair, i'm sorry.
But i won't be able to join you for dner ce soir.
Abandoning me in a fur hat is one thing, But you can't do this.
You already missed the lunch.
You know my dreams are dead Without a proper introduction to monsieur duris.
Look, i left word with his people That you'd be there, okay? I'm sure you'll find a way to make an impression.
This is about her, isn't it? The floozy from your father's grave You said you had no interest in finding.
It appears i may have spoken too quickly in that regard.
First you lie to me about looking for her, And now you're going to sacrifice My table litaire charter to go look for some random woman.
You obviously read the file, so you know she's not random.
She knew my mother's favorite flowers, She had a picture of my father in her jewelry and she knew me.
And clearly has no interest in being found by you.
You've been looking for weeks, and nothing.
One dinner with me won't make a difference.
I know you may find this hard to comprehend, But some things are more important Than your social-Climbing agenda.
  downtown jail   downtown jail  His name's damien.
Oh, hey, jenny.
He's the son of the belgian ambassador, And i'm pretty sure they hooked up at boarding school.
I'm guessing serena didn't tell you She was coming with him, huh? No.
No, she didn't.
Why are you here? I figured you've come to my rescue enough times.
Let me help you for once.
Hi.
May i take your coat? You came with him? You came with her? I think you're at the wrong place.
Prom is down the street.
Oh, that's fine.
I'll just let you get back to your euro-Fawning.
Jenny, um what are you doing here? Just finishing what i started.
Serena, i love your jacket.
It's so beautiful.
Yeah, actually, let me help you with that.
No, it's okay.
I'm gonna keep it on.
It's so pretty, and it was a gift from you.
So sweet of you.
Come on.
So much for diplomacy.
Let the international games begin.
Serena.
And not nate.
Hi.
I'm blair.
Damien.
A pleasure.
Um, the, uh, french ambassador's daughter's An old friend of mine.
I'm gonna let you guys mm.
Excuse me.
I see you took my advice.
It's good to keep nate on his toes.
And nice choice of competition.
Thank you.
Your idea's completely juvenile, but it seems to be working.
I'm jenny.
Nice to meet you.
Thank you so much.
I still can't believe he came with jenny, though.
If i know jenny, she came with him.
But trust me.
This is exactly what you wanted.
Games will be played, sexual innuendo ensues.
And in the end, nate will be right where you wanted him.
My problems are not nearly so easily resolved.
Even monsieur duris' entourage Is perfection in bone structure and styling.
While without a formal introduction, I have no choice but to stalk him.
Blair, you know you don't need chuck.
Anyone who meets you can see you're an elitist snob Who's perfect to run a secret society.
Bonne chance.
Ah! Merci.
Ah.
On a un petit soucis, mais je t'assure Que tu l'auras au prix demand  la fin de la soire.
Tu as intrt, sinon, J'appellerai le flic pour cette garce qui le porte.
Uh, hi.
I'm jenny.
Wow.
French people really are rude.
She's usually a much happier customer.
Yeah.
Looks like the plan's off the rails thanks to serena, huh? From what i recall from boarding school, It wasn't terribly difficult to get serena out of her clothes.
That jacket is not leaving this party on serena van der woodsen.
Serena, i don't know why you're here with that guy.
I mean, if you're trying to make me jealous, There's no reason to.
I want to be here with you.
I invited you.
But then you uninvited me.
But you're right.
Taking it slow was the right decision.
Hi.
Damien.
Nate archibald.
Serena, let me introduce you to some people.
Thanks for keeping my date company.
So what's the deal with nate, The guy who seemed like he wanted to cut my head off? Is he an ex-Boyfriend or something? Oh, possibly a new one.
Honestly, that's the reason I asked you to bring me here tonight.
I'm sorry.
No, don't be.
The old make-Him-Jealous- By-Bringing-The-Titled-European ploy.
Yep.
Well, i'm flattered you thought i was worthy of the task.
Well, thank you for understanding.
If you really want to make him jealous, though, I suggest we commit fully, you know? Let me take off this jacket.
No, damien.
I'm sorry.
I- I can't do this.
This was a huge mistake already.
I no, no, no.
We can make it better.
No strings attached.
Damien, i-I don't like you like that.
I mean it.
Hey.
Are you serious? What happened to the serena that i wanted Throughout boarding school? I've changed, and it's a good thing.
Serena.
I'm sorry.
That-That wasn't monsieur duris? C'est vous n'est-Ce pas? I'm sorry.
Have we been introduced? I'm blair waldorf.
Perhaps you've heard of me? I submitted a charter application for n.
Y.
U.
Um can you just hold on one minute? Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.
Chuck.
There you are.
I knew you'd see the error of your ways.
Monsieur duris just stepped out for his cigarette break, Which gives us two and a half minutes, maybe four, If it's a gauloise.
I came to apologize.
Ugh.
What happened? Don't tell me that awful whore did something terrible to you.
I think that whore may be my mother.
There you are.
Serena's about to leave.
You need to stop her.
You know what, jenny? This just isn't fun for me anymore.
I should have never listened to dan.
Okay, i don't know what dan said, But why would you take romantic advice From a guy who has a cabbage patch doll? I don't know.
All you need to know is i blew my chance.
The masquerade ball was two years ago.
Don't let serena get away again.
You know your mother died during childbirth.
What if she didn't? What if it was just another of my father's many lies? Look, It makes sense that when you finally let your father go, Your mother would reappear.
She's not a ghost, blair.
Don't you think i know how crazy this sounds? It's why i couldn't tell you or anyone.
I'm aware that one of bart's old girlfriends May have known my name, And maybe even look like old pictures of my mother.
But my father only had one of these made with an "e" on it.
This woman had it.
Whoever she is, It just seems like she'll make losing your mom hurt all over again.
Do you really think Anything could be more painful Than killing my own mother And having my father hate me for it my whole life? If there is any chance This isn't what happened, i have to know.
I don't want to keep you From your business with monsieur duris.
I just had to let you know.
Nothing is more important than being with you for this.
Sometimes despite the risk, The only thing to do is seize the moment or whatever else you can grab.
I really always hope that blair is wrong about these things, But if the only reason you want to be with me is Because i'm with someone else, then you can forget it.
No, i want to be here with you.
I just got scared That if we moved too fast things weren't gonna work out, And i really don't want that to happen.
Okay, because i've waited I've waited a really long time for this.
Me, too.
We need to talk.
Rufus, finally.
I- I-I must have called you a hundred times.
I told you i'd call you back when i was ready.
Well, i guess i just didn't expect it to take quite so long.
Well, i guess you should have thought about that Before you spent the night in a hotel room with your ex-Husband.
Well, i'm here now.
So why don't you tell me exactly what happened? Lil, i'm not interested in any more lies.
We should probably go.
Mnh-Mnh.
Let's finish what we started.
Not having any fun? No.
No, but you go ahead and have yours.
Please gloat.
You've earned it.
Well, you're always telling me that this is a business And not my social life, But yet you're the one who screwed up a major deal Because you wanted to fulfill A high school dream of a night with serena van der woodsen.
Irony duly noted.
Maybe next time you won't be so quick to dismiss me.
I don't know if there will be a next time.
Word of this botched job will get around to my other clients.
And i owe violette more money Than i could possibly steal back from my father, So i think it's time for me to head back to the continent.
Hey, damien.
What is that jacket doing on the floor? It belongs to the ambassador's daughter.
She'll be furious.
Hang it up and make absolutely sure That violette gets it when she leaves.
Looks like you can cancel that transatlantic ticket.
I guess so.
Elizabeth? I'm sorry.
Have we met? You ran away from me at my father's grave.
I'm charles bass.
Oh, of course.
I apologize for my sudden departure.
It was a very emotional day for me.
You must have known my father very well.
I'm not sure what gives you that impression.
Your father and i simply shared A few memorable months many years ago.
I was actually visiting my mother's grave, And i just stopped to pay my respects.
At that time of the night? On the anniversary of my father's death? I saw you had his favorite flowers.
And you knew who i was.
I'm sorry.
I i read that bart had a son, And you look just like your father.
Most people say i more closely resemble my mother.
I wouldn't know.
I never had the pleasure of meeting her.
Well, maybe you can tell me why You had her locket.
Oh.
Your father gave it to me.
The "e" is for "elizabeth.
" I loved to believe it was a special gift.
I'm fairly certain he gave it To all his girlfriends at the time.
You're welcome to keep it, if you'd like.
I'm sure it means a great deal more to you than it does to me.
I'm sorry i can't help you find Whatever it is you're looking for.
Blair, i'm sorry to waste your time.
You should have stayed with monsieur duris.
I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.
I'm just going to visit the ladies' room.
Then we'll leave.
I'll bring the car around.
Elizabeth.
I already told your friend everything i know.
And he may have bought it.
But i originated that innocent, doe-Eyed stare.
I usually employ it when i know more than i'm willing to let on.
Chuck spent his entire life Believing that he killed his mother.
If you know anything that could take away even a second of that pain, It would be cruel not to share it.
Otherwise, Leaving town means never having to say you're sorry.
Look, i was exhausted.
I was scared.
I thought my mother was going to die.
He's a doctor.
He knew people that could help her.
I had to seek him out.
I already knew about cece being sick, And i know that she got better.
And i'm not gonna sit here for another hour While you talk around this thing.
What do you want me to tell you? Tell me that you weren't with him While i was home taking care of our kids.
Tell me that you didn't sleep with your ex-Husband.
I didn't sleep with him.
I did kiss him, But that's all.
Well, it must have been one hell of a kiss For you to build all these lies around it.
Look, i-I-I promise.
It d-It didn't mean anything.
We were engaged.
It means something to me.
Where are you going? I need time to figure this out, Away from you.
Oh, rufus, please, would you come back home so we can so we can work this out.
Hey.
Hey, vanessa.
It's, uh, it's me.
I haven't heard from you in awhile, So i'm-I'm guessing that means you don't want to hear from me.
Um, but, uh, Well, anyway, things around here aren't- Aren't so great right now.
You know, with my-My dad and lily So i i don't know.
If you get a minute, i- I could use a friend.
I think we're pushing our luck at this point.
Yeah.
We should go now.
Will you grab my jacket and dress, please? Hey, i don't see it.
It's not here.
It's a perfect fit.
Well, i'm glad you're sticking around for a while.
Me, too.
Here.
No.
This wasn't a date.
If you want one, you'll have to ask.
With enough time, eventually we all see What was right in front of us thank you.
Don't mind us.
Oh, great service.
Hey, that-That girl's got my coat.
This was probably the best first date ever.
Promise me no more slow.
Well, what if it's the good kind of slow? And realize no matter how long it took, It was worth the wait.
Are you all right? I spent 18 years Accepting the fact my mother was dead.
I was misguided to let one of my father's girlfriends Allow me to question that, To hope things may be different.
Your real mother would never turn her back On a chance to know you.
I don't have a real mother, blair.
I never will.
That doesn't mean you're alone.
I love you, chuck, And i'll always be your family.
But for some, that time never comes.
Instead of healing old wounds the wait just opens new ones time after time.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, gossip girl.
Gossip girl here.
Your one and only source into the scandalous life of Manhattan elite.
I love you.
Dan.
That's not really the reaction I was hoping for.
What is that? - It's from my father, and it's been opened.
You don't get to judge me ever again.
Tell me that you didn't sleep with your ex-husband.
I did kiss him, but that's all.
You have the wrong idea.
I'm not some sort of trophy husband.
It's okay.
We all sacrifice our independence for love.
You took the wrong boat.
No, actually, this is the one with the cash.
Mine had the "E" in it.
I spent 18 years accepting the fact my mother was dead.
Your real mother would never turn her back on a chance to now you.
I don't have a real mother, Blair.
It doesn't mean you're alone.
I really think that we should try to take this slow.
Yeah, yeah, I was thinking the same thing.
This wasn't a date.
If you want one, you'll have to ask.
Get up and go at it, Upper East Side.
I hear little J.
is having foreign relations with a handsome attach.
We always knew she had friends in high places.
But how low will she go? - What are you even doing here? - You said your stepmom hadn't gotten up before noon all week.
But if she does, - then you'll be spending the day hiding in my closet.
Kinky.
All right, I'll go.
I just wanted to make sure we're still on for tonight.
-Oh, yeah I was thinking Italian.
Maybe Morandi or Il Buco? I mean, if you don't want to go downtown, we could just walk over to Tony's.
Oh, well, not that I don't love popcorn and a movie, - but I mean, it's Saturday night.
I wanted to go out.
We are.
In fact, we have half a dozen deliveries to make - at some parties.
Again? You're the only dealer in town? No rest for the wicked.
I'm gonna have to leave these here for the day if that's cool.
Yeah, okay.
Jenny's drug way station.
I guess that's the one good thing about my parents being in this huge, unexplained fight.
I can think of others.
Hey, don't don't you wanna answer that? No.
Hello, father.
No.
No, I can't this evening.
I have plans.
Just a friend.
Okay.
All right, shall we take care of this? What? Nothing.
Ow.
Since when do you cook? Honestly, I didn't even know we had a fridge until this morning.
Hey, hey, hey, hey! We're not heathens.
Stop.
I told you I was good in the kitchen.
The cocktail olives I could've done without, though.
Not really a breakfast food.
I'm still hungry.
Doesn't Rufus make brunch on Saturdays? I prefer this breakfast.
Oh, God! Oh, God.
Chuck! Of course.
Not to be outdone.
God forbid.
Yes! That's it! God.
Yes! Oh, don't stop! God, Chuck! - Oh, God, that's it! Yeah! - Hello? - Hey, it's me.
Chuck? Oh! Where are you? Early meeting.
Look, I forgot my cell.
Can you stick it in my briefcase? - God, yes! Chuck! Don't stop! Uh - Blair is sort of in there right now.
Which is why I need you to grab it.
She can get curious, - and right now is not a good time.
Oh, God! Yes! Yeah, man.
Uh, will do.
Great.
Yes! God, Chuck! God, Chuck! Yes! - Oh, God, Chuck! - Blair? Yes, right there! Oh! - Haven't you heard of knocking? - I did knock, but you didn't hear me.
We heard you, though.
I'm sorry.
Was it awkward? - Are you trying to prove some kind of point? - Yes.
But I shouldn't have to.
I'm just glad I got Chuck's couch scotchgarded.
Now if you'll excuse me, Louis Vuitton is doing metallic booties for spring.
B.
? S.
? Talk to me.
Tell me what's wrong.
Chuck and I aren't connecting right now.
You mean Not just like that.
But thanks so much for the constant reminder.
Sorry.
He's shutting me out In his head all the time.
Normally, I'd chalk it up to just him being him.
But last week he went through something, and If he's still upset, I just want him to be able to talk to me.
Well, how do you usually pull these things out of him? Pretty much what you just heard, sans fashion magazine.
I've tried all my tricks.
He's not interested.
I just wanna make him feel better.
Hey.
Melissa.
Uh, Dan.
Bit overdressed, aren't we? I have an extra pair of board shorts if you want to join me.
Hit Ocean Drive? Um uh maybe some other time.
Just listen to me.
All right, I I know I screwed up, and I don't blame you for not returning my phone calls.
But I miss you.
And what I said at the hospital, well, I meant it as a friend, - only as a friend.
Dan, it's cool.
You don't have to explain.
No, no, no, no, no, I really do because I I really want things to go back to the way they were.
What do you say? We could hang out today, we could remind ourselves - how normal it can be between us.
Actually, the dorm's throwing - this huge south beach party tonight.
Great, I love parties.
And I'm going with Paul.
I love Paul.
Don't you think the three of us hanging out would be weird? - Weird? - No.
No, I'll bring a date.
What date? Well, if you would've returned any number of my 10,000 phone calls, you would know that I've started seeing someone.
I mean, it's not serious at all, but, uh - Look, it'll be fun and normal.
I promise.
Fine.
The party starts in an hour.
Okay, great.
All right.
Wait.
What's her name? Melissa.
Yeah, her name's Melissa.
It's a good name.
See you soon.
Hi.
Hey, uh, do you know a girl named Melissa? Everybody decent in here? Oh, hey.
Ah.
Got it.
What are you doing? Um, my phone's dead.
I was gonna use Chuck's.
There's a phone in the living room.
I know.
I wanted to check a tweet.
Wait.
Wait, Chuck asked you to grab his phone when he called, - didn't he? - Chuck called? No.
I mean, yeah, he called.
But he just wanted me to put his phone in his briefcase - so he doesn't forget it.
That's it.
Oh, God, I miss that.
What? - Dating someone who's a horrible liar.
So much easier.
Chuck didn't want me to see his phone.
Hand it over, Archibald.
Nate.
There's half a dozen calls from a number I've never seen, and a message.
One, two, three, four, five.
Jenny? I was just going out for a coffee Hi, Lily.
You're up really early.
Uh, you remember Damien, right? He just stopped by.
What is going on here? Or do I even have to ask? Lily, I'm I'm I'm so sorry.
Please, please don't tell my dad.
Please.
I want both of you in the living room now.
You, get dressed.
I shouldn't.
I turned over a new lea a new, non-meddling leaf from the trust tree.
If he want keep secrets, then But he shouldn't.
Something is bothering him, and he's not telling me about it.
What am I supposed to do, right? - Blair, put the phone down, and talk to him when he gets home.
What it's this number.
It's the same number he called me from this morning.
Charles, it's me again.
I know I keep calling, but you haven't returned, and there are things you need to know, things I need to tell you.
I'm still at the Algonquin but I'm checking out today.
I hope you'll change your mind.
Elizabeth Fisher was staying at the Algonquin.
Who's Elizabeth Fisher? - Her name used to be Evelyn, and she's my mother.
And just like that, we get the mother of all questions.
Chuck, how is that even possible? Bart told you your mother died.
He also told me kids wear suits to kindergarten and that blue chip stocks are great for birthday gifts.
He told me what he wanted me to believe.
Chuck ran into a woman at Bart's grave and tracked her down.
She told us she was just one of Bart's friends, but I guess You okay, man? - Why wouldn't I be? - You don't seem excited.
After all this time of thinking your mother is gone, now you have a second chance.
A chance for what? Why even come back? - She's here now.
Who cares why? - I've got a pretty good idea what her motivation is.
Throw this away.
Chuck, no.
Serena, just - You have no idea what happened 20 years ago, why she stayed away.
You have to at least let her explain.
No, I really don't.
I'm going to the bar for a drink.
If you're planning on doing any more sleuthing behind my back, I can leave you the combination for the hotel safe.
He's gonna be fine.
He's being crazy.
What are we gonna do? - Nothing.
You didn't see his face when he confronted this woman, and she sent him away.
He's had enough pain in his life.
If he doesn't wanna hear her story, then I'm gonna respect that, and so will you.
I'm gonna take off.
I don't really feel like playing the scared boyfriend role.
No one's asking you to play the boyfriend role.
Ahh.
Okay, Lily, what's so important that you couldn't tell me over the phone? Well, Jenny had a friend stay over last night, and I thought it would be a good idea for us to talk about it.
Whoo! So how long have you and Vanessa known each other? Oh, we've been best friends since we were kids.
I was actually talking to Paul.
Right.
Of course.
Paul and I met at a cabaret last semester.
And theme was fairy tales, so it's only appropriate - that I met my prince charming.
Actually, Dan was prince charming.
Where did you and Dan meet? - In the hallway, actually.
He Yeah, I was lost.
Uh, this building can be very tricky when you don't live here.
Let's go hit a beach ball around.
Yeah.
Sure.
Are we gonna talk about what's going on here? - More drinks first.
I'm sorry.
But A Blair Waldorf apology without a caveat? Sounds serious.
Which is why I'm here if you wanna talk.
Or if you don't.
Even if she is my mother, she isn't.
It doesn't change anything.
The past belongs to the past.
I think we should go to Bart's grave one last time, drop that of and never look back.
All right.
Where do I even start? How could you let this happen? - I didn't let anything happen.
Jenny is not Serena.
And contrary to popular belief, children need boundaries.
Dad, I - Excuse me, sir.
The truth is, we fell asleep watching TV.
I know that sounds like "teenage excuses for dummies.
" I appreciate the fact that you're a concerned father is remembering when you were a teenage boy.
Pack your bags, young lady.
You're coming with me.
What? Where, dad? I live here.
Not anymore.
It's back to Brooklyn for you.
Dad, you can't do that.
Rufus - Jennifer, pack your bags or I will.
Okay, fine.
I'll do it myself.
Rufus, can we please talk about this? No, Lily, we can't.
You know, while she's packing her stuff, maybe I'll go grab what's left of my own.
Hey.
Hey.
Where's Melissa? Uh, oh, she's salsa dancing.
Paul? She seems nice.
I knew this was gonna be weird.
What are you talking about? - We're not really in a friendship groove here, Dan.
There's too much pressure.
Too much pressure? There's there's no pressure.
What could be friendlier than taking a mock photo? Come on.
Uh photo? Huh? Right.
That was you know, it's it's it's all these mojitos and the confined space and the heat.
Right.
Miami.
Um, so photo? Yeah.
Hey.
We come in peace.
Whatever you need, man, we're here for ya.
We made reservations at Kellari.
Greeks know how to do comfort food.
What do you say? Well, I guess I could use the walk And some food in my system.
You sure we're doing the right thing? It's his mother.
You know Chuck.
He just needs a little push.
Careful, S.
You may think you know what's best, but this time, you might just be pushing your Chuck.
What? Nothing.
O our drinks would be nice, - maybe some bread for the table.
You haven't eaten bread since middle school.
So, buddy, uh, how you holding up? You good? Yeah, I'm fine.
No, it wasn't me.
We we called her.
We think you're making a big mistake, one you'll regret for the rest of your life.
Why not just listen? - That's it.
Let's go.
Blair, you know I'm right.
No matter what he says now, he'll always wonder, and it will eat away at him.
Chuck, she's here now, and she wants to talk to you.
Whatever she has to say, it's better than not knowing.
Fine.
Oh, my God.
I forgot our drinks.
No, Melissa and I already grabbed some.
Oh.
And we got to talking.
He was surprised to find out we just met this morning.
This morning? - Right before you called and told me you wanted to get back together.
Back together? - How do you feel about salsa dancing? - No, no, no.
M Melissa, please.
Wait, Paul.
I I can explain.
Can you just wait one second? - No, no need.
We get it, even if you don't.
And whatever's going on between you two either do something about it or don't do something about it.
But, please, don't bring normal people into whatever this is.
This was a mistake.
I was brought here under false pretenses.
Your friend Serena told me that you know who I am.
"Friend" is a pretty loose term right now.
They're talking.
See? I knew if they got together - Shh! Eat your spanakopita.
I don't know where to start.
If it's all the same to you, - why don't we skip to the end of the story? - I'm I'm sorry? - What's he doing? - Oh, Chuck.
I know why you're here.
Yes, to-to talk.
Really? Well, we'll see how much you want to talk, because I bet it's not as much as this.
She she doesn't want the money.
She she won't take it.
She just wants to talk to him.
I'm going over there.
Serena, sit your ass down.
Wow.
No judgment, no strings attached, but one.
I don't want to know your story.
I want to know you'll leave and never come back.
This is really what you want? I'm sorry, Charles.
You're right.
An expensive lunch, but it was worth it.
By the way, you were wrong.
What are you still doing here? Do you want my dad to kill you? Right.
Well, I assume you're not leaving without these.
I will be taking these, but I actually came to say goodbye.
Okay.
Well, goodbye friend.
That's what you called me on the phone to your dad, right? - So? So I'm getting exiled to Brooklyn because of our relationship, and I don't even know if we have one.
Jenny You're in high school.
Your father's not completely out of line.
Okay.
Hey.
You know, wait a second.
I'm not gonna go write your name in a heart on my binder, okay? But you cannot expect me to start world war III with my dad without even giving me something to fight for.
What difference does it make? - Your father won't let you see me again.
Okay, now who's in high school? I fight with my dad all the time.
Last year I ran away.
I'm I'm not afraid to stand up to him.
Jenny? Jenny, what are you doing? Jenny.
Whose are these? They're mine.
Watch your step, little J.
Damien may be your drug of choice, but it looks like this love could be bad medicine.
Look, I can explain.
Oh, believe me, you will Right now.
Did you know about this? No, Rufus, I did not know about a giant bag of pills.
Jenny, what are you doing? I may be a bitch, but I'm not a little bitch.
I told you I wasn't afraid.
Are you taking these or selling them? I want the truth.
They're for a friend.
Jenny, please don't make this worse.
Okay, I don't get what the big deal is.
I know you didn't spend all those years on the tour bus reading.
There's a huge difference between sharing a joint with my bassist and getting caught with a sack full of narcotics.
This is serious, Jenny.
Okay.
So let's just get it over with then.
Am I grounded for life? Military school? What? Probably both.
This goes way past that, Jenny.
See, I look at you and I don't see my daughter anymore.
The drugs don't belong to Jenny.
They're mine.
Actually, they're my father's.
Chuck.
Chuck, wait.
You were looking for a fairy-tale ending.
Next time rent a movie.
Leave me out of I.
I just wanted him to have answers.
Please.
You and I both know why you did this, and it has nothing to do with Chuck.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I should go.
Hey, I'll go with you.
Nate, I need to be alone right now.
What do you mean, it had nothing to do with Chuck? Sorry, Nate.
Vanessa, hey.
We need to talk about this.
What? - Our our kiss.
What's there to discuss? We both had about five too many mojitos.
Why did you lie to me about dating Paul? Because I knew you had feelings for me, and I didn't want things to be awkward between us.
And if I was dating Paul, then you wouldn't get your hopes up.
Oh, come on, Vanessa, don't - No, don't get all Dan Humphrey on me.
Melissa? Really? - All right, fine.
Y fine.
Fine.
It's clearly not my best plan.
And I I shouldn't have lied to you either, but I was trying to protect our friendship.
I didn't want you to feel weird around me.
That stopped being an option the minute you old me you had feelings for me.
I wish you'd never done that.
I think I need another mojito.
I'm I'll I'll see you around.
So after my mother left, uh, I thought my father just wanted to have a good time, but, of course, you know, it escalated, and he started going on these benders.
One day he disappeared for two days.
I thought he was dead.
And, uh, you didn't tell anyone? - I had no one to tell.
I mean, my mother certainly wasn't an option.
Then he came back in, filthy, with a broken arm and no recollection of what had happened.
Oh, my God.
The good news was I think it scared him enough that he got sober.
And I got my father back, or least I thought I did, until I saw these this morning in his room.
That's when I came over here, to see Jenny.
Jenny's really been her for me lately.
And wile we're clearing the air, I want you to know I didn't spend the night in your home last night.
Jenny was just trying to protect me.
By letting me believe that Damien slept here? I was trying to distract you from seeing the pills.
Yeah, I I still don't understand why you brought the drugs over.
I know it was completely reckless, and I'm sorry for putting you and Jenny in that position.
I I just thought I if I got the pills away from my dad that everything would be okay.
I'm sorry.
Do you want to talk? Or No talking.
Well, that was certainly a crazy story.
Where'd you get that, "intervention"? I I mean, it sounded so real.
They totally bought it.
Yeah, there's nothing to buy.
It's it's true Oh, Damien, they're upstairs.
They can't hear you.
Except for the part about my dad getting sober.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.
No one does.
I'd leave except I feel like if I disappear, he'd have absolutely no reason to ever come home.
I'm really glad you told me.
Well, the pills have been flushed.
It's time for Damien to go, and us, too, Jenny.
Just be happy you have a father who actually cares what you do.
Thanks, dad.
I really liked Damien, and he liked me.
You're young.
You'll get over it.
Get your suitcase.
Elizabeth? I'm sorry.
I I need to leave.
Can I just have a moment of your time, please? Charles was pretty clear about his feelings.
It's not for him.
It's for me.
Well, S.
, looks like Chuck's mom isn't the only one with baggage.
My dad left when I was a little girl.
I don't know when or if I'll ever know why.
But I want to know why you left.
I know it must not be easy, but I don't think you would have come back if you didn't want to tell your story.
I I was 19 when I got pregnant, nowhere near ready to be a mother.
We agreed I'd give the baby up for adoption.
But I saw a picture of you holding Chuck in the locket.
You you couldn't go through with it? No.
It was Bart who couldn't go through with it.
Once he saw his son, that was it.
He even asked me to marry him.
You weren't married? Oh, no.
And I wasn't about to be.
I didn't love him.
I told him that.
So he blackmailed you then, told you that if you left, you'd never see your son? I'm the one who told him to tell Charles I was dead.
It was the only way I knew that he'd never come looking for me.
And that way I could go on with my life as if he never happened.
But you must have had regrets.
And and knowing Bart, he wouldn't have made it easy to come back.
Right? Bart sent me money every year to keep me away.
But truth is, he didn't have to.
I didn't doubt my decision.
I know This wasn't what you were hoping to hear, but now you know why it's better if I just leave.
My son wants to hate me.
I don't blame him.
You know, I've I've known Chuck my whole life, and he's better than anyone I know at pushing people away.
I don't care what he says or does, but there's no child that doesn't want to know their parent.
Dan.
Can I talk to you for a sec? Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Look, you're right.
I lied to you about Paul and then kissed you because I have feelings for you.
I'm scared, because I don't want to ruin our friendship.
And neither do I.
We're in this no-man's-land.
We aren't hooking up right now because we want to stay friends, - but we aren't friends right now because we want to hook up.
No one is really winning in this scenario.
It's like we're being so cautious that we're ruining everything.
We're hurting our friendship by-by not hooking up.
I think we should just throw down and see what happens.
If we go up in flames at least we know we burned trying.
I'm scared.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I know that I'm probably grounded until I go to college, but please, is there any way - that Damien can have visitation rights? - I understand that you like Damien, Jenny, - but you can't see him anymore.
Dad You lied to us to protect this boy.
And whatever's happening in his home life You know, I can't have you spending time with someone mixed up with drugs.
Lily, please.
You get it, right? - Jenny, I'm sorry.
Your father is right.
Okay, you're just taking dad's side - 'cause you guys are in a fight.
This has nothing to do with Lily and me.
Really? Because Lily's sleeping till noon every day, and you're spending your time hiding at the loft.
So just because you finally found something that you guys can agree on, - it doesn't mean that you're right.
Where are you going? I'll be waiting for you downstairs.
Let's just get this over with.
I wish you and Jenny would just stay here, and we could work through this as a family.
Jenny needs a break from this world.
She needs to be back in her old room, her feet on solid ground.
And I think I need that, too, at least for a while.
I'm sorry for not telling you about Elizabeth calling.
I wasn't trying to shut you out.
Then what was it? I was hoping I could find out who she was without ever knowing why she did what she did.
Writing the check was just a test.
But I wanted her to pass, not fail.
As soon as I handed it to her, I didn't want her to take it.
Mm.
It's the front desk.
Hello? Okay, Patricia, hold on.
Elizabeth Fisher is in the lobby.
She wants to come up.
All right, you ready to go? Jenny? Jenny? There comes a time when every father learns you can't keep a bad girl down.
Nate, what are you doing here? Well, I thought you'd be here.
Where'd you go? Um, I went to see Chuck's mother.
Why? Because of my dad.
I've been trying to find him.
I just want to talk to him, to understand why he left.
I've come close to finding him.
I I tracked him down last summer.
But, um, he didn't want to see me, and he wrote me a letter explaining.
He was with my mother.
So that's why you've been avoiding your mom.
And I felt like somehow h his letter meant something.
You know? But the truth is, he knows who I am now, and he hasn't come to find me.
I think talking to Elizabeth made me finally realize that he just doesn't want to be found.
Why didn't you tell me any of this? Well Things have been so good with us, so fun.
I didn't want to bring any heaviness into it, you know, ruin things.
Yeah, I mean, this time has been incredible.
I mean, we broke my dresser.
And I'm enjoying every minute of it.
I just I want to be that person you can bring anything to, the good and the bad.
Me, too.
Did you ever think that maybe If that's the way your father feels, he's not worth finding? I know it's probably not the story you wanted to hear, but I wanted you to know the truth.
And I thought my father was the heartless one.
Chuck.
You have every right to hate me.
But I want to be in your life.
For a price, of course.
I don't want this.
I thought it would be better if you could hate me, but I think it's better if you know me.
I've decided to stay in new York.
I'm willing to wait as long as it takes.
I want to know my son.
Wait.
It seems like all that money Should at least buy you a drink.
I was worried that it wasn't gonna be as good without Olivia.
Yeah, it's almost like she brought us down, I I would say, - if I had to grade us.
"A" minus? All right.
Well, I was gonna say "a" plus.
Well, minus for the first time, due to the elbow incident, but after that, plus.
Plus, plus, plus.
The reason, um, I was freaked out when you told me how you felt was because with us, it feels like it's all or nothing.
Yeah, I know.
If we hooked up, then it puts everything in fast-forward.
Like we'd have to be married - before graduation.
All of our friends would be getting their first STDs, and we'd be celebrating our first wedding anniversary.
So let's just take it one day at a time? Keep being friends? Yeah.
As long as we can keep doing this.
You're gonna be in a lot of trouble.
Yeah.
Well, you'd better make my punishment worth it.
So my dad might have flushed your stash, but I raided Lily's medicine cabinet.
She sometimes gets headaches.
It's a hell of a headache.
Yeah.
I figured we could go to the party and you could maybe sell those instead.
Or We could skip the party.
And do what? Rufus? No, miss Lily.
It's me.
Is that Rufus' scarf? It was turned in, lost and found.
He wasn't wearing it today.
I did not want to say this, but Dorota insist.
Miss Holland say Uh, Rufus left this at her apartment.
I'm sure he was just down there talking about rooftop garden.
Thank you, Vanya.
I'm sure that was it.
Hey.
It's me.
Serena.
I still don't know if this is your number, but I wanted you to know that I'm not looking for you anymore.
I thought maybe you wanted to know me.
But now it's me that doesn't want to know you.
I'm done.
See you tomorrow.
Enjoy your talk.
Call me in the morning.
Thank you.
I will.
Spotted Chuck Bass breaking bread with his mother.
Looks like our little boy lost is finally found What do you want to know? Everything.
For now, at least.

Chuck had an emergency meeting with his lawyer, But he hoped we could all meet up for some shopping later.
That sounds lovely.
This has been a wonderful week.
Chuck thinks so, too.
He mentioned what a great squash player you were.
And he likes a woman who knows her way around a haberdashery.
Actually i think there's something he wants to ask you.
Call when you're in the lobby.
Are you okay? Several female employees at the empire are suing me for sexual harassment.
What? Obviously there were incidents with room service at the palace, But that was my father's hotel.
I was a kid.
I would never do that now, not in my hotel, not to you.
No.
Of course not.
They're scheming harlots Trying to get you to pay thef.
We have proo that two of those girl Weren't even in town on one of the alleged nights.
So we'll fight it.
Weave innocence, good breeding and doug jarrett, One of the best lawyers in new york, on our side.
It's a slam dunk.
A court case would be a p.
R.
Nightmare.
We ave to settle.
You'll take care of it? Settlements are for the guilty- Celebrities who run people over, the catholic church.
It's not fair.
The historical society is honoring my father tonight.
I can't have this overshadowing the evening Or anything else.
This way, the case will be sealed.
The press won't know.
No one will.
Elizabeth wouldn't have believed it, chuck.
That's not why i'm doing this.
But if it was, i'd understand.
You like her.
You want the first time She meets lily and the rest of your family to be perfect.
What is the point of having elizabeth in your life If you're not going to let her in? Not everyone's willing to wait Lily, what are you doing here? I'm just checking in.
How are things going with jenny? Oh, we have an understanding- She goes to school, she comes home mm.
She does not date boys with bags of pills.
Oh, i'm sure she's furious.
The hulk was furious.
There's no word for what jenny is.
Rufus, i need to ask you something.
One sec, lil.
Headmistress queller, hi.
I see.
Thank you for calling.
Jenny didn't go to school this morning.
Apparently, she's been cutting classes all week.
Who needs coffee after a wake-Up like that? Who's texting this early? Rufus.
He's freaking out.
He can't find jenny.
He thinks she's with damien.
This is not good.
Who, prince damien from the state dinner? I thought you thght he was dreamy.
Well, that was before he tried to kiss me After i told him not to.
Um, what? And now that creep's with enny? Yeah.
You know what's most attractive about a bad boy? No, i really don't.
Your parents refusing to let you see him.
Rufus is driving jenny right into damien's creepy arms.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Your dad has called, like, five times.
He's obviously looking for you.
I know.
I'm just not sure i want to explain where i've been.
We agreed if this is gonna work, We gotta- We gotta keep it casual.
If my dad knows, then it's suddenly gonna feel serious, And you know how bad i am at lying to him.
You can't avoid him forever.
Hey, dad.

  What? Oh, um, it's-It's 9
0.
I have latin.
It's a dead language.
It's not gong anywhere.
Why don't you just ditch it and stay here with me? I can't.
I have a quiz.
Come on, jenny.
Don't you think it's a little coincidental The last time we got to this exact same spot- You know, the place right underneath your kilt- That you had to go dissecfetal pig? I did.
Come on, damien.
You know i want to be here.
Jenny.
Why don't we just talk about it? What's there to talk about? I think you're an amazing girl.
I love spending time with you.
But when i date someone, s*x is usually part of the equation, And if you're not cool with that, it's fine, But you need to say something.
You can't just shut me down every time we're alone together.
I'm not.
I it's just not a good ay.
I mean, i have a quiz, and then i have that other class.
You're younger than me.
I get it.
Could it be that you've never No.
Damien.
It's not like that.
Look, i just don't like the first time with someone To be rushed.
And ve school.
Okay.
Well, how about tonight? After your father goes to sleep, we can sneak out.
No rush, okay? Nice and slow.
Yeah.

I should hope so.
Prince william and i Practically put the manager's daughter through college.
Well, i had a lovely time.
Actually, there's something That chuck has been meaning to ask you.
The historical society is Dedicating a gallery to bart tonight.
I understand it might be awkward for you to go to an event Where my father's being honored.
Lily would be there and - I'd love to come.
Charles, is is why i'm here.
I want to be s much a part of your life as you'll let me.
Mr.
Bass! Mr.
Bass, did you pay off women you sexually harassed? Did you receive s*x in exchange for promotions? Is it true? Look, this is e.
I'll explain later.
Somebody must have laked the story.
Let's just go.
Let's go.
I should have guessed.
Naughty nephew.
Uncle jack.
You won't believe what i just heard.
I'm shocked.
Yeah, i'm sure you are.
She's a teenage girl.
Cutting school to be with her boyfriend Isn't exactly criminal behavior.
I guess i'm still holding out hope That somewhere underneath that mop of blond hair Is my little girl.
I know.
Thanks for being here.
Oh, i'm glad i could be.
And i'm willing to put the past in the past if you are.
Rufus, we just need to talk.
Now? Well, the new york historicl society Is dedicating a room to bart tonight.
I was hoping you could join me.
Lil, i think this morning Has been a step in the right direction.
But i'm not quite in the mood to celebrate Any of your former husbands right now.
I'm gonna go try to get ahold of serena again.
Hey, serena.
Have you heard from her yet? Thanks for texting me.
Of course.
Parents can be such a pain.
See, if he wasn't so controlling and judgmental, Then i wouldn't have to be sneaking around like this.
No, i-I get it.
You're 16.
You should be able to date who you want.
Exactly.
So how are things with damien? They're great.
Um, he listens to me, And he-He treats me like an adult And really likes me.
I've never felt this way before.
So it-It's serious then? Well, it's about to be.
He's, uh, stayin at the smyth hotel, And i was thinking that tonight - Tonight? Uh, i'd say that is serious then.
Your first time- Tat's-That's monumental.
It is your first time, right? Are you nervous? Yeah, i guess a littl.
Jenny, the thing about your virginity Is that you can never get it back.
You know, i i always kinda wish I- I would've waited For somebody that would have stood up for me And fought for me, You know, like patrick swayze in "dirty dancing.
" "Dirty dancing"? It's great.
You should downloait.
All right.
But, see, the thing is, serena, That damien really is the right guy.
Okay, well, that's your decision, and i'll support you.
Uh, you know what? Obviously, you're not going to school today, And you should-Should commemorate today, so i have to get readyfor chuck's, But nate will take you to lunch.
Yeah.
I, um, what are you in the mood for? There he is.
I would have been here sooner, But i got distracted reading some of those protestors' signs.
I never realized how many s*x puns you could make Out of the name "chuck bass.
" Don't worry.
It'll blow over in a couple weeks.
You expect me to believe it's just coincidence You show up te same time this lawsuit does? I came back to protect you.
See, i heard a rumor- Evelyn bass rose from the dead.
Oh, she wasn't dead.
No, it seems my father paid her To stay away from me all these years.
Yeah.
I get why you'd fall for all this, What, with your mommy issues, All those abnormal attachments to your babysitters.
Didn't help that i was nailing 'em, huh? But, chuck, i saw evelyn's bod in the casket At the funeral home.
And why should i believe anything you say? I tell you what.
Have her come by the party tonight.
The old evelyn and i never got along.
Maybe now we'll hit it off.
It might be fun.
I've never seea ghost before.
Well, hello, gorgeous.
And now it all makes sense.
You're the blood-Sucking reptile behind this lawsuit.
Wow.
Harsh words.
But i'm innocent.
Whoever did this is more brilliant than i am.
My sources tell me reservations are already down 20%.
You're a lying ooze.
Little nephew is going to have to step down From his beloved empire.
And what? You think you'll somehow get it? Please.
That'll never happen.
Blair.
I've already had everything of chuck's worth having.
And as always, The pleasure is yours.
Trust me.
I have a plan.
Telling jenny that damien is bad for her Will only make her want him more.
We have to show her.
And how-How are we gonna do that? J called him and invited him over for lunch.
What, are you crazy? You said the last time you were alone with that guy, H tried to rip your clothes off.
And he'll try to again, but this time, you and jenny Are gonna walk in rigt in time to catch him.
This-This sounds absurd.
Blar and chuck do it all the time.
Nate, i know it's not ideal, but jenny's gonna have s*x With him tonight if we don't stop this.
We should just call fus.
What, so he can ground her again? Nate, this is gonna work.
It's 1:00 now.
Give me 45 minutes exactly.
Bye.
I'm so glad you called.
You know what, dad? I think every girl Goes through a forbidden guy phase.
It's you know, it explains why vampires are So popular right now.
Well, if he were a vampire, i could slip garlic In her waffles, not that she'd eat them.
Hey, distract me.
I have, uh, noticed You've been sleeping out quite a bit this week.
Yeah, yeah.
Just at vanessa's, you know.
I fall asleep on the extra bed sometimes, studying late.
It's no big deal.
You always were a bad liar.
Obviously, you're seeing someone.
Okay.
All right, you got me.
Um, it's actually, uh, - Vanessa.
Thank you so much for coming by.
Mm.
Ah.
I know i'm overreacting, But i just need family by my side, And i know you're practically jenny's sister.
No, vanessa's not family.
She's not a sister.
She's a-Sh's a friend.
She's a classmate, really, you know.
Hello.
Hey.
What's-What's going on? What are you doing? Rufus is in the other room.
All right, you know what? I think we need To set some guielines.
Guidelines? Well, you know, zones.
Zones where we're friends only, Zones where we're friends with benefits.
And here, where-Where my dad treats you like his own daughter And we've prepared thanksgiving dinner while watching "The sound of music," that's gotta be- I think that's gotta be a friend-Only zone.
Okay.
I see your point.
And lily's, you know, the upper east side in general, Actually, that's a friends-Onl zone, too.
Uh, but downtown, You know, around school, that's friends-With-Benefits zone.
I'll draw you a map.
That's what i'll o.
It'll be much easier.
Sorry to drag you guys all the way over here, But i-I thinhave it handled.
See you later.
I am gonna gck to school.
Okay, you know, i'll come with you.
We can talk about what zone the subway is.
How about the subway is A no-Talking-About-Zone-Rules zone, okay? Better yet, classmate, A sitting-On-Opposite-Ends- Of-The-Car zone.
All right.
Still drawing a map.
You know, i've almost called you a million times.
Really? And why is that? To apologize.
The state dinner- My behavior was- Yeah, well, um, i actually wanted to apologize, too.
Uh, i used you, And-And that was wrong.
But, um, nate and i are over.
Uh, i have absolutely no feelings for him anymore.
Serena, i'm dating jenny, And i actually really like her, So i can't do this.
What? - Great lunch.
Sorry about Nate.
Me, too.
Nate, what's going on? We've had coffee and two entire desserts.
Can we go now? Uh-Oh.
Looks like this virgin queen's next accessory May be a chastity belt.
You're onna dream of the daysyo.
From now, on i will escort you to and from school, Queller will assign someone to walk you from class to class, And you will have lunch in her office.
Dad, i ditched class to be with my boyfriend.
So what? It's not like it's affecting my grades.
You can't keep treating me like a child.
Well, you certainly are acting like one.
If you think this guy- The one that brought drugs into the house- Is right for you, you're a child.
Yeah, and if you would listen to him, Then you'd know that they weren't his pills.
But you didn't.
You just jumped to conclusions, Like you always do.
You know, it's no wonder That you're marriage is going down the toilet.
Hi.
I bought you a little something to wear tonight.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Blair helped me pick it out.
As i recall, purple was your father's favorite color, too.
Actually, i only wear purple Because my father loathed it.
Or maybe that's what he wanted you to think.
Bart was playing with people's heads all the time.
Are you all right? Is it the lawsuit? Not the lawsuit, But, uh, who may be behind it.
My uncle jack just arrived in town.
Sounds like jack.
Will he be going to the party tonight? Uh, he's not invited, but he is a cockroach, And they tend to slip in through the cracks.
Charles, um your uncle and i we have history.
It's ugly history.
Look, i'm not going to let jack Determine who can and can't come to my party.
I'm sorry, charles.
I don't know if i have the strength To deal with him and meet your family at the same time I hope you understand.
I understand perfectly.
But since i can't spend the evening with you, Stay for a while.
Have a drink.
Of course.
I can see he's starting to doubt himself.
Why wouldn't he, with the bad press, the protestors? The "daily intel" says he's thinking of stepping down.
Chuck's not stepping anywhere.
Ooh, can i borrow that? Yeah.
Oh, and speaking of things we've shared nate, serena doesn't want to talk to you right now.
Well, did she tell you about her little plan to seduce damien - And have jenny walk in on it? - Well, it sounds perfectly reasonable to me.
Yeah, because it's a blair-Waldorf-Nut-Job plan.
I'll ignore that.
Nate, serena and i are getting ready for the party.
Now why don't you just apologize so we can all move past this And be supportive for chuck on his big night? No, i'm not going to apologize.
I did the right thing, okay? Serena may not get it, But losing her virginity is a huge deal For a girl like jenny.
Oh, and it wasn't for me? Why is that, nate? Because i was a huge slut when i was jenny's age? Look, i didn't realize i was on speakerphone, okay? I didn't mean to say that.
That's exactly what you meant.
"Dirty dancing"? Yeah, it's corny, but it's kinda good.
Come on.
It's totally good.
Yeah, baby's dad's an even bigge jerk than you.
Look, i have to go to this historical society thing To talk to lil.
Obviously, i can't let you out of my sight, So that means you're coming, too.
But i will be watching you all night.
Great.
Boycott! Boycott! Boycott! Pathetic! Suburban moralists in mom jeans.
I'd pity them if i wasn't scared they'd spill orange soda On my christian louboutins.
What are you doing Are you kidding? A d.
N.
A.
Sample? You've been watching too much cbs.
I should have thougt of it weeks ago.
A friend of mine at the nypd Says he can have it done in a few hours.
This way we'll know once and fo.
You know who she really is.
You can see it in her eyes- In your eyes.
Jack's gotten inside your head.
He has a point.
She turns up out of the blue, Doesn't know things about my father.

  Jnd when she hears that jack
The only person who actually met my mother- Will be at the party tonight, she bails.
Blair, she's supposed to be dead.
Elizabeth.
I was coming to tell you i changed my mind.
Chuck wasn't thinking.
I thought you were starting to open your heart to me, Like i was tu.
Chuck's not doing this.
It's just a big misunderstanding.
Look, if you are who you say you are, You won't mind me doing a d.
N.
A.
Test, right? I should have known you would never let me in.
You are your father's son.
We can drop it off on the way.
I think i'll just meet you there.
Looks like the protestors outside Aren't the only ones who think bass is an ass.
Well, i didn't expect to see you here.
You haven't returned any of my calls in weeks.
I'm here to support chuck.
Serena, i know that you are angry, And maybe someday you'll understand Why i didn't tel you i was- Doing my father when i came to visit him? Well, that's- Save your lies for your current husband.
I have a feeling you're to thank for the, uh, turnout tonight.
Well, people are here because they support you.
None of us believe slander.
Well, thank you.
That means more to me than you know.
Did you come here alone? I thought you would bring blair And maybe someone else that you wanted me to meet.
I'm solo tonight.
Me, too.
Thank you.
Hey.
I didn't mean it the way it sounded.
What, that i was the concubine of the upper east side? Well, look, i didn't want to get into details in front of blair, But, come on, serena.
I mean, everyone knows the stories about adam handler, Uh, jake hendrickson, matt price Oh, the art teacher from prague.
I didn't sleep with all of those guys, nate.
Haven't you heard of locker-Room gossip? They lied or exaggerated.
Serena, i lost my virginity to you On a bar at the campbell apartment.
And somehow that reflects poorly on me and not you? Talk about a double standard.
No that's not what i was talking about.
Look, whatever your twisted guy logic is, There's still no reason for you to go behind my back with jenny.
Serena, i woke up the morning after i lost my virginit To find that the person i lost it to- The person i loved- Had left town, Never to be heard from again for a year.
So, yeah, i had a good reason.
Thank you, for coming.
Arnold, great to see you.
You look glorious, as always.
How dare you show your face At an event you know my wife is at.
Rufus, don't blow a gasket.
I just came to offer my apology.
Lily, i wasn't myself that night at te opera gala.
I'd had a lot to drink, Took some of those over-The-Counter pills They started keeping behind the counter recently And some meth.
Really, i was just in a bad place, But now i'm a changed man.
You expect us to buy that? It was worth a shot.
I'm not gonna make a scene, But if you so much as show up within 50 feet Of this woman again tonight, you're gonna regret it So i guess you found the scarf.
Can we go somewhere private to talk? Great.
Another lecture? Come on.
Did the upper east side crown Cut off the circulation to your brain? Damien's my boyfriend.
Jenny, you're 16.
Come on.
Yeah, and when you were 16, you were n love with serena, And everyone thought it was adorable.
Uh, you know what? Just.
6.
I'll-I'll be right back.
Stay here.
Hey, dan.
How are you? You look amazing.
Is is a friends-Only zone.
I thought we agreed.
Well, that's-That's not a friends-Only dress.
Really? I-I thought it was perfect.
My bad.
Oh, and-And just so you know, I'm not wearing any underwear.
Go away, traitor.
Look, i'm sorry i called rufus, But it was for your own good.
I mean, you're a really special girl, jenny, Who deserves a guy who's gonna see that, You know, who's gonna be there in the morning.
Not like you're available.
Jenny, damien got aggressive with serena at the state dinner.
Shows what you know.
Damien only hit on serena to get her To take off the opera jacket with the drugs in it.
Drugs? Is he dealing? Yocan't be with someone who's dealing drugs.
Why? It's not like you've never done any.
Stop pretending that you care about me.
 and he'll tell judith  In fact, the only one who does just got here.
Hi.
How you doing? - Good.
How are you? I'm sorry, man.
There's no way i'm letting you leave with her.
Really? Let's get out of here.
Damien.
Looks like little j.
Is about to do Some dirty dancing of her own.
Nate.
Hey, you okay? - Yeah.
What happened? It's jenny.
She ran off with damien.
The guy's a drug dealer.
What? - Yeah.
He's staying at the smyth.
Okay.
All right, i'm gonna call you when i find 'em.
Where are my mom and rufus? So i went to holland's.
I don't know what i thought would happen.
But i guess a part of me wanted to even the score.
But when the time came, i couldn't go through with it, Because the truth is, uh, i love you, lily, And i couldn't do that to you.
I love you.
I've always loved you.
Dad.
Jey ran off with damien, and he's worse than we thought.
Oh, god.
Doug.
Don't give me that lawyer face.
People still showed up tonight.
Things can't be that bad.
Actually things have taken a turn.
We're getting attacked by christian conservatives.
We have those in manhttan? The family travel council's organizing a boycott.
You'd be shocked how much influence they have.
That's the kind of thing That would only entice my target clientele.
I don't think the business has The luxury of waiting around to see.
I'm sorry, chuck.
For p.
R.
, if nothing else, It needs to seem that you're no longer in charge.
You need to hand over operations of the hotel, At least temporarily.
Perhaps a family member i'll do it.
Doug.
Give us a moment.
I promise you, jack that wil never happen.
Then i'll wait.
And when your beloved hotel is bankrupt and empty, I'll swoop in and give you fair-Market price.
I'm sure there's some copper pipes i could salvage.
This was your plan, wasn't it? No.
But i'm totally gonna reap its rewards.
You took what was mine.
Now i'm gonna take what's yours.
At least you know it's staying in the family.
What room is damien dalgaard in? I'm sorry, sir.
I can't give out that information.
Would you like me to call up? Well, i seriously doubt he's gonna answer the phone, Considering he's up there alone with a 16-Year-Old girl.
Oh, my gosh.
Thanks for showing up tonight And risking the wrath of my dad, Punching nate freaking archibald.
Let me give you a real reason to thank me.
Right under their noses booking a room at the empire was genius.
You sure you wanna do this? Yeah.
I told you there'd be a new scandal before the day was out.
But we can talk about that later.
What's wrong? A boycott.
Doug sayi have no choice But to sign my hotel over to someone else.
Jack nominated himself.
Of course he did.
I can take over.
I don't think signing the hotel over To my 19-Year-Old girlfriend would ease the public's mind.
What aboutily? - She's bass industries.
The last thing i want is my father's company bailing me out.
I don't see what choice you have.
The d.
N.
A.
Results.
What do tey say Looks like i've got another choice.
Damien, um, There's something that you should know before what is it? You can tell me anything.
I'm a virgin.
I just wanted you to know - In case - I just wanted you to know.
I kinda figured.
It's really not a big deal.
Well actually, i mean, it is it is kind of a big deal for me.
I mean i chose you, and that it means something to me.
Does it jenny, why don't we talk about this after? Okay? No, i don't- I don't want to do this.
Damien, where- Where are you going? I knew you were just a kid.
Well, the police are looking into it, But they don't seem optimistic That they're gonna find them tonight.
They're not at the hotel.
There was nothing any one of us could have done.
Jenny's mind was set.
Everyone will be happy to know that damien and i broke up.
Jenny, i'm sorry for you, but that's what happens- Whatever, dad.
Am i still grounded? Yes.
Okay.
I'll just, um, Stay at home for the rest of the year.
All right, now i'm really tired, So if it's okay with you, i'd just like to go to my room.
Hey.
You okay? I'm fine.
That's a relief.
So then you and damien didn't - No, we did.
Honestly, serena, i don't know what you were so worried about.
It was no big deal.
Would you min closing the door on your way out? I shoul have trusted you.
The test came back? It's hard for me to let people in.
I abandoned you when you were just a baby.
How could it not be? I want to change.
I want to trust you.
I need to, Because i need someone to take over operations of my hotel For a while.
What? It's mostly just a signing authority.
I'd still have a voice behind the scenes.
It just needs to look like i'm gone, Until the scandal subsides.
Charles, it's-It's too much There are other people who'd do a better job.
I don't trust those other people.
Those other people aren't my mother.
Look, it's not hard.
I'll show you everything you need to know.
You just have to sign these papers.
Hello, mother.
Lily, it's been six months.
I'm afraid it's time We check back in with the good dr.
Van der woodsen.
Can't we get someone else to do the tests? I mean, does it really have to be him? You know he's the right choice, And it's been too long already.
Please, darling.
For me.
Okay.
I'll get on the next plane out.
Thank you, dear.
Lil? Hey.
Everything okay? Actually, that was my mother, And she is at canyon ranch.
And normally, i could ignore her pleas, but- You should go.
I think jenny and i need some time right now anyway.
Maybe when you come back, you and i can start all over.
I would love that.
Clean slate.
Absolutely.
Clean slate.
So, uh, so, listen, I know your room is a benefits-Only zone but, uh, right now i-I need to talk to my friend.
Fine.
I'll make an exception.
Shoot.
Well, you see, there's this girl, And-And under normal circumstances I'd tell everyone, "hey, everybody.
"I'm seeing this amazing girl.
I think it might be serious.
" But this girl and i- We agreed that that would be a mistake.
Interesting.
The thing is, keeping these feelings aside Is-Is-Is killing me, 'cause all i want to do is Tell everyone how happy i am.
How happy are you? Oh, i'm very, very happy, very happy, The kind of happy that people write embarrassing songs about.
Then, as your friend, i think you should tell people And as long as this is still a benefits-Only zone I'm sorry i didn't tell you i was callinfus.
No, it's okay.
My plan was dumb anyway.
Nate, i i'm really sorry i left the morning after we you know, i never meant to hurt you.
Oh, i know.
I wish that somehow, we could relive that night, Because this time i know that you lov me, And you know that i love you.
What are we celebrating? Te lawsuit? The scandal? The fact i just signed over my hotel? We're celebrating you opening your heart to your mother And me being the woman who encouraged you to do it.
And just like that chuck bass celebrating a new love.
Well? Do we have ourselves a hotel? We do.
Creful, Chuck.
It's an open heart That's vulnerable to the deepest wound.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, gossip girl.
Gossip Girl, here.
Your one and only source into the scandalous life of Manhattan's ellite.
I can't have you spending time with someone messed up with drugs.
Everyone'll be happy to know that Damien and I broke up.
You touch this dress, you'll never set foot in here again.
You should do your own clothing line.
I can model them.
You can totally do this.
I had no idea you'd be such a little thief.
Agnes, give me my dresses! What are you doing?! Keeping these feelings aside is-is killing me, 'cause all I wanna do is tell everybody how happy I am.
I think you should tell people.
I want to be as much a part of your life as you'll let me.
I need someone to take over operations of my hotel.
There are other people who'd do a better job.
Those other people aren't my mother.
Do we have ourselves a hotel? We do.
Gossip Girl 3 Episode 16 - - The Empire Strikes Jack - Tthey say the clothes make the man, but who makes the clothes? on the Upper East Side, it's Eleanor Waldorf, and we hear her new line is to die for.
So, uh, where are we going? I thought everyone was coming over for brunch.
It's the first since you moved back to Lily's.
Jen, as hard as it is for me to admit, there are some things more important in life than waffles.
And I'm not gonna let you spend another day sulking in that apartment.
Okay, well, you grounded me.
And I won't be able to unground you until I know you're okay.
That's why we're going to Eleanor's.
Wait.
What? I was talking to Serena, and she said that Eleanor is having something called a pop-up fashion show for her new junior line.
So I called Eleanor and asked her if you could help out.
Dad, the last time I worked for Eleanor, it didn't exactly end well.
Remember? But I also remember that my daughter used to love working in fashion.
Listen, just give it a shot.
Your room's not going anywhere.
This isn't so bad, is it? Thanks, dad.
I'll see you at home tonight, after the show.
There's something about waking up on the day of a fashion show.
The smell of fresh pleats wafting through the city Nothing quickens your blood quite like couture.
Ride with me uptown? My mother would love to see you for breakfast.
I have a breakfast with my mother.
I'm so proud of you for opening up to Elizabeth.
She earned my trust, and I, hers.
And she seems to be faring well at the helm of the mighty empire? Oh, she's a natural.
Have a perfect day.
Oh.
Nothing says luxury quite like your own private army.
Victor, is everything all right? Mr.
bass, you need to vacate the premises immediately.
I think you've misunderstood.
I may have put my mother in charge for the time being, but I'm not leaving the hotel.
Actually, sir, these orders come from her.
My, look who's risen from the dead.
I just wanted to say thank you so much for this opportunity.
And I've really learned a lot since the last time we worked together, and I won't let you down.
Well, despite our troubled past, as I told your father, I am a firm believer in second chances, so I even rehired your friend.
Jenny.
Agnes? Uh, hi.
How are you? - 90 days sober in a.
A.
Good for you.
Now come on, Jenny.
What are you waiting for? Get Agnes fitted, Hmm? I like to see my elves busy.
Clock's tickin'.
You ready? 'Cause this is it.
Mm.
I'm ready.
It's time.
We're just gonna go in and tell them we're dating.
Exactly.
It's-it's no big.
Hey! It's the lovebirds.
Hey, you two.
Oh, hey.
Hey.
He told you, didn't he? She can read my mind.
I mean Oh, come on.
You couldn't wait to tell.
Well, speaking for everyone else, I think it's great.
And now that the happy couple has arrived, let's go eat.
Come on.
I have some very exciting news.
Mr.
conwell is flying in from salt Lake city to see the show tonight.
Mr.
conwell? He is the C.
E.
O.
Of conwell's department stores.
Blair, it's the biggest retailer in the entire country, and my first choice to carry the new junior line.
What about barneys or saks Or bloomingdale's? Hmm.
No, my dear, high-end has fallen on hard times.
Mr.
conwell can put my line in over 5,000 retail locations.
Where bristol palin shops? Feed the masses.
Eat with the classes.
Although you do raise a very good point.
My usual crowd of uptown socialites and boho fashionistas might give Mr.
conwell the wrong message.
We need to surround him with wholesome American girls- the kind of girl that he wants to shop at conwell's.
I just had the most inspired idea.
Dessert at momofuku after the show? No.
You should invite all of your college girlfriends to see the show tonight.
Mother, it's very last minute.
Miss Blair keep girls on busy schedule.
Must beat drum, she says.
Baby beat dorota's stomach like Lars from metallica.
I need a gaggle of * ** college freshmen.
Just bring 10 or 20, no more than 30.
Tell them how important it is to you, to me.
I need Mr.
conwell to say yes.
But, miss Blair, you have no friends.
Even N.
Y.
U.
Minions very second-rate.
Actually There is one person at N.
Y.
U.
Who could help.
Chuck.
Did you send security to kick me out? Just listen.
I- no.
Let me.
Morning, nephew.
What is this leech doing stuck to my hotel? Your hotel? This is Elizabeth's hotel.
You're just a guest who's no longer welcome here.
I'm sorry, Chuck.
You need to leave.
What? Wait.
What the hell is going on here? Isn't it obvious? You've been played, Chucky, from the very beginning.
Now It's check-out time, and we need to get your room ready for, well, me.
Stop.
We hear Chuck's hotel is hanging on by a thread And Jack's pulling all the strings.
Vanessa, I'm seriously so happy for you guys.
Thanks.
It's been really great.
It's been so easy to be with Dan, you know, knowing someone your whole life, like you and Nate.
Yeah, it definitely has its advantages.
When you've known someone so long, you know, you're just more comfortable.
Nate and I have no problem trying new things.
Not like that.
Just keeping the romance and mystery alive.
You don't ever want to fall into a rut.
I'm sure you and Dan yeah, we always try new things.
So since you guys are out of hiding, what are your plans tonight? You should come to Eleanor's fashion show.
Oh, no.
Actually, uh, we're- we're just gonna be doing dinner at the loft.
Vanessa's cooking up some, uh - private dinner, Hmm? Sounds romantic.
No, no.
It's not-it's not like that.
It's not like that.
We're just, you know, watching movies, cooking up some noodles.
Uh, it's kind of become our Saturday tradition.
Agnes, can you put your arms down, please? Both arms.
Look, Agnes, I'm sorry for how everything went down.
I shouldn't have gone behind your back and tried to cut you out of the fashion line.
I was gonna quit anyway.
Those dresses were lame.
Agnes, I'm trying to apologize.
You trusted me, believed in me, and I betrayed you.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for torching your dresses.
Truth is, they were amazing.
Over it? I missed you, bitch.
What is it? Nothing.
Ugh.
Well Truth is I was dating this guy named Damien, and he was a lot of things, one of them being a dealer.
The sid to your Nancy.
That's awesome.
What happened? Well, when I didn't want to, uh Whatever with him, he bailed.
Now he just keeps texting me for his stupid pills.
Sweetie, you can't let him treat you like that.
I know, but whatever.
Spin.
Hey, Damien? It's Jenny's friend Agnes.
What are you doing? Yeah, she wanted me to call you to set up a swap.
We were thinking the Waldorf pop-up show? Love it.
Kiss.
Agnes.
What? Chill out.
This is your payback, okay? He's gonna show up tonight.
You're gonna wave the baggy in front of his face and then flush it down the toilet.
No one gets hurt, and you get to show him who's boss.
Gotta take back your pride, babe.
All right.
I'll admit that's actually kind of brilliant.
We're total bitches.
Hey.
I want to do something special for Dan tonight.
Vanessa, I'm sorry.
I hope I didn't make you feel-- no, not at all.
You were right.
Noodles and movies? I mean, I just don't want it to feel like his one-millionth dinner with the same girl he's known his whole life.
Two words--role-play.
You know, that's- that's not a terrible idea.
Why don't you do a date night inspired by one of his favorite films? He would definitely not be expecting that.

  Hey, so, uh, I'll see you at the loft at 6
0? Okay.
Oh, my God.
What's wrong? We, uh, we have to find Chuck.
You hate it? I had forgotten how talented you are.
I want to close with this.
And after the show is over, you and I need to have a talk about finding you a more permanent position with Waldorf designs.
Yeah.
Wow.
Eleanor, thank you so much.
Yeah.
Treats were in your dresser, just like you said.
Grabbed this clutch to hide 'em.
Ohh! The eagle has landed.
Thank you, kali.
I'm sorry, Agnes I don't--I don't think I wanna go through with this.
It's just that it's the first time in weeks that I've been able to not think about Damien and the first time in even longer that I've actually been happy.
I don't know I just really forgot how much I love this, and I don't want to do anything to mess it up, you know? I'll just text Damien and, uh, tell him to forget it, okay? It's okay.
I get it.
I was just trying to help out an old friend.
Chuck? Are you okay? Hey.
What's going on? It would appear we've all been players in a Jack bass plot.
The reappearance of my mother, the lawsuit-- it's all been part of an elaborate ruse to get me to sign over my hotel to Elizabeth.
You have to admire his handiwork.
Have you spoken to your lawyers? There's gotta be a way.
It turns out my lawyer was in on it.
Regardless, a suit to regain control would take months, in which time Jack would have bankrupted the hotel, making it easy pickings for whatever vultures he has lined up.
My only hope is to talk to Elizabeth alone, convince her to sign the hotel back over to me.
What makes you think she's gonna do that? This isn't her idea.
Jack has something on her.
I just need to figure out what.
I'll call you.
And all this time, we thought Chuck got his dark side from his father.
Maybe his mother's the one that's evil.
If she is his mother.
The story Elizabeth told me- how do we even know it's true? Chuck did a d.
N.
A.
Test.
It was his guy at the N.
Y.
P.
D.
Yeah, I know, but he probably sent it out to a lab.
I mean, I wouldn't put it past Jack bass to fake it.
Well, whatever the truth is, Chuck isn't ready to hear it.
In the meantime, I have to get ready for a fashion show.
It's in 2 hours, and I have 30 friends coming.
What? What friends? Excuse me.
Miss brandeis? Can I help you? I'm dorota.
Uh, miss Blair would like to know, uh, what is your hourly and if you have any friends, like, 30? Hey, Jenny, can you help me get these racks downstairs? Yes.
Oh, don't worry.
I can watch your stuff.
Thanks.
Okay.
Careful, j.
The show's about to start, and it looks like Eleanor's line is going to bring a whole new meaning to high fashion.
Like taking candy from a baby.
Helen, thank you so much for coming.
Storey, you look adorable.
B.
, I know what Chuck said, but shouldn't we-- do nothing.
He says he wants to handle it on his own.
We let him.
You don't think it's killing me? Oh, my God.
Brandeis is here.
Finally.
Serena.
Brandeis.
How's Congressman Wade? He's polling very well these days.
Okay, so there's your target-- the guy over there talking to my mom--ed conwell.
And remember, you guys are my b.
F.
F.
S from N.
Y.
U.
, so-- we got it, Blair.
We're closed for businessmen.
What? My mother said she wanted me to pack the crowd with wholesome American girls.
So you hired escorts? Shh. B., you couldn't just tell your mom you don't have friends at N.Y.U.?
Prostitutes are people, too, and they have a lot of disposable income.
Who are you? Good evening, Daniel.
Hungry?
hey, this is, um, this is just like "Rear window."
I know.
Come on, people.
Trish, the girls look great.
Are they ready? Show's in five minutes.
Agnes, where did you get that? What? It's not like you're gonna do anything with it.
It's just a little party.
What about your 90 days? Look, I need the waldorfs of the world to think that I'm working a program so I can get hired.
Okay, well, I'm not gonna let you risk ruining the entire show.
What are you gonna do? Waltz up to Eleanor and tell her that your drug dealer dumped your virgin ass and now the rest of her models are high on his stash? I will tell Eleanor exactly what happened.
You know, this is my second chance.
And you might not want to change your life, but I certainly want to change mine.
Oh, Eleanor, I need to tell you something.
No.
No, not now, Jenny.
The show-- it's--it's about to start.
Come on.
Get the girls in line.
But, Eleanor, I-- my goodness, getting models to do anything, it's like herding cats.
Yes? Yes, but I really-- Jenny, go.
You know, I think it's time for little j.
To say good night.
I thought you wanted to wait till the after party.
No.
Let's put her to bed early.
I thought I was being taken to the empire.
Elias and a few other employees are still loyal.
I don't know how much my Uncle has promised you, but I'll double it if you give me my hotel back.
Oh, Chuck, this was never about money.
Then what does Jack have on you? 'Cause it must be something for you to do all this.
I love him.
I know it's very difficult for you to understand-- Jack isn't capable of love.
He is using you.
He is stealing my hotel and then he will leave you.
I know he's not perfect, but he understands me.
He doesn't judge me.
Underneath it all, he's a kind, loving person.
What kind of loving person would convince you to do this to me? When we started the game, I told myself That you were just a stranger.
But I didn't know how much I'd come to care for you.
So help me.
Give me back my hotel.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry? That's it? I need Jack.
And I believe he needs me, too.
He--he loves me.
If you believe that Then you deserve whatever happens next.
Wow.
I didn't realize Blair had so many friends at N.Y.U.
Yeah.
Though at $300 an hour, they don't come cheap.
Oh, it's Chuck.
Hey.
I couldn't get through to Elizabeth.
Well, what happened? She thinks she loves Jack.
It's over.
The empire's gone.
I don't know.
Um, what do you say, brandeis? About five minutes? Uh, yeah.
Five minutes.
Maybe not.
Hey, can you get Jack to Eleanor's fashion show? So? Uh, it was great.
It was great.
I'm not really a shellfish kind of guy.
The little middle green parts kinda, you know, but the wine- the wine was amazing.
Montrachet, just like what grace Kelly brought Jimmy Stewart.
That's right, yeah.
But a part of you wishes we'd had ramen.
No.
No.
What? No.
No, no.
Seriously, Vanessa, this was-- this was amazing.
In fact, I got you a little surprise.
The student union is running a mizoguchi marathon tonight.
That sounds amazing, but I thought we'd do something different tonight, break out of our rut.
Our rut? We We just started dating.
What do we do now that we didn't do when we were friends? Are you--are you serious? Obviously, besides that.
All right, is this what that whole "good evening, Daniel" bit over there was all about? I was just trying to put a little mystery in our relationship But if you'd rather just do the same old thing, then hey! Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I was just gonna pick up my 12-string.
No, why don't you stay? I made dessert.
No.
This is clearly a date.
You don't want it to be like every other night the three of us hang out.
Really? Because that sounds exactly like what Dan wants.
What's going on? I-I'm not sure.
Don't you just love the line? Everybody looks good in it, even the people who shop in your store.
The clothes speak for themselves, but, unfortunately, our stores will never carry your mother's line if this is the type of clientele that will be attracted to conwell's.
What? It attracts all kinds.
Everyone is here.
Yeah, I can see that.
Apparently Even prostitutes.
Hey, Jenny.
Eleanor wanted to congratulate you on a great show and say thanks for all your hard work.
Aw, thank you.
Last year she congratulated me herself with a toast.
Well, you deserve it.
We hear Eleanor's show brought down the house.
Did you give her one or two? Three.
Sounds like a night to remember if you can.
Aw, what's the matter, j.
? Champagne go to your head? Did you put something in my drink? You know, ever since I saw you at Eleanor's, all I could think about was payback for last year.
Then Damien's party favors just happened to fall into my lap.
What, did you think I was gonna stand around all day and watch Eleanor kiss your ass? You know, I was gonna have my own fashion line.
Things were gonna change for me.
And then you had to go ahead and do it all your way.
So here's to you, j.
Cheers.
Nate, I heard my nephew's ready to cry Uncle.
Where is he? You can wait by the bar.
Now we just need Jack to be Jack.
Vanessa, this is fantastic.
I didn't realize you made flan.
I got the recipe off the Internet.
Oh.
Did you do something to your hair? Excuse me.
Son, I have to tell you, this date is a disaster.
What's going on? She has this idea that we're stuck in a rut, and she's trying to break us out of it.
A rut? You just started dating.
Yeah.
I-I-I know.
Look, the two of you just need to talk this through.
She's Vanessa.
You're Dan.
You guys are best friends.
Did she just leave? You whore and a half.
You couldn't just keep it in your pants? Conwell was about to buy my mother's junior line until you-- Blair, I didn't cruise Mr.
conwell.
Then how does he know You're a prostitute? He doesn't.
He knows Julian is.
He's supposed to see him tonight, in fact.
Julian and conwell party every time he flies into town.
I'm really sorry, Blair.
We had no idea there'd be clients here tonight.
It was a total surprise.
I bet it was.
Brandeis, my apologies.
I'll be right back.
Mr.
conwell, a moment! Your special friend, Julian, wanted you to know that he's running a little late tonight.
Blair, I-I have a family.
So do I, Mr.
conwell.
And when you love your family, like we both do, you never want to see them get hurt or disappointed.
What's that? You want to take another look at my mother's line? Of course you can.
So we photograph Jack with a couple of hookers and then show it to Elizabeth? Yes, and then she signs the empire back to Chuck.
Okay.
You've only got one shot.
Evening.
Serena.
Nate.
This is Jessica and bethany.
Were you hoping to catch me in a compromising position? A little High School, don't you think? Leave the plotting to the experts.
Bethany, what were you saying about sustainable energy? I'm gonna call Chuck.
I'll find Blair.
Wait! Wait.
This little one's not going home just yet, we're gonna go see if we can get this girl laid.
Pile in, bitches.
Spotted--little j.
Passing out in a taxi.
Jenny? Hey! Jenny! Uh-oh.
Looks like somebody better call the fashion police.
Is this where the bachelor party is? Yeah.
You here to join us? Me? No.
But, uh, my friend here- she's ready to party.
Make sure you guys show her a good time.
Thank you, Amy.
This is my first review for " teen vogue.
" I'm very excited.
Mother! Bye, Eleanor.
What? Great news.
Eleanor.
Mr.
conwell.
I just wanted to tell you that conwell's would be honored to call itself your exclusive retailer.
That is marvelous news, isn't it, Blair? Congratulations.
Yes.
Of course we need to make a few alterations-- uh, hemlines, necklines.
You understand.
We could certainly discuss it.
Is that all? And we'd like to change the name.
"Eleanor waldorf" sounds a bit uppity and new york-ish.
Excuse me.
For the last 28 years, every piece of clothing I have sewn has carried the name "Eleanor Waldorf.
" My clothes are me.
My store is me.
Manhattan is an island in more ways than one.
What works for you and yours doesn't necessarily translate to me and mine.
Mr.
conwell, I think you're forgetting about something or someone.
Blair.
I want to thank you for your time, but I do not think I will be doing business with conwell's.
Enjoy your flight back to salt Lake.
Mother, what are you doing? We could close this.
No.
It was a stupid idea to begin with.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I would rather lose the deal than lose myself.
Never hide who you are- you remember that, Hmm? Everyone at N.
Y.
U.
Hates me.
What? I have minions, of course, but They're hardly even worthy of the name.
No, I-I-I don't understand.
What about all your friends from school? They'll be anyone's friend For the night.
I was scared to tell you about N.
Y.
U.
Because I didn't want you to be disappointed in me.
I did everything to try and fit in, but I hate it there.
Ohh.
My girl.
One of the things that make Waldorf women so special is that we don't fit in everywhere.
But I don't feel like I fit in anywhere.
That's 'cause you haven't found the right place yet.
You will.
All right, one more round and we're out of here.
Maybe I should stay and, uh, take care of blondie.
No.
No.
We'll tell the bartender to call her a cab.
All right, first, shots! Hello? Hey.
Where are you? I've been calling you for-- Nate? Um, I don't know where I am.
I feel sick.
Okay, Jenny, hold on one second.
Listen, just stay put.
All right, I'm coming to get you.
Hurry, please.
Can we talk? So, uh, look, what happened tonight? Don't you worry that we do all the same stuff we did when we were best friends? We go to movies, we play scrabble with Rufus, we go to coffee shops and make fun of people.
We are the exact same.
Yeah, well, except-- yes, I know.
We have s*x.
But I just wanted to do something to say, hello, we're more than friends with benefits.
No, I was going to say except, uh, it's not the same.
And if you give me a chance, I want to take you on the most romantic second first date you've ever had.
Where? Well, that's, uh, that's a surprise.
I hope you didn't bring me here to gloat over your boyfriend's loyalty.
Chuck, I called you because This afternoon, I didn't have the courage to tell you that I I signed the hotel over to Jack.
Seeing you made me realize what I'd done, and--and so then I told him he had to make a choice-- me or the hotel.
And what did my Uncle say? My flight to Zurich leaves at 10:00.
I wanted to say good-bye.
I'm sorry.
I tried.
Stay Not for Jack or the hotel.
Stay for me.
I already lost my mother once.
Chuck I'm Not your mother.
I don't know if your real mother is alive or not, but I'm sure she loved you very much and that she's nothing like me.
You're right.
Because my real mother could never have done to me what you did.
Andy better be calling that chick a cab, man.
That girl looked about 12.
Hey.
Where is she? Want to get out of here? I live real close.
Come on.
Where's Nate? Is Nate your boyfriend? No.
'Cause he really shouldn't have left you.
Ooh.
No, I don't Jenny.
Who the hell are you? Get off her.
I was helping her.
Yeah, sure you were.
It seems chivalry isn't dead after all.
Lucky for this damsel in a dress, some things never go out of fashion.
How you feeling? Steadier.
How do I look? I don't want to worry my dad.
Yeah, just, um, play the exhausted card, okay? Hey.
How was the show? I thought you'd be back a little sooner.
Yeah.
Sorry I'm late.
The show was great, though.
Yeah, there were no cabs, so I just figured I'd walk her back.
Yeah.
I'm so tired.
Um, I'm just gonna crash.
But thank you so much, dad.
I love you.
Thanks for seeing her home.
Oh, yeah.
Good night.
So I finally told my mom about N.
Y.
U.
.
B.
, I'm very proud of you for telling your mother the truth.
Why? What good does the truth ever do? My mother can't help me make friends.
Excuse me.
Aren't you Blair Waldorf? Yes.
Sorry to bother you.
But we're freshmen at Columbia and, well We thought you were dead.
We haven't read about you on "Gossip Girl" in forever.
What? You read "Gossip Girl"? Of course.
Everyone at Columbia does.
Wow.
I-I love your louboutins.
But The bow goes on the right.
Oh.
Thank you.
Bye.
S.
, what do you know about Columbia? Hey, you forgot your purse.
You okay? What's wrong with me? Nothing is wrong with you.
What are you talking about? Like, how did I end up here? Jenny, look at me.
Okay, things Haven't exactly been so easy for me either.
Now I'm with Serena, and I'm so happy.
Things will turn around for you, too.
Yeah.
What if you're wrong, Nate? What if everything we just-- it's Eleanor.
"Great job today.
You're hired.
Lunch tomorrow.
" Okay.
Oh, my God.
See? And I-I hope you learn from this, okay, mostly that I'm always right.
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh, God, Nate, thank you so much for tonight.
Yeah.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Here.
Try the bryndza.
Come on, swap.
The, uh, the cabbage is my second favorite.
So this was your big romantic date, having pierogies delivered to my dorm room? Tell me you're not having fun.
No, I am, but this isn't a date.
This is what we always do.
I know, yeah, except now we get to do this.
And that's called being friends with benefits.
No.
No, because for me, the benefit is that even though we're-- we're doing the same things that we used to do--eating pierogies and going to see "ugetsu" for the sixth time-- we've only seen it four times.
Well, right now-- now I get to do them with you as my girlfriend, which is why just sitting here with you is the most romantic date I can imagine.
Humphrey, you just earned yourself some extra benefits.
If you are what you wear, you better dress the part you want.
A few lucky ladies can do no wrong.
Their look's perfection, and they've got accessories to match.
but most girls get tired of the same old look, and they'll do just about anything to get the hot new piece on their arm.
and then there are those with no vision of their own-- thieves of fashion who'll steal the shirt off your back.
did you change your mind? Mm, I was hoping you changed yours.
Perhaps you need to see the view from up here.
People really do look like ants.
How did I ever love you? Fair question.
But if love won't tempt you, how about money? I'm leaving, and I don't want anything.
Where are you gonna go? You destroyed your relationship with your son.
Who else do you have besides me? I told Chuck I wasn't his mother and that he deserves someone better than me.
I'll warn you-- you're taking off just when it's about to get fun.
I'm starting over.
I'm going to try to be the person I forgot.
And always remember, appearances can be deceiving.
let's go.
Chuck.
Are you okay? What happened? Elizabeth? Is dead to me.
She's gone.
And the hotel? Oh, lost.
Oh, Chuck What? Sorry? Don't be.
I'm not.
I've come this far without my mother.
I'm not backing down now.
Well If it's a war Jack wants, then it's a war he'll get.
But whatever you wear, always dress to kill.
X.
O.

O.
, Gossip Girl.
"Gossip Girl" here your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
Hey! It's the lovebirds.
Hey, you two.
He told you, didn't he? - Speaking for everyone, I think it's great.
Ever since I saw you, all I could think about - was payback for last year.
Did you put something in my drink? She's ready to party.
Make sure you guys show her a good time.
Jenny! - Nate, thank you so much for tonight.
I'm sorry, Chuck.
You need to leave.
What the hell is going on here? Isn't it obvious? You've been played, Chuck, - from the very beginning.
I didn't have the courage to tell you - that I signed the hotel over to Jack.
And the hotel? Oh, lost.
I've come this far without my mother.
I'm not backing down now.
If it's a war Jack wants, then it's a war he'll get.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, "Gossip Girl.
" Every war has its weapons.
But on the upper east side, the rules of battle are simple - there are no rules.
Well, now I really, really hope those are for my birthday.
Uh, actually Chuck and Blair left them after one of their games.
Happy birthday, though.
So when do I get to unwrap my present? What is that? It's, um, just a garter holster.
It's for my cell phone.
Well, then I'd better take you upstairs so I can inspect it.
Oh, except I have to go shopping with Blair to pick out a dress for tonight.
You still haven't told me where you're taking me, but just so you know, you don't have to dress up - for a Knicks game.
But you do for the Frick benefit.
It's for Asian horned toads.
They're in danger.
That's your surprise a toad benefit? Well, I know it's not what you would choose to do on your birthday, but Chuck bought a table, and we can celebrate this weekend.
And you're going to lunch with your grandfather.
That's festive.
Yeah, I'm gonna hit the hit the shower.
So you have fun shopping.
See you at 3:00? - Yep.
Hello, Mr.
Nate.
Hey.
I feel very bad not wishing him happy birthday or bringing him Polish breakfast sausage in bed.
Oh, Dorota, Nate has to think everyone's blowing off his birthday so he'll really be surprised tonight.
And he likes this game where you kill people? It's called "Assassin," and he loves it.
Did you get his phone? In case anyone posts about the party.
I don't want him checking "Gossip Girl.
" Can you hide this? Thank you, Dorota.
You really have surrounded yourself with beautiful things, so easy to auction off.
Gotta love Ebay.
As much as I hate to interrupt your fun, this has gone on long enough.
I want my hotel back.
Name your price.
I don't need your money, Chuck.
Then what is all this for just to hurt me? Just to hurt you? Hurting you is a noble goal.
Granted, you know, it wasn't all that difficult.
You're not the man you used to be.
If you're referring to the fact I'm not in Thailand smoking hash with prostitutes, change is good.
Young Chuck in love.
Beautiful and sad.
Bart always said you were soft.
My father left me the company instead of you.
I get it.
I'm more than happy letting Lily guide my stock - towards a tidy profit.
I know the Empire is not your endgame.
And if it's wounding me, you've done it.
So why are you still here? It's an interesting feeling holding another man's prized possession.
You wonder how far he'll go to get it back, if there's anything he wouldn't do.
I will do anything.
Well, there is something that caught my eye.
I think I have to unfriend Ryuichi.
I thought the boy you met in Japan was named Hideo.
I met them both.
Uh, Hideo was - More than a friend.
Thank you.
Point is, Hideo and his friends have a fondness for bathhouses and group photos.
Oh, my god.
Unfriend him immediately.
Sayonara, Ryuichi-san.
Yeah, I didn't need to see that.
Hideo was supposed to be my rebound from Jonathan.
Now I need a rebound from Hideo.
It's a vicious cycle.
I'm sure there are tons of boys who'd love to go out with you.
Rufus, Jonathan and I are the only ones at St.
Jude's who are even out.
I should just bury myself - in work like Jenny.
Hey, you know, I like working for Eleanor.
I don't need a guy to make me feel fulfilled - especially when he's unavailable.
Uh, poor Nate.
What? - Just reading the e-mail from Serena reminding everyone - to blow off his birthday.
That seems kind of mean.
It's an act.
She's planning this whole surprise thing at the Waldorfs'.
She's spending the whole afternoon - getting it ready.
Wait.
I don't get it then.
What is Nate supposed - to do all day, just sit at home and think everyone - forgot his birthday? - He spends five hours thinking Serena is a terrible girlfriend.
He'll forgive her.
Five hours.
I, uh have to go to the fabric store.
All right.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, god.
Denjuro, you are definitely not my friend.
Hey.
Good morning.
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Hey.
Have you been up all night? 'Cause it looks like you've killed an entire forest, and your breath smells like something dead.
Oh, thanks.
Um, the application for the Tisch writing program is due in, uh, in in two days, so I just I need to bear down and finish my 1-act.
Is this the same 1-act that you were 95% done with last week, - but didn't want to show me until it was 100% done? - Uh, yeah, yeah, but you know, there's no point in showing it to you until I've taken it as far as I can myself.
This is why we used to show each other our work - as soon as possible, remember? - Uh, yeah, I do, but that was before we started sleeping together.
Yeah, I know.
But we said we'd date and still be friends, and this is being friends.
In fact What's that? This is my script for my short film class that I've been nervous about showing you.
This is the one based on my short story.
Now hand yours over.
Uh Okay.
All right.
You gotta be completely honest here.
Uh, and I gotta you should ignore this first part.
In fact, why don't why don't we just exchange tomorrow? You know, I gotta help Serena out with Nate's birthday party, and this it'll give me time to give yours proper consideration, maybe fine-tune this one just a little bit more, - which it needs.
Nice try, but you can read mine on the subway after you shower.
Have a good day.
Jenny, hey.
Hey.
Um, I tried texting you.
Oh, yeah, I can't seem to find my cell phone.
Oh.
What are you doing here? It's your birthday.
Happy birthday.
All right, thank you.
Here, I got you this.
Oh, wow.
You know, I'd say, like, let me take you out to lunch or something, but, um, I'm sure you and Serena - already have plans.
No, actually.
Actually, we don't.
I was gonna gonna go to lunch with my grandfather.
Oh.
All right, well, have fun.
Nate? I really just wanted to say thank you again for last week.
I don't know what would have happened.
You know what? Let me just call my grandfather and cancel.
I'm sure he'll understand.
# one, two # # r-les, loso, we do it like, hey # The look on his face was so sad.
I wanted to call him back and say, I didn't forget your birthday.
I've got this whole party planned.
Cruel to be kind, S.
Nate'll be fine.
No word from Chuck? - He was sitting down with satan this morning.
He's gonna lay everything out on the table, see if there's anything in the world he could offer Jack to give up the hotel.
He's come so far, become the person I always knew he could be.
But he could lose it all because he opened his heart to that raven-haired con artist.
Everything will be fine, Blair.
No matter what, Chuck has you, - and he loves you.
The Empire is just a hotel.
You don't understand.
The hotel is proof that Bart was wrong about Chuck.
It's become who he is.
Well, then you have to show him that he has so much more, Starting with buying this dress.
Come on, B.
Once Chuck sees you in it, he'll realize Empire or no Empire, Blair Waldorf loves him, and no one else can say that.
Thanks, S.
I have to go get everything ready for Nate's party.
Are you gonna be okay? Let me know if Chuck calls you.
And buy that dress.
She's right.
It is a remarkable dress, made only more so by you in it.
What are you doing here, besides stalking me? Please, I was just window-shopping and saw something I liked.
You're supposed to be meeting with Chuck.
Oh, we met.
Ideas were discussed, voices raised, expletives used.
And how's your morning been, gorgeous? You think you've won.
But Chuck will find a way to get back what you stole.
There's always a way.
I told him how to get back his hotel.
And here's the kicker it wouldn't cost him a dime.
What are you talking about? I'm saying Chuck can have the Empire, and all it would cost is you spending the night with me.
How's that grab you? Careful, B.
Jack Bass' weapon of choice comes fully loaded, and if he hits his target, there'll be at least two victims.
I'd rather spend the night with the Marquis De Sade, - and yes, I know he's dead.
I'm surprised this is your response knowing how attached Chuck is to his hotel, what it means to him.
I thought you really cared for him.
Excuse me, I thought you were just a disgusting pig.
But now I realize you're actually demented.
Taking what belongs to Chuck has become a real passion of mine, and I would find this particular conquest deeply satisfying.
While I'm flattered, I assure you that Chuck and I - will find another way.
Chuck opened his heart to you, and now his future lies in your hands Well, not your hands, exactly.
But you could fix this.
He would never have to know.
Chuck will win, and I'll be right by his side, as long as it takes for that to happen.
As long as you're at his side and not mine, that will never happen.
You should at least try it on.
Hey.
Hey, I was just about to call you.
You know that polaroid film I told you I had? I don't.
Ohh.
I promised Serena that I would get it for Nate's party.
We need it for the game of "Assassin.
" - Well This is the one thing she gave me to do, if I messed up, she'll kill me, - and not in a fun game way.
Done.
Now what's wrong? Is it because Serena never threw you a surprise party? Because you hate surprises.
No, no.
Uh, Vanessa just she wrote this script.
She wants me to read it.
And? - Well, it's not great.
Give her notes.
I thought that's what you guys always do - with each other's work.
Well, yeah, as friends.
I think in relationships, there's such a thing as too much honesty.
For instance, it would not have been a good idea for me to tell Serena how I felt about every outfit she wore.
Well, telling a woman you like her clothes is not lying.
It's self-preservation.
Yeah, but the truth has shades of gray, right? - I mean, there's such a thing as spin.
A half-truth is a whole lie, son.
In my experience, it causes the same amount of problems down the line, especially with the ladies.
So Serena must have something really great planned for you guys tonight, right? Yeah, some toad gala at the Frick.
Uh, that sounds Boring? Yeah, I know.
I mean, it's not like I had some high expectations.
I just expected Serena to be a little more I mean, you know.
Basically, this burger is definitely - the best part of my day so far.
It's the best part of mine, too.
Actually, you know, the best part of the week.
How are you after that whole thing at Eleanor's? You know you can always come to me, right? Yeah, thanks.
But today is not about me.
Did I mention that public embarrassment is a part of the Humphrey birthday tradition? Okay, I'm actually happy to be humiliated.
Good.
Blow out your candle.
Make a wish.
Yay! Okay, bye.
I brought my trench coat, camera.
Prepare to be assassinated.
Will do.
Thanks.
Something wrong? Oh, you read my script and you didn't like it.
I can take it, I think.
Um no, you're right.
I didn't, uh, I didn't like it.
I loved it.
Really? Loved it? - No notes? - No.
I mean, only note I've got is I wish I wish there was more of it.
Yeah, so what did you think of my play? Oh, um, I didn't get a chance to read it yet.
Oh, all right.
No worries.
But I do have to get - the application in day after tomorrow, so - Okay.
Oh, Miss Serena, I about to text.
Dorota, what is going on? Everything should be done by now.
Everyone's gonna be here soon.
Vans get messed up.
Dead body cake go to wedding.
Wedding cake come here.
It's very pretty, - but pink not Mr.
Nate's color.
Oh, my god.
We have to stall Nate.
William has to keep him occupied.
No cookies like hearts! Find bullets and knives and little bombs that go boom! Mr.
Van Der Bilt, it's Serena, but don't tell Nate.
Oh.
Okay, um Yyeah, I'll let him know when I see him.
Nate's not with him.
He said he called last-minute and cancelled.
Then where be he? Let's find out.
Well, listen, I gotta get going.
I told Serena I'd be there by 3:00 to get ready for the gala.
Uh, white shirt, black tie.
I'd think you'd have it down by now.
Have fun tonight.
Yeah.
Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine.
I don't know.
It's just whenever I'm alone, I can't not think of the other night, you know? Hey, I'm sorry.
You shouldn't keep Serena waiting.
It's just you're the only one who gets what I'm going through right now.
Well, hey, I'm sure Serena won't mind if I'm a little bit late, right?
Like you said, white shirt, black tie.
How long can it take to get ready for a gala?
"Attention, upper east siders. Nate Archibald is MIA. Send tips and pics ASAP. Help Serena find her man."
Um You know, I kind of just want to disappear - in the dark for a while.
Do you want to go see a movie? - I'm in.
Okay.
Thank you, Gregor.
Chuck.
Back from shopping and no packages? Who are you, and what have you done with my girlfriend? Nothing suited my sensibilities.
How was your talk with Jack? I was wrong to think I could negotiate with terrorists.
Did he offer you anything? - Nothing I would ever consider.
Maybe when he sees he can't get what he wants, - he'll stop toying with you.
One can only hope.
Hello? Thank you.
You were right.
After I said no to Jack's offer, he's called off the game play.
He's closing the hotel.
It's over.
Miss Blair, this package arrive for you.
There is card.
One last chance to save your man.
Jack Careful, B.
Don't forget your first rule of battle Beware of Bass's bearing gifts.
Has Nate showed up yet? - He'll be here soon.
I'm I'm really sorry.
I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
Hey, um, any word on Nate from Vanya's doorman contacts? - Dorota has pretty much the entire eastern block on lookout.
Anything on "Gossip Girl"? # find out what's news # - Uh, I'm gonna keep looking.
Serena, come here.
You've done some unforgivable things like having s*x with Nate when we were saving ourselves for each other - or killing Pete Fairman - What? How far is too far? Where is that place you can't come back from anymore? Blair, what are you talking about? - Is Chuck gonna do something to Jack? - What? I mean yes.
There is something someone could do to get back the Empire, and yes, it is terrible, but they'd be doing it out of love.
Love of whom? - Just love.
The point is, if someone does something awful, - but it's for love, is it okay? - If you are crossing some moral line to best Jack Bass, then probably not.
What are you not telling me? - Nothing.
You're right.
Thank you.
I should go get dressed.
Oh, and I invited my minions.
It'll be like shooting fish in a barrel.
Hey, Jenny.
It's me.
Uh, I just wanted to remind you that Nate needed to be here no later than an hour ago.
Bring him to the party right now.
Hey, where's Nate? I'm determined to believe he'll arrive momentarily.
He's better, with all of his Columbia friends here.
Do you want me to start taking pictures of people? - Yes, please.
I'll grab Vanessa's camera.
# I've been tricked, poisoned and misled # # in what I've been told # # oh, baby, you don't listen much # # to what I know # # I know, I know, I know, I know, I # # and our hearts are # Hey.
Do you need something? Camera.
Here.
Smile like the killer you are.
Chuck? Are you gonna come down and join the party? I just heard from my lawyers.
I was waiting to see if there was any chance - of keeping the Empire doors open.
And? There's not.
Jack's within his rights to shutter the place.
I just have to watch it die, a slow painful death.
When you bought the Empire, you told me you knew you could do it because I believe in you.
That hasn't changed.
You'll find a way.
When are you going to get it? There is no way! I'm sorry.
I'm not mad at you.
It's my own fault.
I am everything my father said I was.
Oh.
Even without the guest of honor, it's still a great party.
I can't believe he didn't even call.
Well, you did steal his phone.
You have a point, but we did have plans, even if it was a made-up ball for a non-endangered reptile.
Okay, you're freaking me out with the nunchakus.
He probably thinks that I didn't care about his birthday.
Surprise! Surprise! Sorry we're late, everyone! Crazy, you.
Uh-oh, S.
Looks like little J's knives are sharpened, ad she's ready to use them in the battle for Nate Archibald.
The game of "assassin" is simple kill or be killed.
Your photo is your life.
You wear it around your neck.
If someone grabs your picture before you grab theirs, ten you're dead, and you have to give them all the pictures of everyone else you've killed.
Once you're a ghost, you come back here to the safe zone for the party.
You can't go beyond this block, but restaurants, buildings, shops all fair game.
The winner is the last assassin on the street, and they have all the other photos.
So you have five safe minutes to leave the building.
Starting now.
-Spread out.
I can't believe you were in on this.
Nicely played.
Thank you.
I figured someone had to keep him distracted.
I gotta go before I end up dead.
I can't believe you did this.
It's awesome.
I mean, you totally had me going.
Apparently.
What, were you just not gonna show up to the gala? - What? No.
Something with Jenny just came up.
Yeah, I got that.
Okay, we have exactly four minutes left to live.
Do you really want to spend it talking like this? Hey, come on.
Game's starting.
Let's go.
I'm already dead.
You still have your photo.
Formality.
Although you're welcome to kill me again if you like.
# every day I wanted peace and fun # # every night I want to melt # # and slowly let's fly away # # everything is gonna be okay # # it's gone today # Oh, well.
Hello, Dorota.
What are you doing here? I will be killed if someone find me.
Why would somebody kill you? Antiroyalists from Russia? No.
In game.
Then I must do something before you die.
Dorota Dorota from the first moment I saw you, I knew you were princess.
And every day you make me feel like king.
Will you Yes, yes! Yes, of course I will marry you! At least now I die with happiness.
Oh! Oh, Vanya, I'm so sorry.
Hey.
You okay? Uh, yeah, I am.
Are you Okay? - I am engaged.
Oh! Oh, wow, wow! Congratulations, both of you.
Uh, sorry.
A friend's housekeeper and our doorman just got engaged.
But you obviously got that, the the engagement.
Yeah, that's pretty self-explanatory.
It's the all-black outfit that's throwing me.
I'm in the middle of a game of assassin.
Oh.
Well, okay, please continue on your way.
I'd hate to contribute to your untimely death.
It looks like I'm safe for a moment.
Do you live in the building? No, no.
I just like hanging out in random lobbies, overhearing marriage proposals and looking for pickup games - of assassin.
Then this is definitely your lucky day.
Indeed.
There is actually something that I have to take care of for a minute, but dead or alive, I will be right back.
Yeah, thanks.
Thank you.
Hey, get out of my truck! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more important prey to hunt.
Ooh.
You might want to call Rufus and say your good-byes.
Okay.
I'm kind of into this killer side of you.
Well, I'd hate for you to die without getting a chance to read my script.
I promise I will.
I know you have a deadline.
You know, I'll give you another copy 'Cause the one in your bag is pretty marked up.
I'm sorry, Dan.
I didn't know what to do.
And I was gonna tell you, but then you liked mine so much, - that I didn't know what to say.
Are you saying you felt sorry for me? - That's not what I meant.
Well, good.
As long as we're being honest, your script was not an "A"-plus.
It was a "D.
" At least you'll be together on the other side.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't care about the game.
We need to talk.
Okay.
About what? - What were you doing with Nate today? - Keeping him busy.
We both know that wasn't the plan.
Nate and I are just friends.
Friends don't kiss friends at their fashion shows.
You have history with him.
Yes, ancient.
I promise I'm not gonna do anything - to give Nate the wrong impression.
Now is that all? - No.
You can't kill me.
You're already dead.
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
Ohh.
Any last words before I open this door and murder you? Look, I know you thought that I blew off your birthday, - but you did ditch me.
Well Serena, it wasn't like that.
Nate I need to know why you ignored our plans to spend the day with Jenny.
Well, I promised her I wouldn't say anything.
Okay, last week something really messed up happened to her.
And she came to you about it? - Only because I was involved.
Well, that's not making me feel any better.
Okay, some girls from Eleanor's fashion show they roofie'd her, and then they dumped her off at some bar - with all these guys.
Oh, my god.
I Is she okay? Yeah.
I mean, I got there before anything actually happened, But, you know, she's she's having a tough time.
So I'm sorry.
You're such a good guy, Nate Archibald.
Can I kiss you before I kill you? Gotcha.
Watch your back.
Well, looks like it's just you and Nate left.
I'm on it.
# they say hip-hop is dead # # treat it # # brains # # hey, brains # # if hip-hop's deceased # # I'm the rhyme of the living dead # # walking really slow with metaphors oozing outta my head # Hey, Chuck, have you seen Blair? - I assume she's still slaying.
She can't be.
Her polaroid's right here.
You know Blair.
She's probably cheating.
If you'll excuse me a moment Blair? One last chance to save your man.
Jack When all other weapons fail, there's always human sacrifice.
I knew the memory of our new year's together - would bring you back.
I'm not here for you.
I'm here to get Chuck's hotel.
Eh, semantics, really.
I've had a contract drawn up.
Now suddenly you don't trust me? What are your demands? "No kissing" seems to be, you know, some working girls' rule of thumb.
You'll tell Chuck that you realized he isn't worth losing Bass Australia over.
Now that you've devalued the Empire, you're willing to sell it back, at a profit, of course, so he doesn't suspect anything.
You know I love a win-win proposition.
And Chuck can never know.
Uh, I think I've already proven I'm not one to kiss and tell.
Fine.
I've I've already had his hotel.
Now I'll leave knowing I've had the thing he holds even dearer.
Everything that was his is mine.
That dress looks almost as beautiful on as I'm sure it will off.
But first, a drink.
Oh, I'm sorry.
She's trying to kill me.
Yeah, only because he's trying to kill me.
The grilled cheese with truffles is really good, by the way.
Looks like it's "till death do us part.
" Someday maybe you girls find true love, too and your children not grow up to be bastards.
Congratulations, Dorota, Vanya.
Hey, uh, Dorota, do you remember the guy that I was talking to in the lobby? I don't even remember own name.
All a blur of sparkly Yeah.
So, uh, it it wasn't a "D", it wasn't.
But it wasn't an "A"-plus, either.
I did think the male character's dialogue sounded a little bit like a girl, you know, so I can see that.
Thanks for being honest.
That's actually a really helpful note.
Uh, all right.
Well, you gotta do me now.
Tear me to pieces.
Be brutal.
You know I think you're an amazing writer.
Really? That brutal? It's just a play about a homeless man winning the lottery? - It seems a little out of your wheelhouse.
Oof.
Well, all right.
Well, I was you know, I was trying to show some range.
I know.
But when you write about what you know, you're amazing.
Like that story about graduating from St.
Jude's having never fit in that was really beautiful.
See, what would have happened if you didn't tell me this, and I sent the wrong one with my Tisch application? - They would've loved you anyway.
Sure you're not lying again? Never.
Is it wrong that trying to kill you is the best time I've had in months? Actually, that's a great reason to let me live.
You are the birthday boy.
I should let you kill me.
Uh oh.
You're dead.
Champagne okay? I prefer something stronger to kill the germs.
Hmm.
It must be lonely for you with chuck under all this pressure.
Has the stress compromised his ability to perform romantically? I'm here because I love Chuck.
Don't flatter yourself into thinking I'm going to enjoy this.
Whatever you need to tell yourself.
I think we've had enough foreplay.
Huh.
Thank you.
What? That's it? You already signed the contract.
You can't go back now.
Don't worry.
Chuck will get his hotel.
But contrary to what you may believe, - I prefer the woman to want to have s*x with me.
I don't understand.
If you don't want me, then why did you set this up? I told Chuck I'd take either you or the hotel.
He chose to give me you.
No.
What are you talking about? - Chuck doesn't know anything about this.
Really? Because it seems to me he knew exactly which buttons to have me push.
Said you wouldn't be able to resist stepping in to save him behind his back.
You were there while I was shopping.
You were the only one who saw this dress.
And who do you think sent me to that store? I'd never drop that kind of money on a dress.
My goal was to destroy Chuck.
But now that he has you, I had to break that bond.
Chuck would never do this to me.
If you don't believe me, check his credit card receipts.
I'm sorry, Blair.
Just be grateful one of the Bass men has some moral integrity.
Although, if you're interested in some revenge s*x I'd be more than happy to oblige.
Arms are laid down, only to realize you've been hit by friendly fire.
Okay, so what the hell was that? What do you mean? We were playing, and I killed you.
Jenny, us hanging out was just as friends.
Yeah, I know.
Nate, seriously, I thought that you'd be happy I was finally having fun again.
Guys, I won.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Hey, I'm so glad it's over.
Hi.
How could you lose? - Oh, stop it.
CDs.
Home so soon? Please tell me Jack was lying, - That you wouldn't betray me like that.
Me, betray you? You're the one who just came from seeing my uncle.
I went there for you because I thought it was the only way that would save your hotel.
I would've done anything to help you.
All you had to do was ask.
If I asked, it wouldn't have worked.
You would have been too willing.
When Jack came to you, he would've known we were working together.
I did what I had to, to win.
No.
I can't let my feelings cost me all that I've built.
Even if it means losing me instead? All I ever did was love you.
"The worst thing I ever did, the darkest thought I ever had.
" You said you would stand by me through anything.
This, Blair, is "anything.
" I never thought that the worst thing you would ever do would be to me.
You went up there on your own.
Good-bye, Chuck.
# who's to know? # Hey.
I'm sorry for tricking you.
Oh, it was worth it.
Seriously? Best birthday ever.
Well, it's not over yet.
I still have to give you your present.
Hey, Jenny, you ready? I'm gonna grab our coats.
Yeah, I'm done.
I mean, yeah, I'm ready to go.
# so make believe in miracles instead # When the battle ends and weapons are put away, new strategies take shape.
# who's to show # # no fear? # Hey, Vanessa.
Hi.
Professor Romano sent this over earlier.
You weren't here, so the messenger left it with me.
I didn't know you were applying to the Tisch writing program.
I'm kind of not telling anyone.
It's really competitive.
I mean, there are only a few spots for NYU transfers.
I hope you get in.
Thanks.
# make believe in miracles # # my friends # Soldiers decide to defend for themselves.
Hey, there you are.
I think you lost this.
Thanks.
How'd you know what apartment I was in? Well, I, uh I started on the first floor and worked my way up.
You do realize that this is the penthouse, right? I'm Eric.
I'm Elliot.
New alliances are made # who's to give # But there are casualties.
# everything # # 'cause that's the way you play the game of life # # you create the world you want to see outside # Welcome home, Chuck.
You're not mad at me, are you? I mean, you didn't actually believe Blair could sleep with me and you two would be okay? Or are you mad because I told her? Security, I need Jack Bass escorted from my penthouse immediately.
You may have told her - but Blair and I will get past this.
Is that what you think? Don't you get it, Chuck? Blair's seen the real you now.
It's over.
She could never love that.
No one could.
Hope the Empire's everything you wanted 'Cause now that's all you got.
In matters of love and war, all weapons cause injury.
The question is, who will live to fight another day? X.
O.

Jenny, us hanging out was just as friends.
That was my mother, and she is at canyon ranch.
You should go.
I'm elliot.
How'd you know what apartment I was in? I started on the first floor and worked my way up.
Dorota, will you - yes, of course I will marry you! I told chuck I'd take either you or the hotel.
He chose to give me you.
I did what I had to to win.
Even if it means losing me instead? You went up there on your own.
good-bye, chuck.
What are you doing here? Boss' orders.
Oh! aah! No! Chuck! No! No.
No.
No.
No.
No! Up and at 'em, upper east siders.
It's time to awake from our slumber And learn the hard truth That some nightmares don't end once we open our eyes.
You're not gonna find anything in there.
Luckily for me, I own a bar downstairs.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Drink this.
Look, we know this has to do With whatever's going on between you and blair.
Okay, you got the empire back.
You two should be celebrating, not fighting.
You wanna tell us what's going on? Here.
I thought our relationship Could withstand anything.
Apparently, I was wrong.
Well, you still love her, don't you? Then show her that you're sorry.
Take her to blue hill upstate Or buy her those louboutins at saks.
I'd have to buy saks itself, And that still wouldn't be enough.
She doesn't want to talk to me.
I've tried.
When? Look, you haven't been outside in days.
She asked me to leave her alone.
You don't want to wait too long, chuck, Or she'll think you don't care.
excuse me.
You think it worked? well, maybe you'll have better luck with blair.
Wait.
What? You're making me do this alone? Breakfast with the humphreys, remember? Let me know how it goes.
Good luck.
H- hello? Hello? dorota? What on earth is going on? I am sorry, miss eleanor, mr.
Cyrus.
That was my mother.
She come with father to new york on Monday.
But that's wonderful.
I can't wait to meet them.
Maybe we can all Go have the vodka flight at the russian samovar! We go nowhere once they see me.
My parents don't know I pregnant.
And since I not married, they will disown me.
Or worse, they will kidnap and take back to old country.
Uh Nate! Hello, nathaniel.
I'm here to see the invalid.
And not a moment too soon.
She hasn't left her room for days.
It's-it's like living with howard hughes.
blair is upstairs.
I hope you can make some headway with her.
I am not allowed to cross the transom.
Well, I'll do my best.
Great.
He sent good cop.
chuck didn't send me.
Serena.
Look, we're concerned about our best friends.
And whatever he did, I'm sure you can find a suitable punishment for him.
There is no punishment for what he did.
You're blair waldorf.
"punishment" is your middle name.
 Just tell me what happened.
I can't tell anyone.
It's too awful.
There's no such thing as "too awful" between friends.
We don't judge, remember? And we can forgive anything.
You can't tell anyone, especially not serena.
Not a soul.
I promise.
What did chuck tell you about how he got his hotel back? He didn't.
He just said "money solves everything.
" He didn't use money.
He used me As a trade.
Come on.
No way.
He set me up to sleep with jack In exchange for his beloved empire.
So now do you see why I couldn't tell anyone? Oh, my god.
My slavic language skills are a little rusty, But I'm pretty sure she just said, "over my dead goat.
" Or "body.
" the words are very similar.
Cyrus, come away from there.
Eavesdropping on the help is undignified.
plus, it confuses them.
Oh, I haven't heard that much overwrought polish drama Since I canceled my b.
A.
M.
Subscription.
What is going on? From what I can gather, dorota's in a bind.
She needs to be married before her parents show up on Monday.
Dorota, I- I-I don't understand this.
Why can't you and vanya just go down to city hall? Never.
First marriage happen at polish city hall.
You were married before? Yes.
I am divorce.
And one reason is because first wedding happen at city hall, Ignoring tradition.
Wedding traditions very sacred in my country.
dorota, don't be foolish.
Every marriage I know fail if wedding has no tradition.
Where did you and mr.
Harold get married? I don't think that's the reason The marriage didn't work out.
This not way it's supposed to be.
Miss blair and I talk about what wedding with vanya will be like.
It's supposed to be big, Grand, Perfect.
Blair does love herself a wedding.
If I may interject thank you for keeping my secret.
Hey, no problem.
I'm just gonna tell serena to hold off On the interrogation of you and Chuck.
Miss blair, I am getting married! Of course you are.
I mean tomorrow.
Mr.
Chuck is Throwing us traditional polish/russian wedding.
He said you two back together He did? Which is best news ever.
Traditional wedding must have Happy couple who escort bride and groom into chapel.
Is necessary for good luck in marriage.
Please, miss blair, Mr.
Chuck, Will you be happy couple for vanya and me? Well, uh, I can't speak for blair, But it would be my great pleasure.
Poor b.
Just realized That chuck will do anything to keep the flame alive.
Hello, beautiful.
Glad you came.
As for serena, Looks like she's playing with fire.
these venues will not do.
I know I said traditional, But bing it.
Have you ever checked out the astoria world manor? It's queens' answer to the grand ballroom at the plaza.
Thank you, charles.
You didn't know about that? You look like you need a task.
What I need is a zofran.
All this disingenuous generosity is making me want to vomit.
There's nothing disingenuous about it.
I'm happy I can give dorota and vanya The dream wedding that they deserve.
The only reason you're giving it is So that you can spend time with me.
You know weddings are my weakness.
Really? It never occurred to me.
Everything occurs to you, chuck.
Blair You and I are magnetic.
You can feel it.
Our pull is as undeniable as ever.
it's different this time.
It doesn't have to be.
I love you.
Saying it was hard, but I did, and I've never looked back.
So now I'm asking you, please do this for me.
Please forgive me.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
Oh, yes! Thank god you're here.
I need help with the flowers.
No, I wish I was kidding.
well, I'm no florist, but I've received Enough flowers in my day to know a thing or two.
I'm all yours.
croissant? Oh, yum.
I'm starved.
What, was rufus' waffle iron broken? No, but this is gonna be a long day.
Show me those flower choices.
 Okay, so my tisch application is in the mail, Vanessa's out of town, And I just ate about 5 pounds of bisquick.
Food coma film festival? Who's with me on the couch? I'm thinking kieslowski's "double life of veronique.
" you're in luck, dan.
We all just scored front-row seats To a live version of a polish production.
Vanya and dorota are Getting married tomorrow in queens, and they've asked me To throw them a, uh, traditional eastern european game night Tonight, whatever that means.
Also, eleanor asked If you and your sewing machine were free.
Um, already on my way.
You know what? I'm gonna come with you.
Is it to help me sew or to stalk your new crush? It's not stalking if you know each other.
who's the lucky guy? Um, his name is elliot.
I met him during nate's party.
We've been texting, but I don't know if he's being flirty Or friendly, so Yeah, eric refuses to ask him out Until he knows if he's gay or not.
Well, it could be totally embarrassing If I assume one thing and he actually means another.
Mm-hmm.
come on, stalker.
 It's too bad lily's gonna miss the party.
And the wedding.
You could ask her to come back from canyon ranch early.
I mean, how many massages can one person get? This is cece and lily we're talking about.
Cece needs her.
So do you.
Just ask her to come home, be your date.
It'll be romantic.
Heading to the florist? Are you going With the calla lilies or the casablancas? you know what, chuck? Don't even bother.
I know what you did.
Blair told you.
Yeah, she did.
She didn't want to, but she did.
I mean, this time you have crossed a line.
In your rush to pass judgment, Did you ever consider you don't know the entire truth? What exactly did blair say? That you traded her for the hotel.
No.
No, you deserve to be alone.
I may be heartless, but you're naive.
I made the deal, Sure, but blair didn't know that when she went to jack.
I guess she left that part out.
I can feel your brain strain, nathaniel.
I don't expect you to understand.
What's that supposed to mean? You and serena have it easy.
Until now your biggest concern is whose hair is shinier.
Did she tell you where she was this morning? She went to breakfast at the humphreys'.
What does it matter? Well, did she tell you carter baizen's back in town? Because my friend at the st.
Regis did, And guess who he saw with carter this morning.
No, you have no idea what you're even talking about.
No, you have no idea what I'm talking about, And that's the problem.
If you'll excuse me, I was heading out.
Hey.
What are you doing hiding up here? I just needed to be alone.
B.
, I know you and chuck Are going through a hard time right now, But don't you at least think what he did was romantic? Oh, my god.
This was your idea.
No.
I-I may have encouraged him to make a gesture, But throwing a whole wedding was his idea.
That's the thing with him, s.
Everything is a game.
But that's what makes you guys so good together.
You-you love games.
It's who you are.
The last game we played, we both lost.
You and nate are lucky.
You're so good to each other.
No games, no lies, no secrets, Just pure honesty- That's how it's supposed to be.
I know that now.
How do you do it? You just- you just do, I guess.
I hope it all works out.
Nate archibald.
What are you doing here, baizen? Oh, I'm just dropping something off to serena.
How about you stay away form my girlfriend? What do you want from her, anyway? she's the one who wants something, And it looks like I'm the only one who can give it to her.
I guess she hasn't told you what that is, huh? What can I say? She trusts me more than you.
I gotta run, But, uh, if you need anything, I'll be at the st.
Regis.
Of course, serena already knows that.
was that who I think it was? Was serena at breakfast with you guys this morning? Yeah.
No.
Why? Did she say she was? eleanor.
Darling.
Sweetheart, I found the perfect gift for dorota and vanya.
It's gonna knock your socks off! that's wonderful, dear.
So much to do! Finally, jenny.
Hi.
Did you get the silk netting? Enough to make monique lhuillier weep.
Oh, good girl.
Oh, serena.
Here.
This is for you.
Where'd you get this? Uh, from nate, who got it from carter.
Surprise, s.
A special delivery, courtesy of little j.
I guess good things don't always come in small packages.
Now it is time to play Traditional eastern european wedding games.
Some of these games date all the way back to 14th century, But back then they used virgins.
And today Not so much.
first game we play is balloon game.
Everybody must find partner.
You take balloon and put in between.
Now when music changes, you and partner get closer.
Ah.
Now whoever does not pop balloon wins game.
Oh! And winner Gets rare matryoshka doll.
Whoo! Oh, yeah.
Okay, let's play.
Hey.
Traditions since the 14th century? What's next, raping and pillaging? I'm guessing you didn't see elliot.
I waited in the lobby for, like, three hours.
I beat my high score in "brickbreaker.
" Maybe I should just give up.
No.
No, no, no.
Quitting is for losers, Except oprah can get away with it and, uh, maybe nate and serena.
jenny.
What? Serena's my sister and nate's my friend.
I just want to make sure they're okay.
That's all.
Really.
 chuck bass.
I hear a lot about you.
You're infamous in brighton beach.
I'm guessing so are you.
But if you'll excuse me We've done something like this before, remember? No talking.
Just dance.
 I should have told you about carter.
I bumped into him on the street the other day, And I told him we could have coffee, and that's it.
Well, that's not how carter made it seem.
You know how he is.
He convinced his fourth grade class at dalton That barneys was named after the dinosaur.
He's a liar.
Nate, if he made it seem like anything other than coffee, Then he was just trying to upset you.
And obviously, he succeeded.
Come on, nate.
This is me you're talking to.
You have to trust me.
You don't trust me? Why should I trust you? Okay, the only reason we're having This conversation right now is because you got caught.
I was going to tell you.
When, after the fact? Why didn't you just tell me when it happened? Because here you go.
Thank you.
Daniel.
Where's your partner? Uh, she-she's in vermont.
I was thinking about sitting this one out.
Oh.
Well, if you're not going to dance, At least make yourself useful.
These russians drink more than larry hagman on his first liver.
bartender needs more ice.
Yeah, you-you do know that I'm not working this party, right? Mm-hmm.
All right, I'll do it.
Thank you.
Hey! Hey.
Cyrus, what the hell has gotten into you? Dorota's gift is finalized.
The papers are signed.
Papers? What papers? Did you get her a puppy? Even better.
an apartment.
an apartment.
Have you gone crazy? I was thinking more of a vera wang cake knife.
A cake knife is not enough.
Okay.
The apartment is great.
It's in queens, An easy commute on the subway.
Why does dorota need an apartment in queens When she lives in a penthouse on the upper east side? She's getting married.
They have a baby on the way.
I figured- you figured wrong.
Getting dorota an apartment is highly inappropriate.
She's just a maid, for goodness sake.
But dorota's family.
She practically raised blair.
so your balloon burst, too? Let me guess- you overheard me and serena.
Yeah.
Kinda couldn't help it.
Look, I love serena, but I also know how she is.
I get it.
It's-it's hard to know the truth with her.
Maybe I overreacted, right? I get to talk to all my exes.
Maybe it's okay she had coffee with the guy.
Yeah.
Do you know what was in the envelope That carter gave her? I don't know.
I didn't open it.
Well, we could peek inside her v.
B.
H Jenny, you can't go through serena's purse.
Why would serena need a key to the st.
Regis? Miss blair, you go down! Too easy.
Looks like we might win.
Well, you can have the doll.
I'm sure you'll know what to do With five women with removable heads.
Whatever the prize You have to admit Together, we can't lose.
No matter how many weddings you plan, Nothing can fix what happened.
What I did was wrong.
I'm sorry.
But no one forced you to go up there.
I forced myself for you.
You didn't even know- I know.
I just this game is over.
whoo! ooh! yeah!
Hey.
You okay? No, I'm not.
Why do you even care? You've always thought the worst of chuck and me.
You think we're horrible, depraved, soulless.
And I may have used all of those words at one point or another, But I-I'm sorry.
I'm not following.
What's going on? Did-did chuck Did chuck do something? No, it's not just what he did.
It's what I did.
This whole time I was blaming him, but it was me, too.
I've become the person you always thought I was.
Look, blair, you're not- I don't think you're that bad of a person- Maybe not my type, but you're not terrible.
And-and whatever it is that happened between you and chuck, I'm sure you can fix it, because if there was A pair meant for one another, you know, it's-it's you two.
You're absolutely right.
Chuck and blair.
Blair and chuck.
I mean, who else could love me after what I've become? Thank you for helping me see it, humphrey.
Your ice is melting.
Hi.
This is rufus humphrey.
I've left a few messages For my wife lily and haven't heard back, And she didn't call me at our usual time.
No, I know you have rules about no phone.
Uh, lily humphrey? Maybe it's under lily van der woodsen? Bass? Rhodes? Looks like lily's caught in a lie.
Okay.
I-I must have gotten the dates wrong.
Thanks.
Guess it's the truth that's getting massaged.
Everything you said last night was true.
We do belong together.
We're both sick and twisted.
If you think about it, We're incredibly fortunate to have even found each other.
Blair, I don't want this to be you settling, Some sort of consolation.
We've both hit rock bottom, chuck, But we've hit it together.
At least we won't be lonely in hell.
That's not what we're - I should see if anyone needs me.
I thought you'd be happy.
any luck with that elliot guy? Uh, no.
He never showed.
Mm.
Ah, well, maybe vanya will have a cute gay cousin.
Look, should we be worried that your dad isn't coming? Uh, well, I-I think he was hoping that lily would show up, But it'll be fine.
Thanks.
hello.
You've reached the voice mail for celia rhodes.
Please leave a message.
Uh, cece, hi.
It's rufus.
I don't know where you and lily are, But I know it's not canyon ranch.
We need to talk.
in russian tradition, Before a groom can marry his bride, The wedding party gathers and demands That he answer a series of questions about his beloved.
If he's unable to answer these questions To the satisfaction of the crowd, The wedding cannot proceed.
Vanya, are you ready? Yeah.
That was an awkward car ride.
Nate, you barely said two words to me.
Look, I know you're still mad, But I want to tell you the truth.
Then you can start by telling me What you were doing in carter's hotel room.
I found the key, serena.
You went through my bag? Carter is helping me find my dad.
Oh, was he in carter's hotel room? Nate, I love you.
I'm not interested in carter.
Then why do you still have secrets with him? I was nervous to tell you that I was still looking for my dad.
I- I felt-I felt stupid, Like-like I'd be disappointing you.
Look, I told you the truth.
I don't know what else you want me to do.
I want you to stop seeing him.
I know you're upset, but that doesn't give you The right to tell me who I can and can't see.
With carter, yes, it does.
This is the final question- What do you love most about dorota? oh, this is tough question.
There's so many things I love about her.
But I think what I love most is the way I feel with her.
With dorota, I am best possible version of myself.
I have peace in my heart, Knowing I will be good husband, good father.
I will die proud russian man, Very much in love.
aw! now you may officially greet your bride.
And now It's time to get married! So Will the happy couple Who will be escorting dorota and vanya into the chapel Please step forward? Miss blair, are you I can't do this.
Miss blair.
I can't keep pretending, and I can't lie to you, dorota.
Chuck and I aren't happy At all, And if we walk you in, your marriage will be jinxed.
I'm I'm sorry.
I can't.
Poor chuck.
Looks like he's got a runaway bridesmaid on his hands.
I should have realized That something was still wrong with you and mr.
Chuck.
But you always tell me everything.
I couldn't admit it to anyone.
I could barely admit it to myself.
And I didn't want to let you down.
I'm sorry I ruined your wedding, dorota.
Does vanya hate me? No.
Miss blair, I came to america To start new life, To make new traditions.
And lucky for me, I find great people to do this with.
I find my family.
When I saw how happy you and vanya are, I realized how unhappy I am.
I wish you to be like me one day, To find right love, Good love.
I don't need you to be happy couple, miss blair.
I just need you to be happy.
ahem.
Come on, ladies.
You have an aisle to walk down.
I just got your text.
What are you doing here? I - I told you to stay away.
I just got another call from my p.
I.
About your dad.
What'd he say? He has his exact location, just a 3-hour plane ride away.
You ready for this? I don't know how long he'll stay there.
It's now or never.
What are you doing? Everything's booked.
This is your chance.
This time won't be like the last.
I'm gonna make him see me.
Thattagirl.
Wait.
I-I should tell someone I'm leaving.
No, there's no time.
Call from the car.
Did I miss anything? No.
Hi, eric.
Hi.
Elliot, what are you doing here? I love dorota.
We're tight now.
We talked about "the vampire diaries" In the elevator on Friday.
I was hoping you'd be here.
Here I am.
Uh, this- This is jenny, my stepsister.
Hi.
And I'm chelsey, his girlfriend? sorry.
you were right.
Dorota is family.
I guess I was just too scared to admit it, Because I didn't want to think that anyone else Could have raised my daughter better than I could have.
But you're a great mother.
I could have been better.
But there was some stuff that happened before you came along.
Wait.
Did you really mean what you said? Yes.
When your uncle threw me out- Wait.
He threw you out? you didn't actually Why are you laughing? 'cause nothing happened.
This was all for nothing.
It's not nothing.
I-I didn't do it, but I would have.
I want what dorota and vanya have- Real love, Pure and simple love.
You'd be bored within five minutes.
Better bored than ashamed of myself.
I would do anything for you, chuck.
But what if that's wrong? I never thought it was possible to love someone too much, But maybe it is.
I don't like who I've become with you.
Wait.
Blair Don't bail on me.
We have to see this through to the end.
This is the end, chuck.
Hey.
Have you seen serena? She missed the whole ceremony.
What's the matter? Um I didn't want to have to be the one to tell you this, But, uh, Serena left with carter.
Only a few short hours Until you'll be reunited with your dad.
What's the first thing you're gonna say To dr.
Daddy van der woodsen? Carter, how long have you known my dad's in palm beach? I don't know.
A day or two? Fine.
A week.
A week? You've known this entire time, and you haven't told me? Nate was right.
You were using this to get closer.
I was still seeing if there's something between us, And there obviously is.
What's the big deal? I have a boyfriend who I love very much.
archibald? You're really gonna settle for that? Can you stop the car, please? Get out.
What? Don't be like this.
You're just nervous about seeing your dad.
I don't need your help anymore or ever again.
I should have done this on my own from the start.
Fine.
If that's what you want.
Keep going, please.
I have a plane to catch.
Good-bye, baizen.
Hello, palm beach.
With carter out of the picture, It looks like serena's making room for daddy.
One, two, three! Mazel tov! Thank you.
This is for you and this one's for you, From cyrus And me.
It's the keys to an apartment in queens And it's your apartment in queens! an apartment! Oh! Thank you! Oh! Ohh.
Thank you, dorota, For Everything.
Miss eleanor, you've been so kind to me all these years.
Oh.
I always think of you like a mother.
Maybe big sister.
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.
Oh, have good health.
We got apartment! An apartment! Cece.
No, thanks for calling me back.
I was afraid you might not.
Of course.
I got your message.
What's been bothering you? I love my wife, but I've had it with all her lies.
Tell me what's going on or I'm- I'm walking out this door And I'm never looking back.
Oh, rufus, you're right that lily's not with me, But more than that, it's not my place to say.
I'm afraid you'll need to get the rest from lily.
I'm sorry.
Maybe we should get some champagne.
Bartender, a bottle and two glasses.
sure thing.
Now Just to clarify, I do think you deserve To be with someone who makes you happy.
Well, coming as it does from someone Who dates vanessa abrams, it means very little to me.
But still, thank you, humphrey.
Care for a dance? I guess.
Follow me.
Hey.
Come on, chuck.
What are you doing? Don't look so surprised.
I'm single now.
This is who I am.
Hey.
Wanna dance? Um, shouldn't you be doing that with your girlfriend? Chelsey took off.
We kind of got into a fight.
Sorry.
I'm not.
No, she was mad because I kept talking about this guy That I met in the lobby of my building.
And then I dragged her out to a wedding in queens.
I guess I'm a little obsessed.
I don't get it.
You like girls.
But I also like boys.
And I like you.
Let's go.
hey, serena.
It's jenny, Answering, uh, nate's phone.
Jenny, I'm so glad you picked up.
Do you know where nate is? Um, no.
I don't see him right now.
Okay, um, if you find him, Can you just please tell him to call me back as soon as he can? Also, just tell him That I love him and I don't want any more secrets.
Yeah, sure.
If I, uh, if I see him, I'll give him the message.
Thank you, jenny.
I appreciate it.
While most people think It's our brain that controls our actions, It is often our heart that gets the biggest workout.
Hey, you wanna dance? Um, yeah.
It can make us do the craziest of things, But it can also let us take a chance on new adventures.
Because when we open our heart, We can explore a world of love And be pleasantly surprised by the people already in our life.
But unfortunately, our hearts are very sensitive, And when they're broken, Everything around us is shattered.
Hello? Dad? Serena.
Mom.
Um Total eclipse of the heart.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, gossip girl.
gossip girl here-your one and only source Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
We have to see this through to the end.
This is the end, chuck.
I didn't know you were applying To the tisch writing program.
I'm kinda not telling anyone.
That doesn't give you the right to tell me Who I can and can't see.
With carter, yes, it does.
I just got another call from my p.
I.
About your dad.
He has his exact location, just a 3-hour plane ride away.
do you know where nate is? um, no, I don't see him right now.
If you find him, can you just please tell him To call me back as soon as he can? serena left with carter.
Uh, cece.
Hi, it's rufus.
I don't know where You and lily are, but I know it's not canyon ranch.
Hello? Dad? Serena.
On the upper east side, New days don't always bring new beginnings, But they almost always bring new surprises.
Oh, god.
Waffles.
You don't like waffles? It's not a matter of like.
It's-it's I'm a humphrey, so syrup is a food group.
Yeah, how are you not, like, 500 pounds? Nice shirt, by the way.
Oh.
Yeah, sorry.
I, uh, it looked really comfy to sleep in.
Oh, yeah, it's serena's favorite as well.
So you still haven't heard from her? Nope.
Radio silence since she left with carter.
I'm not gonna be the first one to call her, you know? Yeah, well, hey, thanks For letting me crash here last night.
I'm sorry you had to sleep on the couch.
I have no idea how it got so late.
Well, time flies when you're having A wii tennis death match, humphrey.
Oh, did you call your dad, by the way? Uh, yeah, but I said that I was staying at sawyer's, So if anyone asks, you're an insecure brunette Who has an unnatural love for designer handbags.
um, hey, are we still on For the tim burton exhibit at moma? Absolutely.
Oh, it's serena.
"just landed.
So sorry.
Call you when I'm home.
" You know what? I think I'm gonna- I think I'm gonna shower and just go over there.
Um, are you sure? I mean, she said she was gonna call you.
You don't- you don't wanna push, right? Yeah, I think-just-if we talk, it should be in person.
Rain check on moma? Sure.
Okay.
Mm.
 oh, oh, oh  You ready? To explain to rufus the real reason I've been lying to him? No.
But I know I have to.
Well, it's rufus.
He'll understand.
Yeah, let's hope.
You know, it's hard enough to tell him, But now with your father involved- William and rufus do not exactly get along.
Mm, nothing like a grunge-era love triangle.
Yes, well, complete with an unplanned pregnancy, A trip to a french sanatorium, my mother And a whole lot of flannel.
It was ugly In more ways than one.
Well, it'll be okay, mom.
I'm here for you.
Oh.
It's a lot easier to sneak up on someone When you're not eight months pregnant And they're not standing in front of a full-length mirror.
Are the caterers all set up downstairs? Uh, yes.
Everything is set up.
Miss blair, I not so sure this party your best idea.
What if we go feed ducks in park, just the two of us? Dorota, why did I go to the trouble Of putting together an elegant brunch and inviting A dozen of manhattan's most eligible bachelors? So world can know miss blair's single again, And chuck bass thing of past.
Mm-hmm.
But miss blair not yet grieve properly.
To rush back into dating- Will show everyone that chuck bass has no hold over me.
Dorota, you really need to stop buying your prenatal vitamins Over the internet.
For this I postpone honeymoon.
Will you toss out that box of junk? I never want to see it again.
Lily? Hello, rufus.
Will, what the hell are you doing here? I'm here to see lily.
Is she home? If she was, you still wouldn't be welcome.
You need to leave now.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
Yeah, I know about this summer.
You've done enough damage to this family, on all fronts.
This summer.
She, uh, she hasn't told you? Told me what? I think we should wait for lily.
We a all have a lot to talk about.
There is an outlet by the bed, And I will be in in a minute.
You look like hell.
Small price to pay to feel like heaven.
Where's archibald? Don't tell me you two finally Closed the deal.
I have no idea what you're talking about, chuck.
Please.
You've been panting at his loafers Ever since serena went m.
I.
A.
With carter.
Was it as you always imagined? Late night? You two engaged in a sweaty wii duel Your bodies touch He looks at you like he's never looked at you before.
Oh, you're an ass, chuck.
Besides, serena's back.
Oh, well, maybe now you'll actually have a chance.
Don't worry.
The odds of me remembering this conversation are slim.
Wait.
What do you mean, I'll stand a chance now? Archibald's never gonna cross the line.
He's a good guy.
He would cling to serena's golden locks Until she pushes him away.
Yeah, but why would she do that? I mean, he's been totally patient and understanding.
You and I know that, But if she were to think nate had, in fact, betrayed her, She would drive him into your waiting arms in no time.
Why are you telling me all this? Because If I want my friend back, This would be done easier with serena out of the picture.
Now all you need is something to make her suspicious.
Lily told me that she renovated this place again.
It's come a long way since we first moved in.
There have been a lot of improvements since you left, Which is why you won't be staying.
Lily.
Oh.
Rufus, hello.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Oh.
Oh, god.
William.
Dad? Serena.
Paging serena van der woodsen.
After a lifetime in the daddy waiting room, It looks like the doctor is finally in.
William, what's going on? I was just about to ask you that, lily.
Rufus, um, It wasn't my mother who was sick.
It was me.
And that's why william and I were together last summer.
Uh, he wasn't treating cece.
He was treating me.
Mom said that's why you wouldn't see me When I came looking for you.
I wanted to see you, but as her doctor, I couldn't tell you why I was there, and I-I didn't wanna lie.
How are you feeling now? Good.
I'm feeling good.
And I just had my 6-month checkup, And, uh, we'll get the results soon.
Yeah, well, the one bright spot Is that lily's illness is very treatable.
We're just waiting on the last round of test results, But, uh, I'm highly optimistic that it hasn't returned.
Hmm.
Lily, I'm so sorry you've been, uh, Going through this Alone.
I would just like to move forward As if everything is normal.
And, uh, just please keep this between us.
And there will be no mention of the "c" word in this house.
and I am gonna go freshen up.
Mmm.
Lily, you-you and I still need to talk.
Yeah.
Uh, my family and I need some time alone.
Um Sure.
Listen, I, uh, Know that this is a lot for you to take in.
Can I convince you to go somewhere and talk? If eric's around, I would love for him to join us.
He's in andover with the debate team.
But, um, let me just change.
Where-where should I meet you? I'm at 60 thompson.
You okay? Yeah.
After all he's done for my mom, I at least owe him a conversation.
Mm.
"we regret to inform you "that due to the high volume of qualified applicants, "the dramatic writing program At the tisch school of the arts" We, uh, have decided to crush your dreams With this form letter.
Apparently, there was- there's only one spot For transfer students, and I didn't get it, so This is really terrible.
No, vanessa, it's, uh, it's okay.
I mean, it sucks, yeah, but I'll survive.
No, it's not that.
it's just It was me.
I, um, I got the spot.
What? I should have told you I was applying For dramatic writing as well as film and tv.
I just-I honestly didn't think I had a shot.
It was only after I wrote that short that I started thinking How great would it be if we both got in? Wait.
So-so you got the spot? I would have never applied If I'd had known they were only taking one transfer from n.
Y.
U.
You got in.
Wow.
Wow.
Well, I mean, congratulations.
No, seriously, seriously, If it wasn't gonna be me, um, I'm glad it was you.
You are? Yeah, sure, you know, And they-they also "wish me success in my future endeavors.
" So it's not a total loss.
Listen, I gotta get to a-a study group, But, um, I don't know.
I think we should celebrate.
There's an art party tonight in bushwick.
It should be tisch student central.
What do you say? Are you sure? Please.
Come on.
Ain't no party like a bushwick party.
I'll call you later.
All right.
Why didn't you tell me? I don't know.
You have every right to be mad at me.
I don't want to be mad.
I I just want to understand.
Lily Talk to me.
I was scared.
I was more scared than I've ever been.
And telling you, Having to see the look on your face- I couldn't bear it.
And then when will said that the minute People start treating you like you're sick- Especially your loved ones- That your body starts to listen to it, and I I guess I just used that as an excuse.
Um Because I knew the minute I told you, It would all become so real.
So, uh, will told you not to tell me? Everything that he has done And everything that he has said has worked.
I know, and that's all that's important.
Was I not clear? Did I not instruct you to send out invitations to my bachelors With the date, time and location clearly marked? I did.
All invitations go out.
Then how do you explain this? Did you send the invitations by carrier pigeon? I- is the elevator broken? A meteor headed for earth? You were against this from the start.
What did you do? I do nothing.
Then I don't understand.
You.
You.
Come here.
You're a guy.
I invited a dozen eligible bachelors today, And not one of them showed up.
You'd be thrilled to date me, wouldn't you? Yeah.
You're totally hot.
Miss blair.
Please.
Maybe this is sign.
I remember when I separate from first husband- Dorota, I need answers That don't end in "and then I came to america.
" Wait.
What did you say? Um, first husband? Oh.
Of course.
Chuck.
What is mr.
Chuck to do with this? Isn't it obvious? He's declared a dating fatwa on me.
Serena.
Hey.
W- when did you get back? I just got in, and by the looks of it, so did you.
Yeah.
I, um, I spent the night at a friend's house.
So what's up? Uh, for starters, I'm about to go see my father.
Your father? Wow.
That's amazing.
Yeah.
Look, jenny, I would love to catch up, but I gotta run.
Yeah.
Is that Is that nate's shirt? What? No.
You spent the night at a friend's? Um Look, serena, I kinda crashed at nate's last night, But we were just hanging out, And we totally lost track of time.
I mean, he slept on the couch.
Like, you have to believe me.
You-you do, right? Yeah, of course.
Look, my-my dad is waiting.
Here.
You'll probably see him before I do.
Yeah.
Dan! I'm glad I ran into you.
Oh, hi.
Are you okay? Oh, so I-I take it you heard? I'm so sorry.
I was really looking forward to you being at tisch next year.
Yeah.
Honestly, I never really thought she'd get it.
Wait.
So even you knew that vanessa was applying? And you didn't.
Wow.
That hurts.
Yeah, on a few levels, like the fact that her submission Was based on my story in "the new yorker," but Yeah, whatever.
Dan, you know submissions have to be original works, right? Well, I mean, I'm-I'm sure she didn't do it on purpose.
It's fine.
If I'm not gonna get in, It might as well go to vanessa, you know? You know how my dad's on the board of directors, right? He told me you were the runner-up, That it came down to you and vanessa.
Wh-you're kidding.
That was your spot.
The school has to know.
no, I'm not gonna do that to her.
She's my girlfriend.
You know, she got in, and I just- I have to deal with it.
Uh, so I'll see you later? You're-you're performing at that party in bushwick, right? Yeah, but All right, okay, well, I'll see you then.
Hi, daddy.
It's me.
Hey.
You just called me.
Why didn't you answer? And what are you doing here? Call me crazy.
I thought we should talk in person.
But you're obviously on your way out.
I'm going to meet with my father.
Whoa.
Since when? What's he doing here? It's it's complicated.
I know that's not what you want to hear right now, But if you could just wait- I've been waiting, serena.
Yeah, and were you waiting alone, Or was someone there to keep you company? What are you talking about? Nothing.
You know what? Just- just keep your secrets, nate.
You're accusing me of keeping secrets? Are you kidding me? Can we not do this right now? I have a lot going on.
Yeah, and my guess is you're not gonna tell me about any of it.
I can't.
I just- I need you to understand that.
Yeah, yeah, and you're gonna tell me everything later.
I've heard it before.
You know what? This time I'm not gonna hold my breath.
Prep the o.
R.
, kiddies.
Looks like jenny humphrey is scrubbing up To surgically remove a boyfriend.
So what's step two? Get him drunk.
Take advantage of him.
Do women just not get this? Chuck, he's not gonna go drinking with me.
He made me call my dad when I slept over.

  Be here, 6
0 sharp.
And look like someone who doesn't even have a father.
You twisted, manipulative psychopath.
How could you? You're going to have to be a tad more specific.
It's been a busy few days.
My party.
Right.
I heard about your little rebound reception.
Good for you, moving on.
So you're just gonna pretend like you have nothing to do With the fact that no one showed up? That you didn't put a dating fatwa on me? We're over, chuck.
Unclench.
To set the record straight, I didn't put a fatwa on you.
The reason no one showed up today is Because no one could ever measure up to what we had, And I'm obviously not the only guy who knows that.
Fine.
If you won't move on, I will.
There are plenty of guys outside the upper east side, And by this time tomorrow, everyone in the five boroughs Will know that chuck bass' threats mean nothing.
willa, hey.
What's up? Thank you.
I'm about to head out to bushwick, Get a vibe on the space tonight.
Mmm.
But I told my dad john about vanessa's submission.
The dean is gonna call for a review of her application.
She'll be rejected, and you'll be in.
You did what? Can't talk.
Gotta go tune my instrument.
No, no, no.
Willa- We'll celebrate tonight.
No, willa, don't- don't hang- And suddenly I found myself Caught in the middle of a civil war in the congo.
Wait.
When was that? Well, that was, uh, after hurricane mitch And before kosovo, so '98, '99.
You know, my, uh, my '98 was, uh, actually pretty similar.
We were just coming out of the civil war Between lily and the republic of claus.
Ah.
What do you say we get out of here, go to serendipity? I remember how much you used to love their banana splits.
I was 4.
You're right.
I shouldn't presume to even know you.
You know, this gulf, This chasm that's between us- It's gonna take some time, but We can make it go away.
You may be here for my mom now, But that doesn't explain the last 14 years.
You just left.
Um It-it wasn't Exactly like that.
Then what was it like? Thank you.
I'm glad you called.
How are you doing? I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Listen, um, do you remember how tisch required you To submit an original piece? Tell me about it.
I was so stressed, And then the night before the application was due, It just came to me.
Oh, what came to you? Um  Um, I would love for you to read it.
Uh, what is this? It's my piece for the application- My first original play.
It's your first original? Oh, wow.
And while it's not based on anything you've written, It was based on you.
On us, really.
I don't know what to say.
I can't watch you read, so I'm gonna head back to the dorms.
But why don't we just skip the party And order pizza? Okay.
Sounds good.
Well, the plan was to find a new home base So I could get us all out of here.
What, you-you wanted us to come? Of course.
That was the plan.
So I took the post in tibet.
I tried to commute while I got settled in.
C- commute from tibet to j.
F.
K.
? Yeah.
And I promised your mother That I would be home on a Tuesday And I would show up on Friday, the following week.
It didn't take long before she, um- Wanted a divorce, yeah.
You know, I couldn't blame her For needing consistency in her life, in your lives.
Serena, I just don't want you to think that one day I woke up And decided that I was gonna leave you And never come back.
After a while, I just didn't know how.
So that's it? You just forgot how to be a father? Last name's van der woodsen.
Let him know he has a visitor.
If you'll excuse me for a moment I've got plenty of fresh towels, rufus, But thanks for checking in.
I'm actually here to make sure you check out.
Okay, um, You don't trust me.
I get it.
If I were going by the me of 20 years ago, I wouldn't trust myself either, but, uh, people change, rufus.
Really? Because telling lily to hide her illness From me and the kids is just like the guy I used to know.
Lily needed to remain positive.
And if I may say, it worked.
Well, for that, I'm eternally grateful, But now that I'm part of this, she gets a new doctor, One I can be certain has only one agenda.
Rufus, what are you doing here? Oh, I'm sorry for intruding.
I'll see you at home.
Wait.
I'll-I'll come with you.
Serena.
I just need some time to think.
Okay? this is willa.
Leave me a message.
willa, you need to call you father And have him undo whatever it was he did Before the dean calls vanessa, because it would be- It'd be a- humphrey.
I- I'll call you.
What do you want, blair? I'm about to explain, so if you'd remain silent Until you hear the full story, I'd appreciate it.
Th-this is really not a good time.
Wow.
I'm not even close to done.
Okay, so chuck has put a dating fatwa on me.
So unless I find some guy to kiss me So I can splash it all over "gossip girl," I might as well just pack up and join a convent.
I need a night out away from the upper east side, Away from manhattan, actually.
Well, there-there was this art party that vanessa and I Were gonna go to, but I- oh, a party where you two are guests-perfect.
Brimming with young men who are not socially astute enough To fear the length of the bass arm.
Blair, I have more important things right now to- Um You know what? Actually, I'm sorry.
There is someone at that party that I need to talk to.
Wonderful.
now I'll need a disguise if I'm to blend in.
Perhaps vanessa can loan me a serape? serena, stuff between me and your dad Goes a long way back, but don't let that get in the way Of your relationship with him.
I - I won't.
Right now I just need to keep things about my mom, Think about what's best for her.
I'll see you soon.
Uh, that was william, And, um, he got the test results.
They're not what we hoped.
Art party.
Brooklyn.
She wasn't kidding.
$500 it is.
I know an r.
A.
Can use the money.
Well, you look like you could use a drink.
What's your problem? You know what you did to blair.
And I'm paying for it.
Yeah, seems like you're having the time of your life.
After all these years, You can't see through one of my smoke screens? I'm not asking for forgiveness, nathaniel.
I did what I did.
but we have been best friends Since before I can remember, and I thought I know serena went with carter, and I know she's back.
I just thought you could use a drink, Maybe get out of the city Even if it's with me.
Yeah.
Getting out of the city sounds like a good idea.
What do you have in mind? Brooklyn, actually.
And I invited along a local guide.
You guys ready? By midnight, everyone who reads "gossip girl" Will see me kissing some guy, Chuck's fatwa will kaput, and I'll have my life back.
Are you sure you wanna be here? Yeah.
I mean, it's not fair what chuck's doing to her, And I really don't want this tisch thing to come between us.
Me neither.
Okay, I'm gonna go find my sacrificial lamb and the bar.
Um, I should follow her, Because I do not want her to spill on my pleather leggings.
 I'll get some drinks.
I don't know why you invited jenny.
What, I thought you two were as thick as wiis.
Yeah, but not for a night out drinking.
I mean, she's still just a kid.
She's a junior, older than serena when the two of you Christened the campbell apartment.
And honestly, Does she look like a kid to you?  So Columbia? I'm impressed.
This doesn't really seem like an ivy league party.
What are you doing here? Ah, I'm friends with the guy who owns the loft.
Oh, god.
Is that an aaron rose? Uh, pretty sure that's ikea.
not bad, columbia.
Name's cameron.
Blair.
 Oh.
Is it suddenly unbearably hot in here? Oh, are you okay? Mm-hmm.
I'm better now.
thank you.
Willa.
Dan.
You're just in time.
I'm about to serve up a venti-sized serving Of artistic justice.
Please tell me that you got one of my 200 messages.
Nope.
Told you I was getting in the zone.
Were you calling to thank me? Uh, vanessa submitted an original piece, So you need to tell your dad that there's been a mistake.
So she wrote something else.
Are you telling me she belongs at tisch more than you? You deserve it.
You can thank me later.
Whoa.
I'm I'm with vanessa.
You're "with" vanessa? What are you, 40? Hi, dan.
Who was that slut? Just call your father.
Hey, jenny.
Jenny! Please tell me what you're doing here, Starting with "dad knows" And ending with "these drinks are not for me.
" uh, well, Since I haven't actually talked to dad today, no.
But these drinks are for nate and chuck.
What are you doing with nate and chuck? Well, my nate's my friend, and chuck's totally harmless Unless this place runs out of ice.
Um, does vanessa know that girl who was hitting on you? No, she wasn't Wait a second.
Why do you go from zero to blackmail in 60 seconds? Dan, it was actually a question.
a relapse is not uncommon.
We just need another round of treatment, Make some adjustments.
That's all.
No.
Rufus - I think we need a second opinion.
We're at the epicenter of the best medical care In the world, and whatever we need to do, We can do it together, here.
Well, if that's what you want, lily, of course.
I mean, I'll call a friend at sloan-kettering myself.
But, uh, even if you do go with another doctor, I'm gonna stick around, because I need to know you're well.
I think we should stay with dad.
He's already cured mom once, and-and he is family.
I think I prefer it, too, rufus.
He's already familiar with every aspect of my case, And I know what to expect of the treatment, And serena's right.
William is family.
Sure.
If that's what you want, of course.
I'll make some calls.
We'll get started first thing tomorrow.
And, like rufus says, We're, uh, all in this together.
Hey.
I wasn't expecting you.
Is this a bad time? I kinda need to talk.
No, no.
It's fine.
Are you okay? Um, things aren't really going so well.
Chuck wants us to do shots.
Is that jenny? Yeah, we're-we're sort of at this party.
Hey, uh it's serena.
I can't believe this.
why? What's wrong? Nothing.
It's just I called to talk to you, And you're at a party with-with jenny humphrey? Well, so what? It's no big deal.
Just like her spending the night wasn't a big deal? What? How do you know about that? you know what? Never mind.
I changed my mind.
I don't have anything to say to you.
Ser- Chuck, your plan sucks.
He's on the phone with serena right now.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
I'm so over this party.
Let's just go back to the suite and get hammered.
You two run along.
I'm gonna stick around for a while.
You up for it? Absolutely.
Spotted-nate archibald suffering from a broken heart.
Too bad he doesn't realize Jenny's oath is less hippocratic And more hypocrite.
Come on.
You're an art history major.
Wh-admit it.
This art is atrocious.
Oh, I don't know.
The ikea orb's growing on me.
Mm.
Actually, I have a friend who goes to columbia, Though I don't think he attends that many classes.
Blair, do you want To make that guy who showed up jealous or what? Excuse me? I saw you two.
Let me guess- your ex-boyfriend? You want to prove to him you're over him, ready to move on? Just have to take the plunge.
Show him the past is the past.
I like you.
I'm game if you are.
 I'm game.
Vanessa, where are you going? Home.
Look, I don't know what willa told you, but keep in mind, She-she carries around lighter fluid.
You told her that my tisch sample Was adapted from your story? It slipped out.
But you wrote an original piece, So you don't have anything to worry about.
You mean because willa's gonna call her father And straighten it out with the dean? Thanks, dan.
You really made sure I was off to a great start.
You're not-you're not being fair.
That was not my fault.
I asked you if you were okay with me getting in.
Why weren't you honest with me? Like you were honest with me, going behind my back To apply for the one thing I wanted more than anything? I explained that.
No.
No, you justified that.
You said yourself that if you knew there'd only been one spot, You wouldn't have applied.
What are you- what are you saying? You want me to withdraw my application? No.
No.
No, of course not.
But what were you expecting my reaction to be? I, um, I don't know.
Not this.
You're taking off? I want to get started first thing tomorrow.
There's no time to waste.
I- I still don't know what I want from you.
You know, today I was Planning on giving you a big speech on regret, But, uh, your mother's illness, Her reaching out to me, Us reconnecting I have to believe there's a purpose behind all of this.
But you've missed so much.
I know.
Um I've followed you from afar, Glimpsed a photo here and there.
Wasn't thrilled about that horse at the polo match.
That was sort of the point.
Thank you, serena.
I know you have no reason to trust or believe me, So, uh, I really appreciate the second chance.
Everyone deserves one.
Well, I'm not sure rufus would necessarily agree with that, But, uh, For what it's worth, I plan to prove him wrong.
I haven't read any posts on "gossip girl" yet.
I guess my ban works in the provinces.
I knew it.
I knew you'd fatwa'd me.
And I knew you couldn't break it.
You're wrong.
I could have.
Then why didn't you? Because I suddenly realized it.
The way to get over you Isn't by hooking up with some random guy Or pretending like we didn't happen.
You and I loved each other.
And then you broke my heart.
I've been doing everything possible not to face that fact.
I'm gonna kiss somebody someday, And when I do, It'll be for me.
Good-bye, chuck.
I'm going home.
what the hell is wrong with me? Nothing's wrong with you.
I mean, don't you know how great you are? I'm serious.
I mean-look, I probably shouldn't say this, But you've said it to me once before- You deserve someone who's gonna treat you right, Not like serena does.
It's true.
I mean I would never treat you like she does.
You deserve better, nate.
Jenny, no.
In case you've never heard one before Nate? That's the sound of a relationship flatlining.
I know what this looks like.
Oh, you do? Great.
Well, as long as you know How it looks, then-then I guess I'm good.
That's not what I meant.
Stop.
Hey.
I mean, what are you even doing here? I came to apologize for not hearing you out earlier, And then I walk in to see her trying to kiss you? Yeah, but I didn't.
Nothing happened.
Same as nothing happened last night, which I would have Told you about, if you hadn't hung up on me.
Well, so what about all the things she said about me? Is-is that really what you think? Yes, he does.
I'm talking to nate, jenny.
Well? What, do I wonder why you don't trust me anymore? Yeah, I do.
And then you leave town with carter baizen.
And then you come back and you shut me out.
What am I supposed to think? I'm sorry.
I should have told you That I was looking for my father.
But I didn't leave town with carter.
You know that.
I even tried to apologize.
What are you talking about? The night of dorota's wedding, I- I called your cell to explain everything.
I even left a message with jenny.
What message? I never talked to her, nate.
For once, please, don't let her do this to you.
I left you a message, nate.
She said she would tell you.
She's lying! I never talked to her.
Just get out.
What? Seriously, jenny, just please leave.
You know, you two deserve each other.
Oh, sorry, miss blair.
I forget to take away.
I- I know you not want to see anymore.
Hey, no.
Give me that.
it's no use to deny the past.
Chuck is a part of me.
He'll always be.
it just hurts so much.
In poland, we have a saying- "love is like head wound.
" It make you dizzy, you think you die But you recover Usually.
That's a terrible saying.
Tomorrow can we feed the ducks? I already buy bread.
Sorry.
I had to talk to my mom first.
Nate, before I-I tell you what I need to tell you, I want you to know that I do trust you.
And if I'm guilty of anything, it's taking you for granted, For assuming you'd always be around.
And I-I promise, I- I won't do that again.
Serena, what's-what's going on? To revive a struggling relationship, There comes a point When we must stop protecting what we have The reason I couldn't talk to you earlier- It's-it's not about my dad.
It was about my mom.
She's sick, And I don't know what's gonna happen.
To allow for what we truly need.
moving forward can mean reaching out  so I know which way to run  Reaching back or reaching balance.
Thank you, rufus.
I know william being back is hard for you.
All that matters is you getting better.
And while new journeys can start with a single step, They can end just as quickly with a single misstep.
hey, vanessa.
It's me.
Listen, I just read your play, and it's, uh, it's amazing.
I'm so, so sorry.
Please call me.
and when even the healthiest relationship Finds itself on life support, it's important to remember It's will.
It's not working exactly as I'd hoped.
I need you to write lily another prescription.
Well, you can't back out now.
I need you to make this work.
And I doubt the authorities Would be pleased to know what you've been doing.
On the upper east side, Sometimes the wrong prescription Is just what the doctor ordered.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, gossip girl.
Gossip girl here-your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I raided Lily's medicine cabinet.
She sometimes gets headaches.
That's a hell of a headache.
I think we need a second opinion.
Even if you do go with another doctor, - I'm gonna stick around.
Aren't you Blair Waldorf? We haven't read about you on "Gossip Girl" in forever.
You read "Gossip Girl"? Of course.
Everyone at Columbia does.
I called your cell to explain everything.
I even left a message with Jenny.
She's lying.
I never talked to her.
Just get out.
There's only one spot for transfer students, and I didn't get it.
It was me.
I got the spot.
Why weren't you honest with me? What, like you were honest with me, going behind my back to apply for the one thing I wanted more than anything? The reason I couldn't talk to you earlier it's not about my dad.
It was about my mom.
She's sick, and I don't know what's gonna happen.
It's not working exactly as I'd hoped.
I need you to write Lily another prescription.
I doubt the authorities would be pleased to know what you've been doing.
Subbed by RDV It's said that we're all strapped to fortune's wheel Nowhere is this truer than the ever-changing landscape of love.
As one couple enjoys an upswing another is plunged downwards.
But top or bottom, don't get too comfortable, because the one thing you can rely on is that the wheel will keep on turning.
All right, I'm heading to my mom's for breakfast.
Hey, hey, hey.
You're coming in late and leaving early all week.
I'm starting to feel cheap.
Oh, I'm sorry I haven't been around much lately.
Just with everything going so well with my dad Hey, Serena, no worries.
Okay? - Mm.
Look, I love being your crash pad, but, you know, maybe you'd feel better if you moved back in - with your mom while she's getting her treatment.
And have to see Jenny's lying face first thing in the morning? No, thank you.
That is not the same girl Chuck came home with last night.
Has he, uh, come to talk to Lily yet? Do you want me to talk to him? No, I already tried, but thank you.
I'm gonna come to your lacrosse game after brunch.
Judge away.
Shame turns me on.
Hey, man, she's going to Lily's for brunch.
Maybe a stack of waffles will help your hangover? I find the cause is the best cure.
I gotta go.
So I will see you later at the library, and I'm sorry about before with the Tisch catalog.
It's fine.
Dan, I don't know how to do this.
We've been tiptoeing around each other for days.
Look, we're we're two artists in a relationship, and sometimes we're gonna be competing for the same things, so, all right, we're we're we're smart people.
Let's come up with some rules, a list of topics that are off-limits.
Isn't that what got us in trouble with Tisch? No, no.
This will be different, because we'll know what we don't know.
Hey, listen to me.
I'm quoting Donald Rumsfeld.
Okay, until the sting of Tisch has worn off, I I don't think we should talk about classes.
Like, if if you're taking playwriting with Sam Shepard, it may hurt my heart, but if you take intro to mime, I need to know everything.
I want to be with you when you buy your leotard and your beret.
Playwriting competitions I think we can go out for the same ones, but we can't read each other's submissions.
And looking forward, I guess it's the same thing with internships and jobs.
So the only things we can talk about openly are are politics, "Jersey Shore" And where we want to eat which reminds me, I actually, um, I need to get ready.
I'm gonna be late for breakfast at my dad's.
Are you sure you don't want to come? No, I'm sorry.
I, uh, I have something.
Oh, oh, is it something related to our list? Actually, yeah.
Well, thank you for not sharing.
See? I can't believe how much easier that is.
Ooh! Another sext session with your new b.
f.
? Okay, I'd hardly call Elliot a boyfriend.
Between me spending all my time with my mom and him being in every club in school, we haven't even been on a first date.
Hey.
Still using cooking as therapy? - Yeah.
Ooh.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Good morning, everyone.
Oh, look at all of this food.
It's obscene.
You okay? How are you feeling? - Can I get you something? Please, everyone, relax.
What I need is for the people who love me to treat me like they always do.
Has anybody heard from Chuck? Yeah, uh, he's he's sorry he couldn't make it.
Charles has the right idea.
If he were here, then I'd really worry.
Anyway, one thing I'll say about William's treatment Is that I have not lost my appetite.
I want waffles.
Music to my ears.
Dad.
What's he doing here? - I invited him.
Hmm.
Looks great, Lil.
Really great.
So I hope you'll all join me for this Doctors Without Borders gala tomorrow at Columbia.
I must admit, I feel a bit silly about the whole thing.
Clearly, Columbia's run out of alumni to honor, if the best they could come up with is me.
False humility-check.
I'll be there.
I hope you don't mind.
I invited Nate and Blair.
I really want them to get to know you.
Terrific.
I'd be honored.
Well, Rufus and I would love to come.
Uh, why don't you grab a plate? Help yourself.
What? He left when I was 2.
The man's a total stranger to me.
You have to at least give him a chance.
No, I don't.
Okay, everyone.
Let's sit down and enjoy this wonderful food.
Dad, here.
Sit here.
Rufus, scoot over, please.
Please.
Thank you.
Hey, Blair, what's up? I thought I'd come and watch your lacrosse game.
So if you could make sure that there's a seat for me in V.
I.
P.
, preferably next to an injured cute player, but not one on scholarship.
Since when do you care about lacrosse? - Since I desperately needed to get away from N.
Y.
U.
Everyone's planning their living arrangements for next year.
It's so depressing.
I thought your friends asked you to live with them.
In a postwar building on a street that's not even numbered.
It's lettered.
And its big selling point is that it's above a falafel stand.
All right, well, listen, hey, I gotta go.
There's no V.
I.
P.
area, but there's a nice set of bleachers.
Blair? You probably don't remember us, but we met you at your mom's fashion show.
Uh, yeah, of course.
Hair band girl.
I never forget a good accessory.
We're celebrating.
We just got the most amazing apartment ever.
You would totally approve prewar, doorman, and the best part Fauchon is supposedly opening up next door.
Can I ask you something? What do you think about falafel? Ew.
Isn't that the kind of food paralegals eat? I never thought I'd see Blair Waldorf on the upper West Side.
Unless oh, my God.
Are you transferring to Columbia? - I hope so.
N.
Y.
U.
is so beneath you.
I it's true! I'm a Columbia girl now.
As you should be.
Yay! You know, the last time I was invited to a ceremony in my honor, I had to slaughter a chicken.
Well, at least you've been honored.
I've I've never been honored, I did win a contest once at boarding school, and I think there was a plaque, - but I'm not sure that really counts.
What kind of contest? It was for drinking hot chocolate - at the winter fair.
I had a buddy that went to Exeter, and the stories he tells would make Keith Richards blush.
Yeah, well, um I wasn't really into the party scene.
I was there more for the academics.
It sounds like you've made some great choices, Serena.
I'm glad.
The bad ones have a way of following you.
You know, I've never heard that hot chocolate story.
Yeah, well, there are a lot of stories you haven't heard.
True, but I did hear this one.
My ex-boyfriend went to boarding school with Serena, and he tells a great one about her and this teacher one night - at a bed-and-breakfast - Jenny.
Although I'm sure they were just studying.
You know, like she says, she was all about the academics.
I have an announcement, everyone.
I've decided I'm moving back in.
That way, I can be here with you, mom.
And it'll just be really great to be back in my old room again.
Don't worry, Jenny.
We'll we'll find a place for you.
Well, that's great, because I'm moving in, too.
Downstairs.
I was waiting to tell you until the board approved my sublet tomorrow.
But I'm very excited.
All my family together under one roof again.
Better watch out, Humphreys.
They say love makes a family, but on the Upper East Side, everyone knows it's real estate.
Hey, dad, I'm sorry I'm running so late.
Can you save me a waffle? - Always.
I'll put one in the oven for you.
Uh, how's Lily? - She's great.
And you? How you holding up? I mean, it must be weird.
Lily's ex-husband is now her doctor.
It was at first.
But the fact is, - he's just her doctor now.
I'm her husband.
Uh, by the way, Vanessa can't make it.
Said she had to be somewhere.
Oh, right.
The, um, internship at CNN.
They called me as one of the references she listed.
Ah.
Yeah, I I wouldn't know.
She and I are keeping our creative lives separate right now.
Uh, you might wanna discuss this one, since it involves her going to Haiti for three months.
You know what, dad? - I think I'm gonna have to cancel that waffle.
Okay.
All right.
See you.
Hey.
Um I know this gala tomorrow night seems boring, but I thought, uh, if there's a girl you like, - perhaps you'd like to invite her.
Actually, I'm gay.
So if I was going, which I'm not, then my date would be a guy named Elliot.
That's cool.
Uh Bring Elliot.
I'd love to meet him Please stop acting like you and I have any kind of relationship.
You're right.
Um I have a lot to make up for.
I'm sorry.
The window for that closed somewhere between my 12th birthday and, um My suicide attempt.
Don't worry.
I'm fine now.
Going through all that without a father made me realize that I don't need one.
I understand that I've lost the right to be a father to you, but If there's any way that we can get to know each other on your terms Serena may want a relationship with you, but I don't.
Serena, stop it! You can't do that.
The room was on loan, and I'm taking it back.
And I don't care if I did leave it in the closet.
Borrowing without asking is stealing, Jenny.
Dad, tell her to stop! Uh, Serena, please.
I think it's great that you're moving back in, but this is Jenny's room now.
All her things are here.
You can stay in Chuck's old room.
No way.
That room is haunted by Chuck's depravity.
Jenny can take it.
I'm sure it wouldn't bother you.
Okay, what what's going on with you two? Nothing.
Fine.
Whatever.
Serena can have her old room back.
All right, that's ridiculous.
Serena, I'll have Laryssa make up Chuck's bed for you.
I'm confident that there's no depravity that brand-new E.
Braun sheets can't erase.
How many problems does Jenny have to cause before you realize she's the problem? Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for meeting me here.
The library started did you apply for a documentary internship in Haiti? Yeah.
The producer just called.
I I got the job.
When were you planning on telling me about this? This morning, and then you put internships on the "do not discuss" list, - and I panicked.
Why? Why? This is not about competing for something.
This is this is about our relationship.
But both of those have been so tied up in each other, and this job is a huge deal for me, Dan.
But you can't pretend like you going away for three months - is not gonna affect us.
I think I didn't wanna face that.
It was just so much easier when we were just friends - and we could talk about things.
All right, is is that what you want, then? You wanna go back to just friends? I don't know.
Anyway, uh, Serena might be a little upset.
Well, you were right.
She can stay in Charles' room.
It's getting crowded around here.
No kidding.
Throw in your ex-husband, and now we're a Nancy Meyers movie.
I hope you don't mind.
I know it's awkward.
Well, I mean, it is a little unusual, don't you think, for a doctor to move in to his patient's building? Well, not if he's the father of the patient's children.
What are you getting at? Is it possible that Will's also trying to get close to you? Absolutely not.
I'm the one that told William to stay away if he couldn't make good on the promises he made to the children.
And I'm sorry if this is uncomfortable for you.
But if William wants to move in to be closer to the kids, I'm not gonna stand in his way.
Mmm.
Holland? Hi, it's Rufus.
Um I have a favor to ask.
And the social scene at N.
Y.
U.
was criminal.
Ten freshmen, a keg and a tub of hummus on a card table isn't a party.
It's a tragedy.
Hmm.
Blair Waldorf just got a text.
It's like watching Lady Gaga set fire to a piano! Who's it from? Serena.
Apparently, Jenny Humphrey is claiming squatter's rights - on her old room.
It's disgusting.
Oh, my God.
Jenny can't do that to Serena Van Der Woodsen.
So what's the plan of attack? It's between Serena and Jenny.
Anyway, I've had some recent bad luck getting involved in real estate disputes.
So I was thinking Warren-Tricomi mani/pedis? I told you.
It doesn't matter if she transfers.
Blair Waldorf was over the minute she became a student at N.
Y.
U.
Are you third personing me? I third person people, not you! Exactly.
You're Blair Waldorf fashion icon, queen B.
And probably the future president of the United States.
Or Chanel.
Jenny Humphrey just kicked Serena Van Der Woodsen out of her room, and you're not gonna do anything? I would.
I just don't have any dirt on Jenny right now.
Ahem.
I do.
Jenny and her boyfriend sold my boyfriend Adderall a couple of months ago.
Lose the judge-face, Zoe.
He took a very heavy course load this semester.
Jenny Humphrey, drug dealer.
I can work with that.
We hear Blair Waldorf's headed for a comeback.
But if she wants to keep her fans happy - Send.
She better keep serving up the hits.
Sleep well? - Don't even, Serena.
I can't believe you posted on "Gossip Girl" - that I'm a drug dealer.
I didn't post anything.
Fine.
Maybe you didn't send the actual e-mail, - but everyone knows you have Blair do your dirty work.
I can't help what Blair does.
And you are the one who played Pablo Escobar - to underage preppy pill poppers.
My dad and I were finally in a good place after a really, really bad patch.
And if he finds this out, it'll destroy everything.
Well, maybe Rufus should know that his daughter is dealing drugs.
After all, you thought my father should know all my adventures at boarding school.
Fine.
Maybe I shouldn't have said anything, but maybe you shouldn't be lying to your dad.
Are you really lecturing me about lying to a parent? - My dad knows who I am, but you're building a relationship with yours that's a complete lie.
I can't believe that you are willing to destroy my relationship with my father because you're too scared that yours won't love you for who you really are.
You were right.
We need to make these decisions together.
But the truth is, consulting with someone else - doesn't come easily to me.
I get it.
Vanessa, I totally support you going.
Thank you, but I'm not taking the internship.
I'd rather lose the job than lose you.
You're not gonna lose me if you go to Haiti.
We're we're we're gonna find a way to make this work.
All right? But you gotta go.
I don't want to, and we both know it's better for our relationship if I stayed.
I mean, three months is too long, and I just wanna be with you.
Are you sure? You're you're making this decision for you? Not me? Not not not even us? Uh okay.
Let's find a way to celebrate tonight, then a fun way.
We could, uh let's see.
You want to sneak 40s into the midnight showing of "The lost weekend" - at film forum? Yeah.
Actually, I'm supposed to have drinks with the woman from CNN, and I owe it to her - to tell her my decision face to face.
Okay.
All right.
Well, uh, tomorrow night, then.
Absolutely.
Blair.
Hey.
You never made it to my lacrosse game yesterday.
What are you doing? I could ask you the same question.
Does Serena know you're trying to pull off plaid? - Seriously, Blair, I expected Chuck to go back to his old habits after your breakup, - but I'd actually thought you'd grown up a little.
Whatever do you mean? Blair Waldorf on the upper West Side two days in a row? It pretty much looks like you're pretending to be a Columbia student, and not that I care much about what Jenny Humphrey does these days, - but I saw that smackdown on "Gossip Girl.
" - She was dealing drugs.
It's called an intervention.
It's called you going back to plotting and conniving, okay, and that's the Waldorf equivalent of Chuck going around, sleeping with every call girl in the city and avoiding any kind of emotional contact.
Okay.
So I'm pretending to be a student here.
But it's only because I'm living a nightmare.
I'm trapped at N.
Y.
U.
, and and it's too late to transfer.
So what's wrong with cheering myself up with a little denial and a "Gossip Girl" blast or two? Nothing, I guess, but you can always make it right with whoever you take down online.
And who knows if Chuck's even gonna have time to do that with Lily or not? Morning, sunshine.
I've got the Dom '95, your favorite.
No, thank you.
And I much prefer Roederer nowadays.
Oh, I apologize.
Nadine left behind some of her intimates.
She must have wanted an excuse to come back.
Or maybe she just left in a hurry.
If you're here to mock me, I'm not in the mood Unless you have some punishment in mind.
We've broken up, Chuck, and frankly, I don't care what you do.
But I can't sit by and just watch you avoid Lily.
I'm actually quite busy with work.
Well, you had time for Nadine.
Trust me, she was work.
And I promise you, Lily is not sitting around, wondering when she's going to hear from Chuck Bass.
Justify not seeing Lily all you want.
You and I both know what this is.
You've lost Bart, Elizabeth betrayed you, and the thought of losing Lily terrifies you.
Please.
Spare me your N.
Y.
U.
freshman psych analysis.
Perhaps if you were at an Ivy, you'd have better insight.
Spotted B.
Claiming to be a co-ed at Columbia, when everyone knows she's a zero at N.
Y.
U.
Poor B.
First she lost Chuck and now her dignity.
"Gossip Girl" blast? - No, it's nothing.
Look, Chuck, sleep with every Nadine in town for all I care, but don't close your heart to Lily.
You and I both know that in the end, the person you'll end up hurting the most is you.
Amalia, it's Blair.
Are you still waiting on me to sign the lease? Well, tell the girls it's a yes.
I'll take the apartment.
You make your bed, you lie in it, B.
Too bad yours is in the east village.
Hey.
Were you able to convince your brother to come tonight? - No.
And please don't act like you care.
I'm sorry? - I just got off the phone with my dad.
Apparently, someone didn't want him living in the building, so they gave him a bad recommendation, and it worked.
The board didn't approve him.
You're behind this, right? I am.
How could you do that? - I don't expect you to understand, Serena, but I felt like it was the right thing to do.
Look, I know you and my father used to hate each other, but that was a long time ago.
You are the only one - still having this fight.
He has moved on.
Is everything okay? Rufus went to the board and blocked dad from getting the apartment.
Serena, that's absurd.
Rufus would never do something like that.
I would, to protect my marriage.
I don't trust William's intention, and I don't want him living under my roof.
Rufus, you're being completely paranoid.
At first he tried he tried to isolate you from your family, and now he's moving into the building to get closer to you.
I told you, he's moving in to be close to the children.
All I see here is jealousy run amok.
Mom, come on.
We should go.
Lil Rufus, it's probably best if you don't come tonight.
What are you two doing here? - This is an alumni event.
Columbia puts aside a bunch of tickets for students.
We'd invite you to join, but they were very explicit no fake students allowed.
Hey, doctor.
If you'll excuse me a moment, I should go say hello to a few old colleagues.
I'll be right back.
Don't rush.
Do I want to know what you had to promise him - to get him to come? - No, it wasn't me.
It's not like he even listens to me, and he probably just ran out of girls to have s*x with.
I, uh, want to apologize.
My absence has been inexcusable.
Well, I know my situation brings up a lot of issues for you.
You've had to deal with so much loss.
But I'm not gonna lose you.
I'm here for you, every step of the way.
You, uh, you look good, Lily.
In fact, you look better than good.
You look great.
Thank you.
I feel great.
So you had better be prepared for a lifetime of family brunches, because I'm not going anywhere.
Okay.
Oh.
Hey.
I bailed on the Columbia gala.
I was kind of in the mood for watching a pretentious movie I don't understand - with you and Vanessa.
No Vanessa, but pretentious movie? Check.
Look, not that I'm not thrilled to expose you to the joys of Russian cinema, but does this visit of yours have anything to do with the "Gossip Girl" blast? Is it true? Are you dealing? I was, when I was dating Damien, yeah.
But, no, not anymore.
This could so easily get back to dad.
I I think it'd be better if he heard it from you.
Are you insane? I I mean, you and I both know that's a suicide mission.
Look If you want him to have faith in you, Jenny, maybe you need to have a little faith in him.
Yeah, all right.
I'll go see if I can dig out a dress from my old closet.
Maybe I can catch him at the gala you know, big crowd, lots of witnesses.
Oh.
Uh, is everything okay with you and Vanessa? Yeah.
Yeah, well, at least I think it is.
It's been hard to say lately.
Maybe you need to have a little faith, too.
It's great to see you again.
You, too.
What a pleasure.
Good to see you.
Good to see you, Bob.
Dad, um, do you have a second? I want to talk to you about something.
Sure.
Please sit.
You know, the contest that I won at boarding school It was for drinking absinthe, and that was probably one of my my tamer nights.
The truth is I I've had a pretty wild past, and I've been a part of more than one scandal.
Serena, I don't care about any of that.
I know.
I guess I was just Scared that once mom gets better, you you may not wanna stick around if you knew the real me.
Honey, I want nothing more than to be a part of all of your lives again.
I'm trying to figure out how big a role I can play without stepping on anybody's toes.
Yeah.
You know, I love Rufus but you're my dad.
He's not.
Aw, Serena finally has the perfect relationship with her daddy.
But will her dream come true be Rufus' worst nightmare? Oh, of course.
The theme of this evening seems to be torture.
You're not a fan of, uh, university galas? Quite the opposite.
I'm in my natural habitat.
It's torture because it's at Columbia.
And by some cruel twist of fate, I go to N.
Y.
U.
It's like being locked out of Lanvin on the day they get fall in.
Sorry, I don't mean to ramble on.
I'm Blair Waldorf.
Wait.
I know that name.
You read "Gossip Girl"? - No, I read college applications.
I work in the admissions office at Columbia.
I was just looking at your application today.
I'm sorry? Look, it's, um, it's not our policy to do this, but e-mails go out tomorrow, and you're standing right here, so welcome to Columbia, Blair Waldorf.
Champagne, please.
Whoa.
Are you okay? You got crazy eyes.
I think I just became a Columbia student for real.
It doesn't make any sense.
I I never applied.
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe he actually did it.
Months ago, Chuck joked about applying for you.
He said you had too much pride to admit N.
Y.
U.
was a mistake.
Looks like he actually did something right for once.
Congratulations.
Oh, thanks.
You're not at the gala? Yeah.
I thought it'd be best for everybody if I didn't go.
I see my father is still working his magic.
It's not all him.
Yes, it is.
It's just that no one else sees it.
You make my mom happier than all of her ex-husbands combined.
It should be you with her tonight, not some guy who pulled a disappearing act.
Well, I am already in the tux.
Elliot, what are you doing here? Your father invited me? He said he didn't think you had plans tonight.
Not me.
I hope that's okay.
It's okay to be mad at him, Eric, but it's okay to let him try to make it right, too.
All right.
I'm heading out.
Wish me luck.
You don't need it.
You're the only one for her.
After Dr.
Van Der Woodsen organized the response to the polio outbreak in India, he moved on to Somalia, where he served as a field coordinator in Huddur.
While there, he oversaw everything from shrapnel wounds to cancer to chronic illness.
Rufus.
I'm surprised to see you here, of all places.
Holland, if you'll excuse me.
I'll catch up with you later.
I need to talk to Lily.
Rufus, what are you doing here? I'm sorry about today.
I don't want will to come between us.
I don't give a damn who lives where.
I just want to be with you.
Improving access to primary health care to remote villages.
He has done all of this while continuing to build his reputation as a leader in the progressive treatments of cancer.
Lily looks amazing, doesn't she? I mean, being sick hasn't slowed her down at all.
Yeah, she is the picture of health.
Invaluable member of our team.
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr.
William Van Der Woodsen.
Thank you.
Thank you, Dean.
Thank you.
I had another speech prepared for you this evening, but then my beautiful daughter Serena came to me, and she was so honest and brave, that it made me realize that, uh, I need to be honest, too.
I made many personal sacrifices to be a doctor, but I never quite realized until now that The greatest sacrifice of all was my family.
So the most important thing that I can say here tonight is not to all of you, but, uh, to them.
I made the biggest mistake of my life walking out on you, and I promise to do everything in my power to make it up to you, to make it right again, because I love you.
My, oh, my.
Did Dr.
Van Der Woodsen just make a public pass at Rufus' wife? Looks like this doctor without borders needs a few boundaries.
Well, I guess you were right about William, but it doesn't matter how he feels about me, because I don't love him.
I love you, Rufus.
I know you're comfortable with him, Lil, but I'm not.
I need you to find another doctor.
Look, I understand why you don't trust him, but surely, you trust me.
Look, I don't want to fight with you, Rufus.
Okay, we'll put it aside till tomorrow.
Let's get you home.
You know what? Right now, more than anything, I just need a quiet night, alone.
Lily.
Please, just for tonight, I need you to sleep at the loft.
Lily.
Jenny Humphrey.
Uh, yeah? You bitch.
You told me you were selling me oxy, but those pills were antibiotics.
Yeah, I didn't get high.
I got a yeast infection.
Dad.
Look, I can explain.
I came here to tell you.
Jenny, please save your breath.
Like I'm gonna believe a word out of your mouth.
Get your things and come with me.
We're going home to Brooklyn.
What did you want to talk about that couldn't wait? The producer from CNN just flew into town, - and I'm gonna meet her for drinks in 20 minutes.
I want you to take the internship.
Come on, Dan.
I don't want us to be making decisions based on fear.
All right? So whatever happens, we'll figure it out.
Thank you.
I, uh Got you some stationery so we can write some handwritten letters to each other - while you're away.
That is so romantic.
Maybe if we become famous writers one day, they'll publish 'em after we die, - like Sartre and De Beauvoir.
Maybe, but don't let that stop you from writing some of the dirty stuff.
Just a little bit.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Not, uh, not if you don't go.
You're gonna be late.
You don't want to be late to meet your new boss.
Get out of here.
Thank you.
Oh, hey, Holland.
Hey.
Have you seen your mother? - No.
I think she left.
Oh.
Is everything okay? If Dr.
Van Der Woodsen loves your mother as much as he said he did in that speech, then maybe there's something she should know about Rufus.
Listen carefully, S.
Holland has a tale to tell.
Apparently, her upstairs neighbor has been coming downstairs.
Good night.
Good night.
Take care.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Bye.
Dad! - Serena, I thought you left.
Um Is everything okay? Not really, no.
I heard what you said in your speech, and if you want to fight for mom, then you should do it.
Ahem.
Hi.
I think you girls got some misinformation.
I will be attending Columbia in the fall.
Oh.
Well, that's awesome.
We have an extra room in the apartment.
Maybe you wanna move in with us? - No.
I don't live with the help.
Oh, and you wanted to see a Blair Waldorf takedown? Well, cross me again, and you'll experience one firsthand.
Hello? - Hey, it's Jenny.
I want to talk to you about Lily.
Obviously, I'm not a doctor, and it's kind of a long story how I know this, but there's something weird about her medicine.
Elliot's the perfect mix of smart and fun.
He speaks three languages, but he has a subscription to "People" magazine.
Hey.
I invited dad over for some hot chocolate.
I I hope that's okay.
If it's a bad idea, I can No, it's okay.
William, join us.
Hey, Rufus.
It's Serena.
Hi.
Is your mom there? Um Yeah, she she's here.
She's just really tired right now.
I'll let her know you called.
They say that family are the people who will always take you in.
But what if instead, they shut the door? I was just telling mom about my date with Elliot.
We had a great time.
Thank you.
Oh, who was that? - Oh, it was just Blair.
Or even worse, let someone else take your place? What do you say, Serena? Who's your daddy? X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
gossip girl here-your one and only source Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
I made the biggest mistake of my life walking out on you.
I promise to make it up to you, because I love you.
You told me you were selling me oxy, But those pills were antibiotics.
Dad.
Look, I can explain.
Get your things and come with me.
We're going home, to brooklyn.
If dr.
Van der woodsen loves your mother As much as he said he did, then maybe there's something She should know about rufus.
I want to talk to you about lily.
Obviously, I'm not a doctor, but there's something weird About her medicine.
Name's cameron.
Blair.
Do you want to make that guy who showed up jealous or what? I'm game if you are.
I'm game.
New day, new designer.
Whether it's love or war you're outfitting for, Thank god for friends and fashion.
That one looks good.
Chuck and I played "wuthering heights" in it.
I mean, who starts a courtship during the day anyway? Humans who venture out in light and aren't named "bass.
" Serena, I have to tell you something.
What's wrong? I've never been on a date.
What about chuck? And nate? And chuck.
And then nate again.
No, I mean on a real date, With someone I didn't know already or who wasn't A british lord masquerading as a college student.
B.
, obviously, cameron liked you When he met you at the loft party.
Just be yourself and have fun.
And try the marc jacobs.
I have to go.
What's going on? You haven't lusted after a louboutin all morning.
I just have to get home.
Is it lily? I think rufus cheated on her.
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know they even had groupies that old.
They met at the rooftop garden committee.
Well, how is your mom taking it? She doesn't know.
I told my dad, And he thought it would be best if we waited to tell her.
Stress isn't good for her condition.
Well, is there anything I can do? Dorota's family has polish mob connections.
No.
thank you, though.
I'm just hoping rufus will stay away until she gets stronger.
And, b.
, I don't know If handcuffs are a good idea for a first date.
 hey, mr.
Workabee   I see you working  It's a good thing you're not a drug dealer anymore.
That girl you sold lily's fake oxy to Wanted double what she paid just to give me the bottle back.
so what'd you find out? My personal pharmacist is looking into it.
Do you trust him to know If they're bad for lily? He appreciates a fine pharmaceutical.
And why are you whispering? If it's a seduction technique, don't bother.
Ew.
You wish.
No, I-I'm-I'm grounded again.
Shocker, I know.
But I'm-I'm not supposed to use the phone.
Fine.
Well, I'll let you know When I hear something about the antibiotics.
Okay.
Cool.
 you give someone something? Hmm.
Only hours and hours of enjoyment.
Thank you for that visual.
Look, I'm gonna go see serena.
Does this mean she's finally out from under her father's spell? No, serena's in a good place.
I mean, after palm beach, She stopped running away or keeping secrets.
I'm glad.
Oh, um, say hello to blair for me.
I hope she has a great day.
Okay, do not do anything to mess with her date, please.
Her date? With whom? you serious? You have all your spies, and you had to get it out of me? Come on.
You finally stopped defiling the pool table With the entire cast of cirque du soleil.
You got blair into columbia.
Why not let things end on a good note? Look, I need to take this.
And don't worry.
I have more important concerns than blair's social life.
Hey.
So what can you tell me about the pills? We went over this.
The only exception is schoolwork.
Chuck bass is not giving you your homework assignments.
What? Dad, you can't take it.
I didn't even do anything wrong.
Well, it's nice to know I can spend my last night with vanessa And come home to my family, fighting like They still live here.
Don't know if you've heard, but your sister's a drug dealer.
Was.
Past tense.
And you already grounded me for it.
Wait.
Grounded to the loft? Lily said she needed some time, so it was easier To bring jenny here.
And jenny would much rather be here anyway.
And jenny's dad thinks it's time for her to stop arguing And go do her homework.
And talking about yourselves like you're not here Is helping how? You know, I can't do my homework without my books.
I'll go to lily's and bring them back for you.
Come with me? Sure.
Yeah, because dan loves being in the middle of these things.
Special delivery.
You know, I'm getting awfully spoiled having a doctor in the house.
Although I am looking forward Rward To drinking my apple juice straight.
I'm surprised you can even stand the smell of that stuff After being pregnant with serena.
You're right.
I did drink an awful lot of it during those months, didn't I? And not just apple juice, That green apple juice from that place down in the village.
What was it called again? I used to make you go all the way downtown To get it for me.
You didn't make me.
I'd go down there right now If the juice craze wasn't over.
About that speech- D- don't-don't even say it.
I'm sorry.
I just got caught up in the moment, And it came out all wrong.
I was hoping that's what had happened.
And I'm-I'm just so thrilled to get to know the kids.
You've just done such an amazing job, lily.
Really.
You know, you-you and rufus.
Thank you.
I honestly don't know How we'd be getting through all of this without you.
Oh, which reminds me- Those homeopathic remedies are clogging up my humidifier.
Want to check it out? Yeah.
Hello? You didn't answer your cell.
You mean my dad didn't.
He took it.
Lily's pills are ivermectin.
They're great at battling parasites And african river blindness, But lymphoma, not so much.
Well, is it dangerous? I mean, does she know what she's taking? What we need to find out is who prescribed them and when.
I wish I didn't rip the label off the bottle.
I don't remember what it said.
The date and the drug store were still legible, Which was enough to track down the prescribing doctor.
Luckily, pharmacists don't make enough to turn down bribes.
Okay, so what's next? The mission requires an expert, Someone highly trained In the art of extorting information.
You're not seriously Gonna use this to try to get back with blair.
My priority is the truth.
If she's the one who can expose it Then you'll take advantage of that To make sure she doesn't move on.
All right, I get it.
Let's just hope she's willing to make herself available.
Meet me at the waldorfs'.
But wait.
I'm grounded.
hey, lil? Rufus, I didn't know you were coming over.
Yeah, we're just picking up jenny's schoolbooks.
They're in her old room.
I thought my mom told you she needed some time.
I just want to check in and make sure we're still on For that friends of the library thing tonight.
I'm sorry, but if she wanted to talk to you, Then she would call you back.
You should leave.
Serena, does she have a problem seeing me or is it you? Holland told me what happened.
About the sublet? I told you already.
I didn't want your dad living in the same building.
You know it's not about that.
Rufus.
What's going on? I honestly don't know.
Um, serena, what did holland tell you? Why don't you just leave? You know what? Why don't we call holland and have her tell us herself? I don't know what you want me to say.
Well, serena's under the impression That you know something about something I did.
I shouldn't be here.
Come on.
I have nothing to hide from my family.
Just tell them the truth.
Rufus and I slept together.
Talk about love thy neighbor.
what? I'm sorry.
Next time, rufus, choose one who knows how to keep a secret.
This is absurd.
Mom, I'm sorry.
I didn't want you to find out like this.
serena, this is not your fault.
lily, why don't you head upstairs, Let me handle this? Thank you, william.
I'm gonna take you up on that.
Lily.
Rufus.
Dad.
I'm sorry.
I never meant to hurt anyone.
Come on, eric.
We don't need to hear this.
Rufus, you can't expect me to stand here And lie to their faces.
You just did.
You asked me to come up here.
You had to know it was going to happen.
Excuse me.
Holland, right? This kind of stress is not good for lily.
Please tell her I'm sorry, again.
There's nothing to be sorry about.
Nothing happened.
I think you should leave, too, rufus.
You'd love that, wouldn't you? The only place I'm going is to see my wife.
What'd I miss? Lil, I'm sorry.
I had no idea she was an insane person.
Look, I don't want to discuss this with you.
Wait.
You actually believe her? What does she have to gain, Standing here, humiliating herself in front of our family? I don't know what the hell's going on.
I just know she's lying.
Yeah, well, it'd be a lot easier to believe If you hadn't left your scarf in her apartment.
We went over this.
I told you, nothing happened that night.
Rufus, you, of all people, Could understand why I might have a doubt.
You didn't talk to me for weeks after you found That letter from william.
Lily, maybe you would do that, but I wouldn't, and I didn't.
When you're ready to hear that and talk about it, Give me a call.
So Crazy day at the van der woodsens', huh? I just wanted to keep rufus away until my mom got stronger.
well, you don't really think he did this, do you? Why would holland lie about it? I don't know.
I don't even know who she is.
But I do know rufus.
I mean, he took me in When my dad left us with nothing.
He's a good guy.
They all are, until they aren't anymore.
I'm just trying to protect my mom.
I get it, okay? But just give him a chance.
He gave you one when you bailed on brown.
Are you really taking his side right now? I'm not taking sides.
We're just talking about it.
Well, maybe that's not such a good idea.
I have to go be with my family.
I still don't see why we need blair for this.
I mean, don't you read "gossip girl"? Extortion's what I do all day.
This is more than headbands and high school.
The two of you here together? Please tell me There's an explanation that doesn't involve the apocalypse.
We come in peace and with a purpose.
Something's going on with lily's medication.
We need your mind game mastery to find out what.
Who are you, house? I'm sure dr.
Van der woodsen knows what he's doing.
It's not van der woodsen.
It's a psychiatrist.
I have an address.
It's weird, right? Lily so does not seem like she's in therapy.
And you so should be.
But as much as I admire the attempt to lure me back With subversive sleuthing, And appreciative as I am of your help with columbia, The answer's no.
Blair, I need to find out Why someone doesn't want lily getting better.
A heartfelt plea as well.
And much more effective than a fatwa.
But you obviously already know that I have a date today.
And nothing you can dangle will make me miss it.
Next time, don't bring jenny humphrey.
I'm sorry you had to find out about rufus like that.
I know you two have become close.
You know I'm only concerned with how you're doing.
I'm not sure.
Is that too honest? No.
No, it makes sense.
Well, you know, after five marriages, The last thing I want to do is Put you and serena through another divorce.
It might sound cold, but they do get easier.
Rufus is different, you know? He's been like a father to you.
And I-I love him.
But if you think he cheated on you, You can't stay with him because of me.
You have to stay with him because you still love him And because you think you guys can work through this.
It doesn't matter who you end up with As long as you're still here.
Well, thanks for coming with me, man.
It means a lot, you getting involved.
Well, hey, my dad would have done this and worse.
All right, and no matter what serena wants to believe, There's no way rufus would hurt lily like that.
Does serena know you're doing this? Well, I was thinking we'd see what we find out Before I tell her.
You're on dangerous ground there.
Yeah, but the only way to clean up this mess, for everyone, Is to find out the truth.
Yeah, well, I-I know.
That's why we need the help of an expert.
Philosophy of war? Hmm.
I'm finally home.
Nate? Humphrey? Please don't tell me my mother rehired you as a cater waiter.
I'm dan.
Cameron.
Hey, nate.
Great game last week.
Thanks.
Sorry to interrupt.
We just need blair's help with something.
Yes, people often drop by with their problems Because they know how supportive I am.
Supportive, I.
E.
Scheming.
Did Chuck send you? His pill plan didn't work, so he sent frick and frack To ruin my date? No, blair, this is about my dad and lily.
This woman holland has accused him of Cheating.
Wait a minute.
An artist or a hippie activist, maybe, But rooftop garden committee? I knew that something wasn't right when serena told me.
No way would another upper east sider shtup rufus.
My stepfather's jewish.
Oh.
Blair, we can't let lily leave rufus.
Will you help us? Exposing scandal on the upper east side? Show me your world, blair waldorf.
They'd be lost without me.
Tell me everything you know about this holland person.
Trust me.
I live with the van der woodsens.
I learned how to lie.
Can I help you? We're here to see dr.
Kemble.
Did you have an appointment? Well, I work for a troubled teen hotline, And I'm really worried that I said some wrong things about Drugs and depression, and was hoping that dr.
Kemble could Actually give me some advice.
Of course.
The doctor will be back next week.
Next week Will be fine.
Thank you.
And what brings you and your mid-level entourage? Nothing personal.
We're looking for holland, who claims she slept with rufus.
Let me guess- Dr.
Holland kemble? You better hope this doctor gets healed Before someone else gets hurt.
So what exactly am I looking for? A bottle of pills, like the one with the oxy- Hopefully, with the label on this time.
Or something else that can directly link them to holland.
Okay, I will rummage and report.
Holland is obviously trying to poison lily so she can Have rufus all to herself.
So shakespearean.
Yeah.
It's also "fatal attraction.
" I just can't handle dead bunnies.
Maybe I'm stating the obvious here, But shouldn't we just tell lily? Tell her what? "jenny tried to sell your mislabeled meds, which somehow Came from the woman who said she slept with your husband"? No, we have to get to holland first.
She's the one who can connect all the dots, And then we go to lily.
Holland will be at the library benefit tonight.
I saw it on the calendar.
Perfect.
Public humiliation always helps When trying to elicit a confession.
We don't expect you to keep up.
It's beyond basic rugby strategy.
So hopefully, jenny will find Something we can use as leverage.
Exactly, humphrey.
Glad to have you aboard this time.
All right.
Rendezvous at my place.
Dress is black-tie.
I'll have tickets.
so You guys do this kind of thing a lot? Oh, yeah.
A lot more than you'd think.
Last year, georgina pretended to be this rich canadian To get poppy, but things got all messed up When she turned her back on jesus.
Yeah, but dan doesn't normally participate.
So that's your sorry-your-husband- Was-cheating-on-you present- a juicer? Trust me.
It'll make your mother smile.
sometimes I wish she would have Let you take us away from here when you wanted to.
Tibet sounds pretty good right now.
Only if you don't get typhoid.
Besides, wherever you run, things still happen.
All you can do is try to learn from them.
Well, as awful as it's been, Maybe mom needed this To see that she wasn't with the right man.
I'm not gonna take advantage of the situation To try to get closer to your mother.
Well, you have been there throughout her entire sickness.
And this whole thing with rufus could have happened So that you could finally stop hiding how you really feel.
I feel happy to be out shopping with my daughter, And to be able to spend some time With the people that I love.
Including mom.
Serena.
Good-bye.
Hey.
Why don't you do something tonight to cheer her up? There's the library benefit.
You could invite her.
Only if you come, too.
What are you doing here? No pills to steal in brooklyn? I actually came by to get a dress If you haven't destroyed them all already.
I have no interest in your wannabe watanabe.
As I'm sure you saw, your stuff is by the front.
And last time I checked, dresses weren't in the kitchen Near my mom's medicine.
Do you even know what your dad's prescribing her? Probably something with high street value Or you wouldn't be interested.
If you could just stop hating me for, like, one second, You'd actually see I was trying to help your family.
Yeah, yeah.
You and your dad have done wonderful things For us van der woodsens.
Like it's been such a banner year for the humphreys? I would give it all back- the clothes, the parties, The limo rides-just for one day that felt normal.
Then why are you still here? You're right.
Nothing would make me happier Than to go back to brooklyn forever.
Was that jenny leaving? Were you two fighting over rufus? I don't want you kids in the middle.
That was just jenny.
You know her- all angst, all the time.
oh, god.
You okay? Do you want me to call dad? No, I'm fine.
I'm fine physically.
Sitting around here is only gonna make you worse.
Dad invited us to the library benefit tonight.
Why don't we go with him? Oh, my god.
A juicer? Don't tell me A night out with your father is exactly what the doctor ordered.
I'm sorry your new beau had to abandon our mission.
Oh, he had a dinner with his rugby team.
How homoerotic.
You know how I love that.
We have plans to continue our date later.
So are you all ready to make the fat lady sing? I'll settle for making the lying doctor lady confess.
Oh, here's nancy drew now.
Did you get our proof? Come on, jenny.
The future of our family is riding on your sleuthing.
I'm sorry.
I looked everywhere, but there was nothing.
All right, what now? If we don't have evidence, She has no reason to tell us anything.
Well, luckily, Like every great general, I have contingency plans.
Archibald, it's time to make use of those family connections.
Watch out, lonely boy.
Seems your little sister has her own ideas About your family's planning.
serena is here.
This complicates things.
We have to avoid them seeing us.
S.
Won't be on board, And we can't have a blonde bombshell blowing up our plan.
And the plan is we wait for nate and dan to arrive With some a.
M.
A.
Guy who's friends with nate's family? The plan is you wait with his ticket.
His name is dr.
Tabb, so pretend you're well-bred and be polite.
It'll pay off if you ever need Orthopedic surgery at mount sinai.
Like when you stab me in the back.
Blair and I will keep our eye on holland.
Once our leverage arrives, she'll either tell us the truth Or we tell dr.
Tabb, and he revokes her license.
I need a phone, too.
My dad took mine.
Don't worry, little.
J.
You'll be back on park avenue in no time.
What are you doing? Playing the part.
Mnh-mnh.
 Hi.
Uh, mount sinai orthopedic? Please let dr.
Tabb know that there's no need to wait.
Uh, nate archibald had a change of plans And won't be coming in tonight.
Thanks.
 You know, I have to say, it's really nice to be here With someone who doesn't hate these sort of things.
I have an idea.
I've already had it.
Dr.
Kemble, I've been dying to get ahold of you.
I've wanted to get him to come to therapy for weeks.
Dad, what are you doing here? Serena called me, but I was already on my way.
I figured if my grounded daughter goes missing, I just have to wait till the next big party To know where to find her.
Dad, I know you have no reason to believe me, But this time I'm actually trying to help you.
Jenny, is holland here? Oh, dad.
What'd you say about holland? Is she here? The a.
M.
A.
Guy wasn't at the hospital, And blair's not picking up her phone.
If holland's here, I need to talk to her.
I've been trying to reach her all day.
not a good idea.
and you don't have a ticket.
Dad, you're not even dressed.
Serena.
 I know a scheme when I see one.
I assume chuck and blair are here somewhere? Okay, yeah, they're looking for holland.
What was I supposed to do? I know rufus did not do this.
And you won't even give him a chance.
Why should I? He wouldn't give my dad a chance.
Oh, so that's it? Anyone who might not like your dad has to go? Nate, all I asked you to do was support me, And instead, you went behind my back.
It's not like that.
look, I get why everyone else did this.
Dan and jenny don't want to believe that their dad cheated, Chuck will do anything to get close to blair, And blair, as much as she wants to, can't run away from a game.
But you were supposed to be on my side.
As if watching audrey hepburn movies Isn't manhood-shriveling enough, I now have to talk about my feelings? Those movies are the only romance I have in my life.
He loves his work more than he loves me.
I'm sorry.
I really prefer to see couples in my office.
Why don't you call and make an appointment? Please.
Please.
He traded me to his uncle For his hotel.
Traded you? For s*x.
Please, is it any worse than you tricking me into kissing a guy Just so you can give a speech? That's not the same.
He's kissed guys before.
She slept with jack My uncle.
Clearly, you both have hurt each other, And now neither of you feel safe.
How can we rebuild? Ahem.
Ahem.
Ahem.
it's going to take a lot of hard work And a lot of time.
Are there any trust games involved? I'm sorry.
I really do have to go.
Did I hear talk of games? Please, just make an appointment.
Just one more thing- that man over there Is on the a.
M.
A.
Disciplinary committee.
Last time I checked, it was illegal To prescribe mislabeled medication, Especially to those who aren't even your patients.
What? You two really are sick.
The person standing with him is waiting for my signal, To show him I have proof of what you did to lily humphrey.
Just tell us why.
Are you in love with rufus? They say psychiatrists are the craziest ones.
Blair? What the hell is going on? Would you like to tell him Or would you like dr.
Disciplinary to do it? I only wrote those prescriptions because I owed someone a favor.
The same someone who told you say you slept with me? The person you really need To talk to is william van der woodsen.
Where's will? What's so important, jenny? Holland's about to tell them everything, If she hasn't already.
Tell who what? Everyone.
The truth about you and holland working together To split up my dad and lily.
Jenny, I'm sorry.
I know that you love your father very much- Which is why I understand why you did it.
And I don't blame you for it either.
It's just- If you're gonna get out of here, you gotta go right now.
Why are you telling me this? So you can get your family back, And I can get mine.
Thanks for your help.
I'll call if I hear about Any cater waiter positions, all right?  Have you seen lily? Uh, she just left with serena and will.
In this family feud, That's van der woodsen, 1, humphrey, 0.
You guys are home early.
Was that boring? Action-packed, actually.
Your father got a call.
He's gotta get back to palm beach.
One of my patients has taken a bad turn.
I've gotta get down there right away.
And we're going with him.
You guys get packed.
I'll arrange for a helicopter to take us to teterboro.
Eric, mom needs us right now.
This is our chance to finally be a family.
I'll, uh, I'll go get my stuff.
Nate already tried calling.
There's no reason to defend your dad.
We're already packing for palm beach.
I just want my mom to be able to put this behind her.
Serena, I'm not calling about my dad.
I'm calling about yours.
Please don't hang up.
Pl-I-I know how happy you are to have him back, But he's the one who got holland to lie about the affair, And he had her prescribe pills for lily, too.
Dan, my dad is a doctor.
Why would he need holland to give her pills? Because the pills aren't helping her illness, And he didn't want them traced back to him.
Okay, what you're saying is just crazy.
Any crazier than your whole family Leaving town with him tonight? I'm gonna go.
Good-bye.
Serena, wait- You all set? My bags are downstairs.
Yeah.
Um, you know, I was thinking Maybe we could just wait and, uh, fly out tomorrow.
I wish we could.
I've got to get to my patient immediately.
Are you sure that's what it's about? People are saying you're behind this holland thing.
Holland? Um, let me go check on mom.
Rufus, what are you doing here? I'd like to talk to your mother.
She doesn't want- rufus, what is it? The truth, finally.
You want to tell her or should I? So serena's father sends her this letter saying that He and lily were together when she came to see him Hoping it would cause problems between lily and my dad, Maybe even split 'em up.
When that failed, he went to plan "b" Getting holland to befriend rufus.
Holland's husband was leaving her, And she was desperate for a friend.
But once again, Rufus and lily proved too solid, so on to plan "c.
" there's a plan "c"? Oh, I always have a plan "c.
" Put yourself in the good doctor's loafers.
Lily comes to him over the summer.
She's actually sick.
He cures her, falls in love, decides to win her back, Only holland tells him lily and rufus are copper-bottom.
He thinks, "what can I do to get her to love me, The family to accept me?" Save her life.
So the pills he gets from holland The ones you stole.
Antibiotics, the side effects of which mimic her symptoms.
He cures her again, gets to be the hero, And they live happily ever after.
No wonder you admire him.
It's almost like something you would do.
Thank you.
It does have the fingerprints of my genius.
The only question now is Will lily believe my dad? Lily, this is absurd.
You cannot believe his lies.
Should I call holland? This time she'll tell the truth.
So you get your mistress to change her story and - hey.
Is my mom really sick? Right now that's all I wanna know.
Of course she was sick.
Uh, to-to even imagine that I would prescribe your mother Medication that she didn't need? It's preposterous.
I've got the files in my bag.
Do you want to see them? You don't have to prove yourself.
Apparently, I do.
Excuse me.
William.
I didn't cheat on you, lil.
I would never cheat on you.
Rufus.
So she's not sick? I just want to be clear.
She's not sick anymore.
He's been lying since he got to new york, to all of us.
Do you think he's even coming back? Yes, of course he is.
You heard what he said.
And I'm-I'm sorry, mom.
I don't want you to be sick.
But dad is not lying to us.
Where's william? He-he's in the lobby downstairs getting his bags.
there's no one in the lobby.
He's down there.
Serena, the lobby's empty.
You-you just must not have seen him.
He wouldn't leave.
Hey.
Hey.
He wouldn't leave me.
Let her go.
oh, god.
we should call the police.
All right, well, let's just give him a minute.
No.
If we wait, he'll be gone for good.
Yes, captain lewis? This is nate archibald.
We met at my grandfather's this summer.
Listen, I need a favor.
What I'd like to know is how did william know to get out of town? Someone must have tipped him off.
It had to be one of us.
It was me.
What happened? It's true.
He left.
I need you to tell me the truth.
When your mother came to me last summer, she was sick.
I cured her.
Then I fell in love with her again.
When I came here and saw you and eric, I- I realized how badly I had messed up.
I never wanted to hurt any of you.
I just wanted my family back.
All you needed to do was be here.
I'm sorry, serena.
I just thought unless your mother needed me You weren't gonna give me a chance.
Well, the police are on their way now, So you should probably go.
Why don't you come with me? I don't forgive you.
I also don't need to punish you.
So if you just go now, I'll make sure they don't come after you.
I love you, serena.
I love you, too, dad.
Go now.
Rufus, I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I was just so overwhelmed.
The only thing that matters is I'm not losing you- To cancer, to will or anything else.
Really? That's it? Dad, she believed you cheated.
She was leaving with her ex-husband.
And you helped make that happen.
You know, you think that william's the only problem? He's not, dad.
You and lily fight all the time.
I mean, one of you thinks the other's cheating.
You both keep secrets.
Jenny, that's between me and lily.
You know, I wish it was, But we all get dragged into it, just like we did today.
When we lived in brooklyn, I might have had To take the subway to school and make my own clothes, But at least our family was happy.
I don't see what's so wrong about wanting my life To go back to normal.
This is where we live.
What needs to get back to normal is you.
If you don't want to be a part of this family, No one is forcing you to stay.
you don't have to wait with me.
Lily is fine, and the sting is over.
You're not really going to keep up this rugby player facade.
It's not a facade.
It's a date, and he's on his way.
I know you felt it.
We were caught up in a scheme, And it was role-play.
It was real.
I know you feel it right now.
It doesn't change anything.
And holland may be crazy, but she was right.
No matter what I feel or don't, we're not safe.
I did the most dangerous thing I could When I said "I love you," And it was worth it.
If I got through my fear for you, You can get through yours for me.
You have until tomorrow to decide.
What? We're never going to be safe.
So are you brave enough or aren't you? I'll be waiting at the top of the empire state building.
You can't "affair to remember" me.
If you're not there tomorrow, At 7:01, I'm closing my heart to you forever.
Well, I won't be there.
How'd the sting go? Oh.
I'd much rather hear about rugby.
Fair enough.
Rugby is a real sport.
Football's for Hello? Hey.
I've been calling you.
There's nothing more to say.
I got to my dad before the cops did.
So I guess now you know Why I don't talk to you about things.
Thanks for coming with me.
I know this was a complicated one for you.
When are things not complicated with serena van der woodsen? You want to talk about it? When the family tree falls, We all need a friend to lead us out of the woods Or into them.
I didn't know you'd be here.
I live here.
I know.
I just thought you'd, um, be with serena or something.
Nope.
But careful- Once darkness descends, true natures emerge, And everything is fair game until morning.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, gossip girl.
Gossip Girl here your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
What's so important Jenny? Holland's about to tell them everything.
The truth about you and Holland working together - to split up my dad and lily.
We should call the police.
If we wait, he'll be gone for good.
I got to my dad before the cops did.
So I guess now you know why I don't talk to you about things.
Thanks for coming with me.
You wanna talk about it? I don't see what's so wrong about wanting my life - to go back to normal.
What needs to get back to normal is you.
I'll be waiting at the top of the empire state building.
At 7:01, I'm closing my heart to you forever.
Well, I won't be there.
You reap what you sow.
What goes around comes around.
No matter how far you run, you can never truly escape.
Everything catches up to you in the end, and when it does, it usually kicks your ass.
Jenny? Rufus, teenage girls are a nightmare.
As soon as they realize that you'll love 'em no matter what they do, you lose all of your power.
You just have to wait till they finish college.
Or in the case of Serena, rebel and not go.
Just talk to her.
Is she in her room? No.
I sent her to the loft to stay with Dan so I could consider the best course of action.
Well, grounding her again probably won't work.
Short of sending her away, I don't know anything else that will.
Well, I think that would be a mistake.
And I would hate to separate her and Eric.
They need each other.
Don't worry about me.
After what I witnessed yesterday, you can do whatever you want with Jenny what are you talking about? She's your sister.
No, not by choice.
She said so herself.
So go ahead and send her crazy ass away.
Although if I were you, I'd do it sooner rather than later, before she hurts anybody else.
Oh.
Finally.
Jenny.
Hey.
You're still here.
Gee, thanks.
As if it wasn't humiliating enough when you fell asleep in the middle of my sentence.
Don't you mean monologue? Seriously, though, thanks thanks for listening to me last night.
Yeah, no problem.
You know I'm here for you, whatever you need.
But I just I don't want you to get the wrong impression.
Don't worry I get it.
You and I are friends.
You love Serena.
Although it looks like love's a bit of a one-way street right now.
Did she call? She's mad, but she'll cool off.
Morning, sunshines.
Hey, uh Jenny's on her way out, actually.
She just crashed the night.
Ah, save it.
I know nothing untoward happened.
That was clear by the sound of you snoring at 2:00 a.
m.
And "New Moon" on the pay-per-view bill.
Although I was hoping to catch you two in the midst of something more than a heart-to-heart.
Okay, I'm gonna go get dressed.
Be careful, Nathaniel.
You and Serena are on thin ice.
All it takes is someone to tap their foot and that cracks.
Oh, what do you know about relationships? A lot in fact, I'm about to save mine.
I suggest you do the same if you can.
I'm sorry.
I I cannot reach table.
Just this once, Dorota.
But if that baby does not arrive soon We're going to have to look into getting you help.
Believe me, I want this baby to come out as much as you do.
Now as soon as that moment comes, your mother and I are heading straight back to Paris.
So are you coming with us? What are your plans? - Nothing, beyond having a second date with Cameron this afternoon and staying as far away as possible from the Empire State Building.
What's the Empire State Building have to do with anything? "An Affair to Temember" was on TCM last night.
It gave me nightmares.
Blair loves the empire state building, even though she doesn't want to, and she should just admit I and make all our life easier.
Miss Blair loves nothing, except for shoes, clothes and anything Harry Winston.
Now, Dorota, would you please gt me some steamed milk? 'Cause this is ice cold.
Actually, no.
I will help you.
Since it appears you have taken an interest in the deadline a certain Bass-hat set for me, I'm calling you into service.
But I already ironed your sheets and alphabetized shoes by designer, like you ask.
What more is there to do? I'm ordering you to chaperone my date with Cameron.
I need to make sure that no matter what happens, I don't go anywhere near that stupid art deco landmark.
Miss Blair, I defriend Mr.
Chuck in Facebook and in life.
But this is pretty romantic thing he's doing.
If not going means never having Chuck in your life again, are you prepared to live like that? Yes.
But even if I'm not, if you let me go anywhere near 34th street, there won't be a miracle but a massacre.
Now put on your walking shoes.
We're going on a date.
Georgina Sparks? Is that you? Da.
Nice hotel, by the way for the Upper West Side.
I hope you're not here to hurt me.
"Operation ditch the bitch in Belarus" was Blair's idea.
I don't want revenge.
I need help.
I'm scared.
Even if I believed you, I wouldn't care.
This isn't like the other times, Chuck.
The Russians don't mess around.
It's really cold there, and there's, like, barely any designer jeans, and the average citizen drinks about 3 pints of pure alcohol a year.
Unless a one-way ticket on the "Siberian Express" is what you're looking for, I'm out.
So if you wouldn't mind, I have some business to attend to.
Maybe I could just wait here until you get back? Or I could see you out now.
It's either me or security.
What time is it? Uh, it's later than either of us wants it to be.
By that, I mean morning.
Oh, my God.
Wow.
That's not usually the reaction I hope for - when waking up next to a woman.
It's not that and you know it.
Oh! - Last night - Don't even finish those words, unless unless they end with " was a mistake.
" I mean, right? Right.
Right.
My thoughts exactly.
I mean, we're we're both in relationships.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was it was totally meaningless.
I mean, we just fell asleep.
Yeah, after an entire bottle of wine and and a whole lot of talking.
And one kiss.
Did that even happen? I'm not sure I'm not sure that happened.
You know, all I remember is is you falling sleep on my arm, and then my not being able to move it.
In fact, I don't even know if I still can.
Like I I was just upset, and you were there for me.
It was just a couple of old friends falling into a comfortable pattern for a minute or ten.
And I love Nate.
I love Vanessa.
W do we have to tell anyone? Not on your life.
No.
I mean, there's no reason to explode our whole world just for some meaningless kiss between old friends.
Whatever this was, it's just between us.
So it's not like we can't keep that safe.
Yeah.
Call me if you need anything.
Okay.
All right.
Bye.
Bye.
That was a mistake.
It was completely random.
It was gravity.
Okay.
Bye.
You were going for the hug.
I I went for the Spotted a family reunion only Faulkner would approve of.
I used to think that S.
and Lonely Boy were the most boring couple on the Upper East Side.
But what makes them actually great together? Is when they're supposed to be with other people.
Actually make that the Empire Hotel, and quick.
Good luck talking your way out of this one, S.
I hope you're on your way to see Nate.
You saw the blast? - Yes, and although I'm inclined to say that Gossip Girl doesn't know what she's talking about, since she also posted some blurry photo of a Russian mail-order bride and said it was Georgina, that really did look like you and Humphrey.
I mean, isn't that a little '08, - like maxi dresses and Miley Cyrus? - Blair.
We all try on old clothes from time to time, and sure, we may even be surprised when they still fit, but that doesn't mean we should wear them again, ever.
Nothing happened and as for the photo, it was obviously the work of Jenny Humphrey.
I knew she hated me, but apparently she hates Dan, too.
I just wish she would hole up in Brooklyn - and leave the rest of us alone.
Brooklyn.
Is that where she is right now? I guess so.
Look, I I gotta go call Dan and make sure he knows what's going on.
Bye.
We have to get off this island.
Cameron, would you mind if we made a little detour? How little? Hey.
So now that our morning - seems to have made t all over Manhattan - Yeah, I saw that.
I just wanna make sure we're still on the same page.
Uh, absolutely.
I don't wanna jeopardize my friendship with Nate or my relationship with Vanessa just as much as you don't want to jeopardize your relationship with Nate or your friendship with Vanessa.
Are you friends with Vanessa? - Friendly enough to not want her to get upset over a meaningless kiss.
I mean, it was meaningless, right? - Dan, is that you? Uh, you know, I gotta go.
Good luck.
Hey, was that my Lincoln Hawk t-shirt Serena was wearing? You saw "Gossip Girl"? I just kinda glanced over Eric's shoulder.
Have you seen Jenny? I need to find her.
I need to talk to her about why she took that picture.
I thought she was with you.
No, she she wasn't there when I woke up and she wasn't there when I went to sleep either, which wasn't until, like, 4:00.
I wish I didn't have to say this, dad, but she's out of control.
I mean, yesterday, it was your marriage, and today it's Nate and Serena, Vanessa and me.
She she's gotta be stopped.
We should go wait for her at the loft.
She's bound to show up there sooner than here.
Hey, have you seen Nate? I have no idea where he is, though I do have a good idea where you've been.
Chuck - Look, before you go and use whatever line you've prepared, think hard.
Nate knows who he loves and what he wants.
So unless you can say the same, look him in the eye and tell him that or stop playing games.
Courage, ma soeur.
Please.
Hey.
Hi.
I mean, I wish I could say I was happy to see you.
Nothing happened with Dan.
We just fell asleep talking.
Oh, really? - Nate, you and I both screwed up.
I only turned to Dan because I was mad at you for calling the cops on my father.
And what your dad did was really wrong, Serena.
That was not for you to decide.
Nate I love you.
I just wanna make things work again.
Nothing happened? Nothing happened.
I just wanna go back to being us.
I know that it'll be hard, but I do wanna try.
Blair.
What are you doing here? Someone has to give you the smackdown you so richly deserve.
That's it me who gets to do it is just the cherry on top.
Bring it on.
I knew when I sent the blast there'd be fallout.
When are you gonna get it? For three years, you've tried to worm your way into our world, but you will never be a part of it no matter what you do.
This isn't copycat dressing at Constance or dumping dairy on you best friend to prove a point.
Nate and Serena? That's mythic.
You don't mess with that and survive.
You're hurting people I love.
You're hurting people you love.
I wasn't trying to Nate loves Serena, Dan loves Vanessa God knows why and Chuck loves me.
But, you, Jenny? No one loves you, except your daddy.
And after what you pulled yesterday, who knows if that's even true anymore? Well I guess you'll find out now.
That's so beautiful.
I can't believe it.
Are you okay? The miracle of life growing inside of you.
I'm in luck! Two smackdowns for the price of none.
What the hell are you doing? - Don't screw up Nate and Serena.
Nothing happened.
So said Serena, but I'm thinking she left a little something out.
All right.
Blair Say life is giving you signs, and you're ignoring them because you're afraid of the thing they're signaling you to do.
But but then but then you think, what if these signs are here for a reason and and ignoring them just makes me a coward -? Signs are for the religious, the superstitious and the lower class.
I don't believe in them and neither should you.
Damn you, Chuck Bass.
Damn you to hell.
Why when did we start talking about Chuck Bass? Spotted atop the Empire State Building, that is a boy billionaire, flowers in hand.
Oh, Chuck.
If you could only see to Brooklyn, you might turn that frown upside down.
Okay, Dorota.
We got a deadline to make.
Uh ooh.
My water break.
Oh, my God.
Holy o okay.
All right, slowly.
Slowly.
Slowly.
Come on.
This way.
A little faster.
Then again, maybe you should guard your heart.
Lennox Hospital right now.
Dorota's water might not be the only thing breaking tonight.
I spoke to your mother this morning, and we decided that you should spend the summer in Hudson and finish high school there next year.
What? I thought you'd be happy.
It's a fresh start somewhere without mean girls and drug dealing boyfriends and "Gossip Girl.
" Dad the City's all I have.
If I leave, I have nothing.
I'm sorry.
That's the way it's gonna be.
It's done.
Dorota! Dorota, did I miss it? Of course not.
Now, you know, you have at your service one of the best Lamaze coaches in the world.
I've been present at the labor of many of my clients.
One of them didn't even know she was pregnant.
Hello, dear.
Hi.
You must go now, Miss Blair.
If if you don't arrive before 7:00, he will be gone forever.
No, I I can't leave you.
I have plenty help.
Please.
You have my blessing.
We both get what we want now.
Go.
Okay.
I'll be back.
W where's she going? - What's that about? - Aah! - Hey, Nate's getting I'm sorry! I can't talk! I have to go! I hope I'm not too late!
Hey.
Hey.
I've been feeling guilty all day.
Yeah, I I know.
I got your text.
Um, I'm not sure right now is the right time to tell Nate.
I mean, there are babies being born and and water is breaking, and I don't even know what we would say to him anyway.
You don't have to say anything.
I think I already know.
Blair.
Stop.
Georgina? Where are you doing here? I followed your mom and Cyrus from your apartment.
I need to talk to you.
I'm in trouble.
Big trouble.
And while it warms my heart hearing that, I'm late.
Good-bye, Georgina.
May God save your soul again.
No, a kiss is not nothing.
People don't just kiss because they're upset.
People kiss because they have feelings for each other.
So do you? Nate, that's ridiculous.
I'm with you, and and he's with Vanessa.
Oh, yeah, what about Vanessa, huh? I mean.
I seriously doubt she's reading "Gossip Girl" in Haiti.
But just in case she is, or even if she's not, maybe you should give her a call, bring her up to speed.
Don't threaten him.
Serena, please.
I can stand up for myself.
Really? Because you're being awfully quiet right now.
Yeah, it's because he knows I'm right.
It's time! The baby is coming! Come on, Dorota! Push! Not enough! Not enough! Oh! Oh! It's a girl! She's beautiful.
Hi.
I'm meeting a young man here probably in a bow tie, possibly carrying peonies.
Nate? Chuck, what are you doing? Trying to forget.
I did the most romantic thing I could think of, and it didn't work.
It was never going to.
I'm sorry.
Well, um, I guess if Nate's not here, I'll go.
Not that I really have anywhere to go.
You can stay here if you want.
It's not like you haven't done it before.
Well, yea, but that was always with Nate, playing video games o watching movies or whatever.
Well, I don't play video games, so if you wanna hang with me, you do what I do.
I'm trying to forget some things, too.
Mostly how happy I thought I'd be once I made it in this world.
The world you're looking for only exists from the outside.
The only reason I survive in it is because I always knew it was empty.
Yeah.
And now I know, too.
I found out the hard way.
The hard way is the only way.
If you want to leave, now would be the time.
I don't want to be alone.
Neither do I.
I didn't expect to find you here staring at babies.
Turns out I'm a big fan of babies.
Everything for them is is so simple.
They start out with a clean slate.
They have no idea how complicated - everything is gonna get for them.
Yeah.
That baby right there he's gonna grow up to be smarter than the rest of 'em, which will make him feel like an outsider, - give him a bit of a chip on his shoulder.
Oh, really? Well, uh, you you see that baby there? She's gonna grow up to have fabulous hair and a great smile, but her daddy issues are gonna make it real hard for her to trust people.
Wanna take a walk? Yeah.
And this baby's gonna do some things to make all the other babies hate her.
Anastasia.
It's a beautiful name.
Can I hold her? I know I know it's soon, but she's so pink and perfect, and, oh Who knew babies could be so astonishing? Miss Eleanor.
Oh.
In fact, uh Yes, Dorota and I were talking Miss Eleanor, Mr.
Cyrus, would you be Ana's godparents? Would we? Paris, Schmaris.
I am never letting go of this precious creature.
Ah! I feel terrible about Nate.
Oh, God, I know.
I know which part, exactly was it the kissing me part or the him finding out part? Or wait, was it the part where he asked us if we had feelings for one another? All of the above.
I need to tell Vanessa.
She she's gotta hear this from me.
You guys really are happy, aren't you? Yeah, we, uh, yeah, we are, definitely.
But I you know, I can't lie.
Knowing someone so well, you think it's gonna be easier.
But in a lo of ways, it just it makes it harder.
Maybe ignorance really is bliss.
Hmm.
Is that why it was so easy with us? You mean because? Yeah.
Sure.
Everything is a discovery this unknown person who can do or think anything.
Well, that was perfectly timed.
Very.
It's Vanessa.
Good news is, she does not get "Gossip Girl" blasts in Haiti, but she does get Nate's texts, and he sent her that photo.
How could he do that? How could he not? Are you okay? You're welcome to stay the night.
You're not kicking me out into the street? Lucky me.
Hey.
Some people don't get the offer.
Nate? Chuck? Chuck! Blair.
What are you doing here? - What are you doing? Is there someone in there? - No, nobody.
Excuse my confusion.
I didn't expect to see you tonight or ever again.
You went.
Sorry I was so late.
I I waited.
Dorota went into labor.
She had her baby.
I wasn't going to show up.
I was resolved not to.
Every bone in my body tried to slow me.
Every voice in my head screamed, "don't!" - But - But I didn't listen.
I followed my heart because I love you.
I can't deny that our path has been complicated, but in the end, love makes everything simple.
Why don't I make you a drink? How about some music? My iPod's in my room.
We don't need music.
I want everything to be perfect.
Jenny.
Go away.
No.
We may get mad at each other sometimes, but if you're really hurting, I'm here for you.
You say that now.
But I'll do something to let you down.
Then you'll turn your back like everybody else.
My dad.
Dan.
Nate.
Serena.
Blair.
Everybody hates me, even even Chuck.
Chuck? What did you do to Chuck? It was such a mistake.
Mistake? Chuck? Jenny, why would you why would you do that? I was sad.
He was sad.
I don't I don't know.
I mean, it's not worse than that time with Damien I didn't do it with Damien.
What? I wanted you to think it.
I didn't, and I wanted to wait.
I I wanted it to be special, and.
.
Don't touch me.
Don't tell anyone? Nate, we need to talk.
I was just gonna say the same thing.
Excuse me.
Hey.
Hey.
Have you seen my dad and Lily? They're supposed to be here with food.
No.
No, I haven't seen them, but, um, Jenny's here.
Uh - She needs help.
You're just now realizing this? You - Dan.
Okay.
What what what happened? You need to ask her.
She's in the chapel.
I don't know, I guess I thought when my dad came back, that I would start making different choices and and stop making the same mistakes.
Well, at least that's honest.
Yeah, I think I need to be alone for a while.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait.
I find it in my heart to forgive you for kissing another guy, and you're gonna break up with me? - It's not breaking up.
It's it's just taking a break.
It's not you - Oh, "it's not you.
It's me.
" Right? Yes, Serena, it is you.
You know, I think it's great that you want to work on yourself, but I'm not gonna wait around to see how things go.
So if you're out, you're out.
That's fair.
Nate, I love you.
I really do.
But if we're ever gonna have a real chance, this is the only way.
Despite the false start earlier, this night is perfect.
Well, there is one thing that wo.
I am so sorry for the pain I've caused you.
And I know I can't take it back, but I wanna try and make it up to you, even if it takes me the rest of my life.
Blair, will you Humphrey! Have you lost your mind? ! What the hell are you doing?! You, tell her.
Tell me what? What's going on? You didn't.
Blair.
You did.
You.
Get out of here now.
And not just out of this hospital, but off this island.
Go and never come back, because if you ever set foot in Manhattan again, I will know and I will destroy you.
Blair, I'm sorry.
You have no reason to be sorry.
This begins and ends with Chuck.
Hey! Who's hungry? I got enough bagel chips to feed an what'd I just walk into? Dad.
Rufus.
Hey, come here.
Come here.
Let's go sit.
Are you okay? Hey, let me walk you home.
Blair, I I thought you didn't love me anymore.
I didn't care if I lived or died.
Jenny Humphrey was just - No, don't say her name! Or anything else to me ever again.
This whole night didn't happen.
Are you sure you wanna do this? Yeah.
It's my idea this time.
Dad! Come here, kiddo.
No tears! - Oh, don't worry.
I'm done crying.
I meant me.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Yeah.
Your mother's thrilled to have you, but you can come home anytime.
You are my daughter, Jenny, and I love you forever and always, come whatever.
I love you, too.
There's nothing here for me anymore, though.
I'm here.
Eric.
Please don't go.
You may be a total bitch sometimes, but you're still my best friend.
What am I gonna do next year at school without you? Who's gonna dump yogurt on my head? I'll Skype you every day.
All right, Dan, Jenny.
Humphrey hug.
Eric and Lily, get in here, too.
Aah! All right, I gotta go.
No, no, no.
A little longer.
A little longer.
But I love you.
Bye, guys.
See you.
I'm actually excited to have an entire summer with nothing to do but figure things out.
Um, first of all, S.
, you didn't go to school this year and you haven't had a real job in months, - so life is kind of like summer for you.
Oh, okay.
Thanks.
Kick a girl when she's down.
I really am gonna change.
Why? All the drama it's who you are, just like I'm someone who's not gonna stop looking for love just because I've lost it which is why I'm going directly into the bell of the beast Paris and why you're coming with me.
Uh, I was gonna do a cleanse and yoga.
And maybe keeping a dream journal.
Haven't you heard of retail therapy? And everyone goes to Paris to write their memoirs not that you'll have the time what with all the riding around on Vespas in cute outfits.
We have never been single together - Or traveled to a foreign land! La premire on Air France has turndown service, and the chef has three Michelin stars.
Come on.
Shopping at Palais Royal, - people watching at Caf de Flore? - Oh, lingerie and Pierre Herms? - Mm-hmm.
Ooh! Thank you! I really think I need this.
Me, too.
It's gonna be okay, B.
As long as we have each other, we're both gonna be okay.
Paris! Aah! Hey, man, thanks for calling.
Um you gonna apologize or you waiting for me? - 'Cause I don't I don't mind going first.
No, I'll go.
Look, I'm sorry for what happened with Vanessa.
I mean, you fired a shot at me.
I fired a shot at you.
But it was a dick move.
And I don't blame you for what happened between me and Serena.
Uh, well, thanks, but I didn't exactly help.
So, uh, I'm sorry for that.
As for Vanessa, I mean, maybe if I told her the truth, that photo wouldn't have hit her so hard.
That bad, huh? What'd she say? Nothing, since she's not currently returning my calls.
But I'm I'm about to write her - the world's longest and most plaintive e-mail.
You trying to get her back? I'm just trying to explain what happened, - to her and and to myself, you know? - Let me know if you wanna take a break from the little soul searching.
When he took off for Prague, Chuck left me his little black book.
Oh, I I didn't realize you and Serena were actually over.
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna spend the entire summer - waiting for her to figure things out.
Right yeah, that, uh, that makes sense.
Listen, I'm gonna have to pass on the little black book thing.
But, uh, you enjoy yourself.
All right, man? - Oh, I'm sure gonna try.
Hey, Dan.
I mean, bonjour! No, you mean, Au revoir.
Good-bye, Humphrey! - We're leaving! - Is that Blair? Where you guys going? - Paris.
Paris? Oh, wow.
Um well, have have fun.
Thank you.
You called me.
What's up? Oh, yeah.
Um, you know, just calling to talk about about things.
Uh, but obviously, now's not a good time.
So just call me when you get back.
Okay.
I'll miss you! I'll miss you, too, Humphrey! Bonnes vacances! - I'll see you in September, okay? - Okay, sounds good.
Okay, bye.
No, it doesn't.
Uh, come in! It's open! Hi, Dan.
Georgina, what are you what are you doing back in town? Looking for you, actually.
I, um, I have something of yours.
What? I don't I don't remember giving you anything.
Well You gave me this.
What?! Congratulations, daddy.
He looks just like you And all in an instant, everything changes.
We leave the past behind and speed toward the unknown our future.
We set out for far-off places and try to find ourselves Or try to lose ourselves exploring pleasures closer to home.
The problems start when we refuse to let change happen and cling to old habits.
Dekuji, ladies.
A velvet revolution indeed.
Hey.
Look, you don't you don't need to get rough.
Okay, I've got lots of money.
I'm Chuck Bass.
Hey.
Hey! Hey! Come on.
Come on not that.
Not that.
Just let me keep the box.
Take me to a bank.
I will give you the money.
Just let me keep the box! But if we hold on to the past too tight, the future may never come.
Till death do us part.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
I Try to tell you That i Love You.
You Loved me? I have feelings for you.
I don't wanna ruin our friendship.
I think we should just throw down and see what happens.
I mean, we just fell asleep.
After an entire bottle of wine And one kiss.
A kiss is not nothing.
People kiss because they have feelings for each other.
blair, you and I are magnetic.
Our pull is as undeniable as ever.
I'll be waiting at the top of the empire state building.
Hi, I'm meeting a young man here, Probably in a bowtie, possibly carrying peonies.
I did the most romantic thing I could think of, And it didn't work.
I'm sorry.
Chuck? What are you doing? Is there someone in there? no, nobody.
Dorota went into labor.
Sorry I was so late.
I can't deny that our path has been complicated, But in the end, love makes everything simple.
I wanted it to be special.
What happened? You need to ask her.
I am so sorry for the pain I've caused you.
Blair, will you be-uhh! Humphrey! You-tell her.
You didn't.
Blair.
You did.
You, go and never come back.
I think I need to be alone for a while.
If you're out, you're out.
Nate, I love you.
I'm someone who's not gonna stop looking for love, Which is why I'm going to paris, and why you're coming with me.
I really think I need this.
Me, too.
It's gonna be okay, b.
Georgina, what are you-what are you doing back in town? Congratulations, daddy.
He looks just like you.
I'm not gonna spend the entire summer Waiting for her to figure things out.
When he took off for prague, chuck left me His little black book.
There's no need to get rough.
Hey! Not that.
Just let me keep the box! nothing beats a summer abroad, But when traveling far from home, it's always nice To bring along an old friend from the neighborhood.
Cobblestones and caf?De flore.
Serena's locked down the left bank And become a muse to us all.
Meanwhile, blair rules the right bank, Storming the shops and consuming the classics And sampling sugary snacks like a modern marie antoinette.
But we hear serena's stories sizzle While blair's are more fizzle.
She shopped at saint laurent And dined at drouant But the only beau b.
Had this summer Is on her headband.
Your cute waiter gave me his number.
Blair, what are you doing? We said we wouldn't check "Gossip girl" All summer.
Summer's almost over.
So what does it say about chuck? I couldn't be less interested.
No new posts.
He's been m.
I.
A.
Since he left town in spring.
And what does it say about us? "Ooh la la! Paris is burning, And serena and blair lit the match.
" Of course, your flame is hotter than mine.
Everyone knows that the only guy Who's been in my pants all summer Is the tailor at pierre balmain.
And whose fault is that? Hey, just as many guys have flirted with you.
I just happen to have a thing for french waiters.
And bartenders and museum docents, Anyone on a vespa or bicycle, Or wearing zadig & voltaire.
B.
, what's wrong? I thought you were having fun.
I am.
The best.
But All summer, I've been sitting in front of my favorite manet And reading colette in the park, Hoping that I'll lock eyes with somebody who's doing The same thing as me and feeling the same things I am.
That's really romantic.
But, alas, not effective.
For all my efforts, I'm heading back home With a chuck-sized cloud over my head.
And I don't Even need to find a great love.
I just wanna go on one nice date.
Well, then this calls for some more sancerre.
Come on.
I know a great wine bar down the street, And it happens to have a very cute bartender.
Jenny looked so good.
You could even tell what color her eyes are.
Well, sending her to hudson was a good decision.
You know what what wasn't? Visiting my mother.
We had to.
Yeah.
Couldn't we have just said the arno flooded And stayed with eric and elliot in Italy a little longer? message one.
lillian, it's eleanor.
Just a reminder that you offered your lovely abode For the fashion's night out planning luncheon tomorrow.
Cyrus, you're going to cut off ana's circulation.
Seriously, dear.
Aren't you glad that's not us? Imagine starting all over again with diapers and bottles and spit up.
next message.
lily, it's bruce caplan.
Call me when you get in.
It's important.
Hmm.
The bass business manager.
I wonder what he wants.
If it's about chuck, I'd rather not know.
end of messages.
No message from dan? Last time we went this long without talking Was when he had his tonsils out.
And I am sick of texting.
Since he hasn't called us, it's time to call in the big guns.
Please, wake me up with a few-few stories From chuck's little black book.
I, uh, I think the last time we spoke, You-you'd made it through all the t's.
Yeah, well, let's just say "V" Is for "Vivid" And leave it at that.
I mean, it's pretty awesome.
I'm having tons of s*x, I never have to eat dinner alone, And best of all, I don't have to talk about anything.
So the key to a good relationship Is no relationship at all? Mm.
It does get pretty exhausting, though.
Hey, don't-don't get me started on exhausted.
Hey, what you're really tired of is Keeping everything a big secret.
No, no, no.
My-my-my dad and lily are home today so I'm- I'm-I'll tell them, I promise.
Tell them what? What decision? It's not mine to make.
Nate broke up with me, And dan was trying to patch things up with vanessa.
Well, I'm not asking you to make predictions about them.
It's about you, what's in your heart.
At night when you're falling asleep, What are you wishing for? When you asked me on this trip, you promised me retail therapy.
I fall asleep Thinking about guys named louboutin and laurent.
Home doesn't exist until we're there.
speaking of home Mademoiselle, pour vous.
Oh.
Merci, delfine.
Judging from its weight and size, I'd say it's your course catalogue from brown.
I'll let you know when I open it.
You know, as much as I'm gonna miss you when you're in providence, Having separate lives ensures no competition, Which means no high school pettiness.
Promise we won't go back to our old ways.
Like you said, that was high school.
so you have no idea where he is? Well, charles didn't exactly leave town on good terms, And even when he does, he finds it best Not to tell us where he's going, for our own sakes.
Yeah, well, I need your help in finding him this time, and fast.
He hasn't paid the mortgage on the empire since may.
That's when he left.
Yeah.
Well, the bank says one more missed payment, He'll be in default.
So these are the last records of his movements.
It's plane tickets, credit card charges, a.
T.
M.
Withdrawals.
Why don't you look 'em over and maybe make a few calls? Of course.
Thank you, bruce.
Thank you.
We'll find him.
okay.
Hey, mom.
hi, sweetheart.
I wanna hear all about your day- The food, the shopping, and the boys on vespas.
well, that pretty much sums it up.
But first, um, I wanted to know if you or blair have heard from charles.
No, and I don't expect to.
It's actually decent of him, leaving her alone.
Yeah, poor blair.
Is she still hurting? Yeah, but she's putting up a good front.
And I wouldn't worry about chuck.
Any normal summer, He's drunk on some island where polygamy's legal.
Given everything that happened, it makes sense he's gone rogue.
Why you so interested? Oh, no, uh, if you don't know anything, I can find out myself.
You just keep having a good time.
How are you? I'm not sure.
I got into columbia.
Serena, that's wonderful.
Yeah.
Yeah, but I'm not sure blair will think so.
Your dad called me.
He said he couldn't reach you.
I told him he should try serena Because I assumed you'd be with her, Because what other reason could there possibly be That you haven't called or e-mailed me all summer, Or making me have this conversation in the doorway.
No, vanessa, I'm so sorry about that, but there is a reason.
Is it Because you've become a hoarder? You know what? A- after what you did, I shouldn't even care.
But Are you okay? I'm I guess you're more than okay.
Is that the reason you've been avoiding everyone? Because you're seeing someone new? No, I'm not.
I'm-I'm not.
dan, is there someone here? You know what? This was a mistake.
I'm gonna go.
That's probably a good idea.
Thanks.
You're dating georgina? No.
No, we're not dating.
That's true.
We barely ever leave the house.
No, but it's not-it's not for the reason you think.
Then what other possible reason could there be In the god-I-don't-believe-in's universe for georgina sparks To be leaving lingerie around your house? Meet milo.
He's our son.
No.
No.
Shut up! No, you-you really- you have to shut up right now.
Shut up! Oh, my god.
Okay, you didn't.
You did? Are you serious? Shut up! God! Oh, my- tiff, do you mind? Oh.
Sorry.
Okay, you didn't.
You did not.
You did?! Wouldn't wanna interrupt your girlfriend's private conversation.
It seemed pretty important.
She's not my girlfriend.
I was being polite.
No, she's not that, either.
She's just a Friend of a friend.
What kind of a friend is that? The kind that leaves me his little black book For the summer.
And I doubt your friend would bring his friend To a place like norma's.
Well, it's the least I can do, To take her to a nice restaurant.
I mean, that perkins hostess Slept with tiger woods for over a year, And all he got her was a chicken wrap.
Oh.
That's respectable.
Thank you.
So why isn't it your companion? Well, I tried respectable.
You were hurt.
No.
Well, I guess there's a First time for everything.
Easy come, easy go.
I can't tell if your approach is enlightened or chauvinistic.
Take her seat and find out.
That's a good line.
You almost pulled it off.
But I have an appointment I can't be late for.
Well, nate archibald.
Could I at least get your number? What, it's not in your friend's little black book? An american who loves manet? It's too good to be true.
How did you know I was american? And don't tell me It's because my accent isn't as good as I think.
Your accent is divine.
But your watch is set to eastern standard time.
New york? Born and bred.
I've never been, But I'd love to hear all about it.
Over dinner tonight? It would be my pleasure.
Great.
Give me your information, and I- I'll pick you up at 9:00.
louis? I'll see you tonight.
Wait, wait.
A car? Embassy? Grimaldi? Don't tell me you're- I'm louis.
Just louis.
Hey, where are you? I wanted to talk to you this morning, but you'd already left.
I think I just met a real live prince.
A grimaldi-as in the royal family of monaco.
As in grace "American princess" Kelly.
Stop whatever you're doing.
We need to shop.
Only for you, b.
Spotted-b.
And s.
, Chic and cheerful Up on boulevard haussmann.
They dallied at department stores And stayed a while at tally weijl.
Down on rue saint-honor? They courted couture at palais royal And found the perfect outfits To ba&sh the competition.
Then they headed to the golden triangle, Where montaigne meets george cinq, And luxury goods are the opiate of choice.
But the grimaldis aren't a very large family.
He's probably a first cousin at least, But just to be sure B.
, what are you doing? Cinderella did not google prince charming.
A mystery man shows up at your painting, Just like you wanted.
You cannot make this about some social agenda.
You're right, and so what If my fairy godmother is my credit card? This is fate.
Wait, before I lose you to another shoe coma, There's something I wanna talk to you about.
That package I got yesterday S.
, I want to hear all about How brown offers a major in raw foods, but It's louis! We're going to baccarat! I have just the thing to wear.
And you have to pick up a little something, too.
His friend jean michel showed up unexpectedly in town, And our date is now a double.
I don't think that's a good idea.
This is your princess moment.
Please? If you don't come, he's gonna cancel.
And those brown boots would look amazing on you.
Brown! What did you want to tell me about college? It can wait.
Let's go buy boots.
Look, I-I'm-I'm working on it.
I just need a little more time.
you have one day.
not again, milo.
Can't you ever sleep for more than five minutes? sorry, I think I have the wrong number.
Oh.
Mr.
Humphrey.
Um, this is georgina sparks.
It's so great to hear from you.
It is? Georgina, I-I don't understand.
W- why are you answering my phone? Where's dan? listen, I'm sorry that we couldn't talk more yesterday.
Milo's been real colicky.
The fact that you even know that word is- Oh, oh, oh, oh, you'd be shocked at what I know About breast-feeding and baby poop and episiotomies.
Wow, do not mention her geor-gina.
It's a lot to take in.
Believe me.
But please-please don't tell my dad or-or lily, all right? I gotta be the one to tell them myself.
Why haven't you? I don't know.
Maybe 'cause I'm totally freaking out? Do you know how difficult it is to keep a baby alive? You can't drop it.
You can't leave it alone.
It has to eat, like, every three hours.
If I don't know what hit me here, How am I supposed to tell my dad? I have to ask, as will rufus- Are you sure milo's yours? Of course he is.
I mean, I'm pre- yeah, I'm pretty sure.
You didn't have a paternity test? Vanessa, you weren't there when she came to me.
Her parents threw her out.
She was-she was scared.
It was actually my idea for her to move in.
I've been waiting for the crazy shoe to drop But it never did.
I mean, she's- she's been great with milo.
Dan, we're talking about georgina sparks.
Her hair lies.
You can't trust one thing that comes out of her mouth, Let alone anywhere else.
I know.
I asked her for a paternity test, But you can't get one in the last trimester.
I didn't sign the birth certificate.
I told her I wouldn't until we got the test.
What are you waiting for? You have outdone yourself once again.
Truly fit for a king.
Well, not a king yet, but maybe someday.
You clean up pretty good, too.
Merci.
Oh.
He's driving himself.
That's Progressive.
Independent.
Louis, bonsoir.
Blair, you look amazing.
And this must be serena.
Uh, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Serena, um, may I introduce Jean michel grimaldi Of monaco? Blair, enchant? I don't understand.
I thought you were a grimaldi.
The chauffeur was taking you to the embassy.
Oh, you misunderstood.
I am a driver for jean michel's family.
I took them to the embassy, where they're staying.
Oh.
I-I see.
So that means your date is a prince, And mine Is charming, handsome, and loves manet.
We make our own fairy tales.
Let's go.
I've never sat up here before.
Oh, wait.
Spotted-b.
Riding shotgun.
Great view.
Let's see if our royal wannabe Has the grace to make it through the night.
Eleanor, you're early.
Well, just to set up, dear, and to accessorize you Properly.
You know "Bass" Is not her middle name.
Well I was afraid nobody would know who she was.
Not a lot of humphreys in the society pages.
Well You don't have to stick around if you don't want.
Oh, you think I'd skip out On a roomful of champagne and models? Are you forgetting I used to be a rock star? Oh, what is this? Why do you have chuck's travel itinerary, Bank statements, and credit card bills? Because I think he might be in trouble.
After what he did? Good.
Well, apparently, he went to prague in may, Checked into his usual suite at the mandarin, And never checked out.
His credit card charges are very un-charles-like- Second-class train tickets, prepaid cell phones.
What if something happened to him? Look, for better or worse, he's a part of this family.
Yours, not ours.
And after the choices he's made, Chuck deserves whatever's coming to him.
Did I hear you say chuck? Blair will not even mention his name.
She never even told me why they broke up.
Uh, you wanna tell her or should I? Aren't you so excited that our girls Will be at columbia together this year? What?! Yeah.
I didn't even know that serena had applied.
Here you go, danielle.
And if the c.
F.
D.
A.
Needs more volunteers, let me know.
I'm around.
Of course.
Juliet, have you met willy wong from nyc & company? Oh.
Nice to meet you, juliet.
Nice to meet you.
Oh.
Here you go.
Thank you.
And drinks are to your left.
Thank you.
and the guards at the casino were charging on us.
$1,000 chips were flying everywhere.
everywhere.
Then a guard grabbed me by my belt And dragged me out to the street.
All because he was wearing blue jeans.
it was crazy.
Oh! Oh, my gosh.
Sure, But enforcing strict standards of dress is essential For maintaining the decorum of an event.
Besides, it's tradition.
Men's formalwear hasn't changed hardly in over a hundred years.
And it's not just a symbol of class.
Owning a tuxedo shows the world that a man has enough means To marry and provide a future for his family.
Blair, are you okay? It's my mother calling from new york.
I should take this.
I'm fine.
So who wants a bite of her dessert? What is it, mother? I can't talk long.
I'm on a date.
Blair, you sound irritated.
Are you okay? Why does everyone keep asking me that? So what if serena always gets the prince and I get the pauper? Being jealous of her is totally constance, and I've moved on.
Well, that's wonderfully mature, dear.
And the best part is that nothing has to change Now that she's going to be at columbia.
What? Serena's going to columbia? Let me know if there's anything else I can do for you, karlie.
Thanks.
Is eleanor here? Uh Oh, right there.
Thanks.
Nate?
Hey Juliet.
What are you doing here? I'm a volunteer.
I worked the event last year.
What are you doing here? Nathaniel, thank you for getting here so fast.
I was hoping you could look at charles' papers And see if there was anything that you might find That I haven't.
But steer clear of rufus, okay? Okay.
Blair, come meet lou doillon.
Bonjour.
Bonjour.
Hey, maybe you could ask lou doillon To be your new best friend, because I'm done.
Have fun on my date.
Excuse me.
Can I get your name? No.
Oh, god.
This is not good.
Georgina.
To what do we owe the pleasure? You have 15 seconds to top me off or you're fired.
Ahem, georgina, maybe you should come with me.
That's sweet, archibald, but I don't like vanilla.
Does dan know you're here? Why would dan know? hello, dan.
Hey, uh, I'm-I'm at home, and you guys aren't here.
What, you go on a walk without me? Yes, we did, all the way across the bridge.
georgina, don't do this.
What? W-why? I just thought it was time everyone met.
Would you like to talk to your dad? Rufus, dan's on the phone.
He'd like to speak with you.
Dad, I am so sorry.
I- I wanted to tell you.
I just-I-I didn't know how.
Tell me what? Whose baby is that? Here you go, grandpa.
oh, god.
This is milo humphrey, your grandson.
Daniel? Dan? Spotted-georgina sparks, a stroller, And dan's dad with a scowl.
I think he's on his way.
Looks like lonely boy has a baby boy.
Meredith, I am so sorry about this.
Please apologize to everyone at "Vogue.
" Um, unfortunately, something has come up.
But eleanor has said she's more than happy To continue the party at her place.
And we've got a little one there as well.
Absolutely adorable thing.
You'll love her.
What's going on? Why does georgina sparks have a baby? We are still trying to figure that out.
I'll keep you posted.
Okay.
Bye.
meredith.
Hello, nathaniel.
I wanna take you to Who could've seen this coming? Have you met georgina? Good point.
Where is she? She Please tell me This is just another one of her ridiculous schemes.
Dad Why don't you, um, talk in serena's room? Sorry all the drama ruined your luncheon today.
That's okay.
Well, in case you're wondering, My life's been pretty drama-free these days.
Uh, hello? pardon the interruption, mr.
Archibald, But there's an emergency in your suite.
What kind of an emergency? Hey, there you are.
What's wrong? You can have the left bank, okay? But I want the right.
Every cleavage-baring blouson and cute bartender is yours.
But I want a dress from dior and I want a date with a royal.
And I wanna go to school And take classes and have friends Without living in your shadow for the next three years.
You heard about columbia.
Do you wanna hold him? Look, I-I wasn't expecting this introduction either.
You didn't have to spring it on us like this.
I know I have a flair for the dramatic.
But I didn't know what else to do.
dan wasn't telling you, and you had to know.
At least now everybody's talking.
Oh, please.
You're enjoying this.
I know you think I'm crazy, that I'm a schemer and a liar And pathologically selfish, and-and that's true.
Or it was, Till milo was born.
I understand if you hate me.
Please don't hate my son.
He deserves to have a good family, And no one has more love than you or rufus.
Hey.
Oh.
Lily, dan hasn't done a paternity test.
It might not be his kid.
Is this true, georgina? You're right, rufus.
Dan did not do the paternity test, But I did.
I wanted you to love milo because you wanted to, Not because you had to.
But If it's come to this, then so be it.
This-this says I'm the father.
Well, no offense if I don't take your word for it.
Blair, I'm sorry.
I know you wanna do your own thing.
But columbia isn't yours.
My dad went to med school there.
He encouraged me to apply.
And I wanna go to college, But I don't wanna leave the city.
I wanna be with my family and my friends.
I - I wanna be with you.
Oh, lucky me! I love how it never has occurred to you That someone might not wanna see you every single day.
"Someone," Sure.
Probably lots of people, but not my best friend.
I need a chance to succeed on my own.
I wanna be myself, where I belong.
Last year, first with n.
Y.
U.
And then chuck - It was the worst year of my life.
Yeah, well, my last year was pretty awful, too.
I- I-I fell for a married man, got in a major car accident.
I fought with my mother so much I was basically homeless.
And then there was my dad Fine.
Stay in the city.
Just go to a different school, okay? Blair, I wanna make you happy.
I really do.
But college is too big of a deal.
I got in and I'm gonna go.
Look, we can talk about all of this tomorrow.
But right now, There are two very handsome frenchmen waiting to take us To the front of the line at le baron.
Louis really likes you.
Yes, he does.
And so does jean michel, for that matter.
I'll go back, by myself, And I'll come up with some story as to why you didn't return- That you tripped and fell in the fountain.
Seriously? No one's gonna believe that.
Wanna bet? Well, thank you, doctor.
I- I appreciate you confirming these results yourself.
Okay.
Bye.
It doesn't mean anything.
We're doing our own test.
Dad, the dates line up.
I-I thought we were being careful, But it's not like I didn't sleep with her.
Why didn't you come to me when she first showed up? Do you remember how you reacted two years ago When serena and I had that scare? Not to mention I didn't know That I could handle the truth myself.
Everything you said then is-is still true.
I had to see this through.
I- I couldn't let georgina go off, Raise this child without me, nev-never knowing him.
I may get angry or protective, But I'll always be there for you.
That's how it works when you're a father.
You may not understand that now, but trust me, one day you will.
I- I think I already do.
Georgina, do you have the birth certificate with you? It's in my bag.
Thank you.
Thanks, dad.
What are you doing? You wanna play "Rock band 3" With us? There's a keyboard.
We can make it a 5-piece.
Oh, I hope it's okay.
We used your credit card.
Your friend who left you his book-what was his name? Chuck bass.
And what would chuck bass do in a situation like this? He wouldn't be in this situation.
And you shouldn't be either.
When you're ready to talk about What really got you into this place Give me a call.
You're a natural.
thanks.
Mm, have, uh, have you talked to serena lately? Well, the better question is, have you? I know something happened between you two before she left.
But I'm guessing you haven't had much time to figure things out.
There's nothing to figure at this point.
I- I can't imagine she'd be interested In being a stepmother.
Yeah, I've-I've sealed my fate, I think.
But, uh, but-but when you do speak to her, if you could Do me a favor and just not say anything about this? I wanna be the one to break this news.
Yeah, of course.
is she having a good time? Well, it's paris.
There's great shopping, great food, I think she's having the time of her life.
I know, jean michel.
We all love serena, But she's just clumsy like that.
It must be all those long limbs.
Serena.
what happened? Blair happened.
I'll see you in new york.
Jean michel, would you care to walk me home? Wait, no, jean michel! Don't! That's okay.
I'm glad to have you all to myself.
Actually I'm tired.
If jean michel is gone, shouldn't we go, too? He told me I was being overcautious, - But I see that I was not.
About what? I am the royal.
Jean michel is my driver.
When you asked me so many questions about my name, My car, the embassy, I grew concerned that you might not like me for me.
What? No.
Who-who would ever- It happens sometimes.
But when I found you gazing at my favorite painting, I thought that someone who loved what I loved could- Could one day love me, too.
We hear baccarat just updated its menu.
I thought it was fate, but I guess not.
No, no, no.
It is fate.
It's just Have a good evening, blair.
The gateau du jour is now humble pie.
Bon appetit, blair.
hello? - Georgina? Hey, it's vanessa.
Dan and the baby are sleeping right now.
Yeah, I just tried his cell.
Do you have a message? I don't really have time to chat right now.
I just wanted to tell him that I am here if he needs to talk.
I'm his friend and always will be.
Oh, that's sweet.
He's gonna need a friend.
I'll let him know.
And just in case you don't, - I said the same thing on his voicemail.
You know me too well, friend.
Good-bye, vanessa.
Is it any consolation That I totally imploded and ruined my date? It's not.
I called the airport.
The car is already on the way.
I can catch the red-eye.
Can you hand me that copy of "Be"? I wanna read it on the plane.
Please don't go.
I don't care about dating a prince.
I don't care about dating anyone.
I just care about you.
I really need my friend right now.
I've been acting like I'm okay, but I'm not.
They say it's a broken heart, but I hurt in my whole body.
I mean, what if I stay like this forever? What if I never get over chuck? You will.
You'll see.
I just don't know what I'd do without you.
I'm scared if you come to columbia That I'll do something to destroy us.
Well, you pushed me in a fountain tonight, And here we are, talking about it like mature young women.
So I'd say that's a good sign.
And what if columbia's a disaster, And we lose each other for good? And what if it's amazing, And we become closer than we've ever been? Come on.
Live dangerously.
you in? Yeah, I'm in.
Now all you have to do is tell dan and nate That you'll be in the city next year.
What are you doing? Spreading the word myself.
And you can't change your mind Because gossip girl hates being wrong.
This just in from miss b.

  Herself
Serena van der woodsen is heading to columbia.
S.
And b.
Together again? We think we've died and gone to heaven.
Or at least the upper west side Nate.
Hey, I know it's late.
But you know what? You were right.
I- I was hurt By someone.
A lot, actually.
I'm sorry.
I didn't think I was gonna have to see her again for a while, And I just found out she's coming back to new york city And I'm just not ready.
You know, I was trying to send a message to her That I'm having the time of my life, and it just isn't true.
I can't keep it up.
I'm exhausted.
I owe the hotel thousands of dollars in damages.
Do you wanna meet up to grab a cup of coffee? Sometimes it's easier to talk to a stranger.
That sounds-sounds great.
Yeah.
French roast, 20 minutes? Absolutely.
It's from France.
Hello? Yes, this is she.
Oh, my god, is it serena? Is she okay? Okay, I will.
What? What is it? A body washed up in paris-shot.
The identification they found says it's charles bass.
Stop! My little sister! - Stop! Get off of me! Did you sleep with her?! - Jenny humphrey was just - Don't say her name! - where am I? - you're safe.
Who are you? What's your name? H- henry.
Henry prince.
You had the dream again.
I hoped it wouldn't follow us from prague.
I guess I'll have to give it more time.
You have as long as you need.
My uncle said the apartment is ours, And he's got you a job, too.
Thank you.
Welcome to paris, henry.
Let's go home.
Napoleon once said That secrets travel fast in paris.
But gossip girl travels faster.
Bisou bisou.
Gossip Girl here.
Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Dad, I am so sorry.
I wanted to tell you.
Tell me what? This is Milo Humphrey, your grandson.
A body washed up in Paris shot.
The identification they found says it's Charles Bass.
What's your name? Henry.
Welcome to Paris, Henry.
Let's go home.
I think I need to be alone for a while.
Oh, so I didn't realize you and Serena were actually over.
I'm not gonna spend the entire summer waiting for her to figure things out.
Could I at least get your number? What, it's not in your friend's little black book? When you're ready to talk about what really got you into this place, give me a call.
You know what? You were right.
I I was hurt.
Do you wanna meet up to grab a cup of coffee? That sounds great, yeah.
I thought that someone who loved what I love could one day love me, too, but I guess not.
No, no, no.
I've been acting like I'm okay, but I'm not.
What if I never get over Chuck? Summer is coming to a close, and as everyone knows, Paris, like the Upper East Side, empties out in August, leaving behind only the tourists and the dreamers, lamenting the imminent return to real life.
I can't believe it's almost time to go back to New York already.
I know, and you still haven't made your Sophie's choice between Brooklyn and the Upper East Side.
What? If you go back with an uncertain heart, there will be drama and disaster for all.
It's like choosing between eclairs and napoleons.
They're both delicious.
Except Humphrey's a doughnut.
Well, I would love to stay and talk patisserie, but I have to get ready for my perfect Parisian date.
Wait, what? You got Louis to give you a second chance? B.
, that's great.
And to prove that I care about more than his title, I've planned a day of polite interaction with the proletariat.
Think Diana, princess of the people.
Obviously, I'll wear gloves.
Obviously.
Well, I'm off to buy gently worn items in the 12th.
And don't worry.
Not even you choosing a Humphrey will ruin my date.
Nothing will.
Mm.
Au revoir.
Hi, mom.
I'm sorry to bother you on your last day, Serena.
I got a very upsetting phone call from the Paris police.
Oh, if it's about Blair pushing me in the fountain, I'm not pressing charges.
They pulled a body out of the river and found Charles' wallet.
Oh, my God.
You don't think it's him, do you? Well, it would be a lot easier not to panic if someone had heard from him or he had been paying the empire bills.
Listen, um, sweetheart, they need a family member to identify the body.
If it's too much for you, I will be on the next flight.
No, no, I'm I'm here.
I can do it.
Thank you.
Listen, let's just keep this between us.
I don't want to worry anyone until we know for sure what's really going on.
Yeah, I agree.
I'm sorry for the Are you kidding? Serena took her best friend's boyfriend's virginity, ran away to boarding school, bounced from guy to guy until dating your married congressman cousin, fell in love with you, and then cheated on you with your friend, who's also her ex? Yep.
The only thing that would make it better is if one of those boyfriends turned out to be her brother.
Well, does stepbrother count? The life of Serena Van Der Woodsen is like the most complicated Jane Austen novel ever.
Aren't you glad you finally reached the last chapter? I haven't even responded yet.
Things between us- they never really ended.
They just stopped, and Instead of dealing with them, I- I just You little-black-booked the pain away? Exactly.
Well, do you wanna get back together with her? I don't know.
You know, it would be nice if I were the one deciding, not her.
In that case, the first thing you need to do is eliminate the competition.
What was his name again? Dan's not the competition, all right.
He's my friend.
Besides, for all I know, he's not even interested in her anymore.
And what happens if it's too late by the time you find out? Look I can help.
Let me be your life coach for the next 24 hours, and I promise you, you will be in a place where you're the one making the choice.
Brooklyn, you say? Why don't we just both go home, shower, get dressed, and I'll meet you there? Sounds good.
Good.
The body was in no condition for fingerprints, but We found this.
That's his.
We're testing the blood on the wallet.
Do you need a moment to gather yourself? No amount of time will ever make this okay.
Five more minutes.
As pleasurable as those your uncle was already generous enough to help the strange American you brought home from Prague.
I don't want to be late for my first day on the job.
One thing I'll miss about taking care of you after the shooting will be spending all day in bed together.
I couldn't have enjoyed being saved more.
I'm just happy to be taking care of you now.
I know a way you could take care of me right now.
I wouldn't be able to tear myself away.
Then what would your uncle think? You're a good man, Henry prince.
Too good.
This loft is your loft this loft is my loft where's your aunt Jenny? She moved to Hudson she wears leggings wow.
I did not need to see or hear that.
No.
Well, I'm- - I'm doing the best I can.
Who's this? This is Juliet sharp.
She's a new friend.
Pleasure to meet you, Dan.
I hope you don't mind me tagging along.
No, no.
Vanessa's supposed to be here already, and Georgina's at the spa, and Milo has not been taking his bottle all morning.
Oh, buddy.
I think he's kind of mad at me.
You all right? Yeah, you wanna hold him, Nate? You don't expect me to sing, do you? No.
Just make sure you prop his neck up.
Oh, he smells funny.
Oh, maybe he just needs a woman's voice.
Okay.
Whatever you were singing was definitely not that.
Hmm? Ask him, like we agreed.
Come here.
Yeah.
You're so cute.
She's definitely not out of Chuck's little black book.
No.
No, she, uh, sure isn't.
So have you heard from Serena lately? Uh, no.
No, I haven't.
I would assume she's still in Paris or at brown already.
Actually, Gossip Girl said she's going to Columbia.
She's she's coming back to the city for school now? That's what the blast said.
You not okay with that? No.
No, I'm fine with it I guess.
I- I'm just surprised she didn't say anything to me about it.
But if she didn't say anything to you Hey, Dan, can you grab a diaper? Yeah.
Yeah, I'll do it.
What is it? Well, he said he hadn't heard from her.
Looks like Dan's playing a game with you.
Now do you want to win, or do you want to lose? I suppose it's worth missing you if it means staying in a place where you don't have nightmares.
And you look very handsome in your work clothes.
Well, I look forward to you removing them after an honest day's work.
Bye.
Bye.
They say it's easy to forget your troubles when the weather's warm.
But all it takes is one fall breeze to blow reality right back in your face.
What are you doing? Suddenly we're stopping for pedestrians? Vite! Watch out, Blair.
He who sows the wind reaps the storm.
Next time, I promise we'll do shoes and vintage, and not just health food stores.
Aw.
Let me see that beautiful boy.
Well, you guys seem to have bonded.
We had a nice talk.
Hey.
Aw, Vanessa, you're amazing with him.
Yeah, she's a serious baby whisperer.
Living on a commune, you clock a lot of babysitting hours.
Right? Okay, I get what you're doing, and it's not exactly subtle.
The goal is to take him out of the equation.
Not by using Vanessa.
She's still totally in love with him.
She's just hurt by what happened last spring, and she's looking for a sign to see how he really feels about her.
She told you that? She didn't have to.
I'm not trying to ruin people's lives.
Vanessa and Dan are great people.
And from what I hear, they made a great couple, too.
Yeah.
Okay, I will.
I love you, too.
Bye.
"I love you, Nate" or "I love you, Dan"? "I love you, mom.
" Oh.
Well, it's all right.
Now that I'm an egalitarian, I'll accept it even if you choose Dan, and not just because he's ahead in the "Gossip Girl" poll.
Gossip Girl has a poll? Honestly, I haven't even thought about it.
B.
, I went to the morgue today.
What is that? A s*x club? A place where they keep dead bodies.
I had to identify one because he had Chuck's I.
D.
Don't worry.
It wasn't him.
I'm not worried.
But, Blair, I just hung up with my mom, and Chuck is missing.
Well, consider him found.
He was on the Rue de Charenton an hour ago.
What, you saw him? Here? Gossip Girl said I was in Paris.
Where else would he be? My mom and the police are looking everywhere.
He hasn't paid an empire bill all summer.
His assets are about to be frozen.
I could care less about his bassets.
And besides, he's probably filtering his finances through some foreign government so that I won't know he's stalking me.
Well, what did he say when you saw him? Nothing.
He limped away, and I kept driving.
That doesn't sound very stalker-ish.
It's Chuck.
It's probably part of some elaborate scheme.
Well, he did have blood on his wallet, and you said you saw him limping.
Don't you think we should at least make sure he's okay? I'm sorry he pissed off the wrong pickpocket.
But I've been waiting for this date all summer.
I'm not gonna let him ruin it.
I'm sure Louis would understand if you're a little late.
Look I can't talk to him, s.
You don't know what it was like, seeing him, even through the car window.
Trust me, the only thing wrong with Chuck is that I'm gonna be happy without him.
Your oysters, Henry.
Here.
Hey.
Hey.
I thought you might be ready for a break.
I have to ask.
Your first day made me believe not all American are lazy.
I see you tomorrow.
Enjoy Paris.
Merci.
Merci.
Voila Monsieur.
What is wrong? Are you mad at me? No, you're perfect.
I was just thinking maybe this isn't the right place for us after all.
Why? Was working with Oncle Alphonse so horrible? It's not the job.
It's Paris.
But you loved it this morning.
And you slept through the night for the first time in weeks.
True, but I credit you with all of that.
I mean, we could live anywhere and be happy.
I hear India is amazing.
But we can barely afford the bus to Lorraine.
I may have a way to figure out the finances.
Well, that was an interesting call.
Was that Paris? News about Chuck? That was Dr.
Feiner from Lenox Hill.
Unfortunately, he cannot discuss Milo's medical records with anyone other than his parents.
I was just hoping to get some more information, make sure this guy's even a real doctor, not some s*x phone operator that crazy girl paid off to lie to us.
Oh, now who's crazy? Georgina went for a spa weekend right after Dan signed the birth certificate.
We need to get our own paternity test done while she's gone.
Well, she said we could.
It's not like we have to sneak around behind her back.
Now whatever you might believe, your son is in Brooklyn, struggling to take care of a baby.
So you can sit here and brood all by yourself, or you can come with me and help me turn Jenny's room into a nursery so that child has a proper place to sleep.
Well You know where I'll be if you change your mind.
Have you ever seen anyone sleep so deeply? I know you said things were complicated, but you and Dan really seem to click.
We do Or did, before the thing with Serena.
You have to tell her.
Dan made Nate promise not to tell you, so You can't say anything, but he does have feelings for you.
He told us himself.
Really? You should go for it, yeah.
My friend saw him around here this morning.
He has an intimate relationship with alcohol, so I figured I'd check all the bars first.
He doesn't drink here, but he looks very much like my new waiter.
Is he American, from New York? All I know is he came to Paris from, uh, Prague with my niece.
Well, if he's who I think he is, he could be in a lot of trouble.
I- I need to talk to him.
He doesn't do much talking, especially about himself.
Please, sir, I've been to every bar in the neighborhood.
And he's my stepbrother, and I'm very worried about him.
If you have any idea where he is, please Tell me you didn't rob a bank.
My grandfather left me a small inheritance.
I've just been waiting for the right thing to spend it on.
But it doesn't look small to me.
It's enough to get us to London, then Kerala.
Are you sure you wanna do this? I've never been more sure of anything.
Is it hot or cold in Kerala? Do we need shots? And what do I pack? Chuck, it's you.
Who's here? Oh, hi.
I'm Serena Van Der Woodsen.
I'm I'm really sorry to show up like this.
I've just been looking for Chuck everywhere.
Henry, what is she talking about? I don't know.
The man you're looking for is not here.
Holy Bruce Wayne, Batman.
It's one thing to hide who you really are.
It's another to pretend you don't exist.
I had no idea you had such deep appreciation for street food.
I'm quite surprised that your favorite restaurant is on Rue de la Huchette.
Yes, well, the masterpieces of the Louvre don't compare to the simple pleasures of the kebab.
Paris is complicated and beautiful Much like you.
But you know what's even better than street food? Street artists.
I heard there's an amazing bucket drummer at the Pont Neuf Metro station.
Should we investigate? Well, I was thinking more of a chauffeured drive in the country, to the ball my parents are throwing for the Givenchy exhibition.
Oh! Givenchy was Audrey's favorite.
Does that mean you- you'll allow me to escort you nothing would make me happier, except maybe saving this for later.
Hey.
Where's Milo? I gave him a bottle and put him down in your bedroom.
You know, he should really have a nursery.
Yeah, I know.
I've been meaning to get to that.
You hungry? Always.
I can't remember the last time that I ate something that didn't come out of a a box.
Did you do all this? I thought you deserved a bottle, too.
You've been under so much pressure, I can't even imagine.
I really missed you.
I missed you, too.
I know that I-I-I haven't gotten a full night's sleep in a while.
I don't really know what I'm saying half the time.
But I'm so grateful that you've been here helping me.
And after everything that that, you know, I put your through, which I haven't even apologized for, I haven't explained it stop talking.
You know I'm not good at that.
I think I can help.
I had a feeling you'd linger.
I'm not gonna leave.
Chuck, today I had to identify a body that the police thought was you.
Did you do something to that man? If if it was self-defense, I'm sure that they would understand.
I never touched that thief.
So is Blair right? Is this another one of your games? Do I look like I'm playing? I know more than anyone what it's like to want to reinvent yourself.
But just because people are mad at you doesn't mean you should disappear.
My mom is really worried about you.
I'm sure she'll come to celebrate my absence, as will all the people who've wished me dead since the day I was born.
I know things were bad in New York.
But if you don't come home, you'll lose the empire.
You'll lose everything you ever cared about.
I already lost the only thing I cared about.
They can have everything else.
I don't know what you told that girl, but you can't turn your back on who you really are.
I'm going to see an old associate, picking up a passport with my new name on it.
After today, there is no Chuck Bass.
I'm staying at Eleanor and Cyrus' when you realize that's not true.
Wow.
That was, uh Yeah.
I'll have to thank Nate the next time I see him.
Nate? I'm sorry, but, I mean, I don't mean to be a credit hog, but that was all me.
No, I mean, I'm just- I'm glad that he told me.
Told you what? The truth.
Wh about what? Okay, after I told Nate that I was nervous about you still being in love with Serena, he said that it wasn't true and that you told him you still had feelings for me.
And there it is.
I- I'll go.
Okay.
Oh, wow.
A coronation already? The date must've gone well.
Oh, s.
, we walked, we talked, we laughed.
I'd forgotten what it was like to just have fun with a guy.
And now I'm off to meet his parents at a ball.
Just look at all the gowns he sent! The fairy tale is back on as long as the evil queen doesn't ruin it.
Well, if you're talking about Chuck, don't worry.
The only person he wants to poison is himself.
You talked to Chuck? No.
I don't care.
I don't even wanna know what he said.
I've been waiting all summer to feel sparkly again, and I won't be pulled back into the darkness.
You're right.
Go live your fairy tale.
Don't worry about Chuck.
If that is Didier Ludot, tell them they should've been more prompt! Now, you this is all wrong.
I can't believe your people invented the coiffure.
Yes.
That's more like it.
I can't even see myself! Claire Von Rohr.
Gorgeous blonde.
Princeton.
Oh, and look.
Her family has a house by ours in Trancoso.
Okay, yeah, she sounds great, but I-I don't get it.
What are you saying? You're gonna go on a date with her.
Well, I thought the whole point was to be available.
The point was for Dan not to be.
You have to have somebody fabulous on your arm so Serena doesn't think that you spent the whole summer pining for her.
Here, let me call okay, listen, I appreciate the gesture, but you don't know Serena Van Der Woodsen.
Not just any hot girl is gonna spark her jealousy.
So what are you saying? You have a better option? Louis, merci pour tout No.
I can't do any more of these prince and pauper games.
I'm sorry, madame.
Monsieur simply asked me to escort you for one final touch before the gala.
Would you like to come with me to Harry Winston? Would I? Is there some business you need to attend to before we go? Nothing I have any interest in.
Escort away.
Blair, call me back.
Remember when I told you not to worry about Chuck? Well, I was wrong.
Spotted one American leaving Paris.
Au revoir, I'enfant terrible.
B.
, you know I wouldn't bother you if it wasn't serious.
I need your help.
Finally.
Inspector chevalier, of course.
Okay, I'll be right there.
It's beautiful.
I mean, of course, they all are.
Monsieur Grimaldi would want me to be sure it was perfect.
Like that.
Carats, clarity, charisma.
Not that I expect Louis to get me a ring so soon, but This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I am sorry.
This ring has already been sold.
Shouldn't you be out dealing with your own issues instead of hunting me down? I didn't even know you were here.
Why are you here? Why are you? I see that you have found monsieur Bass' stolen property.
Mr.
Bass' property? The ring is his? That's why I'm here.
Inspector chevalier asked me to claim it.
The thieves couldn't pawn such a valuable piece at their usual haunts in Prague, so they came to Paris to try to return it for the cash.
Harry Winston knew monsieur Bass was the original purchaser.
That's when they called us.
And the body you saw was one of the thieves.
So why was Chuck's blood on the wallet? Monsieur Bass would not let go of the ring.
He fought them hard, so they shot him.
Chuck was shot? Let me explain What the hell, man? You told Vanessa I had feelings for her? I just thought you two were connecting.
Why are we whispering? Is she still here? Yeah, she's yeah, just just keep whispering.
Okay.
Look, you guys spent all day together, just the two of you.
So? Just because things were great doesn't give you the right to lie to her about me.
Was it a lie? This is about Serena.
It is, isn't it? Okay, I wouldn't have said anything to Vanessa if you hadn't lied about getting that text.
What text? When's the last time you checked your phone? Obviously not as recently as you did.
Oh, man.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's from Serena.
I thought you saw it.
I got the same one.
Same one what? Um Uh, it it's a text from Serena.
Yeah.
So she's interested in both of you? Yeah, that's kind of what it seems like.
Yeah, or she's interested in one of us, and just wants to, like, let the other one down easy maybe.
Oh.
Is that why you told me Dan had feelings? Yeah.
I'm I'm sorry, Vanessa.
Oh, my God.
How stupid can I be to think you'd actually put Serena behind you? Vanessa, I'm Surprise! It's time for an extreme nursery makeover.
You know that ring was meant for you.
He was gonna propose to you on top of the empire state building.
I can't care about that.
It doesn't change what he did instead Jenny Humphrey.
B.
, I know how much he hurt you.
He knows how much he hurt you.
That's why he signed over the empire and everything he owns to my mom.
Well, hopefully she can run it without entering the human flesh trade.
Blair, he's changing his name.
His landlady said he's on his way to the train station.
This is Chuck we're talking about.
He really could just disappear.
If you're so torn up about it, stop him.
You and I both know you're the only one that can do that.
If you'll excuse me, I have a ball to attend.
Blair.
Blair, he almost died holding onto that ring and to the hope of you.
I forgave him for something that no one else in the world would ever get over.
Then he turned around and did the one thing he knew I could never let go.
But you don't need to forgive him.
You don't even need to talk to him again after today.
But I know you, and you will always regret it if you do nothing and just let him disappear.
I'm sorry.
I know.
The truth is, I don't even know how I feel about Serena.
I just I want a clear shot at finding out without I you don't have to say it.
Yeah.
How do you feel about her? I was in the middle of trying to figure that out when I was interrupted by the arrival of Georgina's swollen belly.
It was kinda kinda hard to focus after that.
I'll take your word for it.
You know, and being with Vanessa even if it is thanks to your meddling felt good.
And all of our problems from last year Tisch, whatever they just feel really, really small now.
Too bad she hates you.
Yeah, maybe.
Or maybe it's for the best.
I don't know.
Anyway, Serena gets back tomorrow.
What are we gonna do? I knew it was too good to be true.
Who is she? Just because you're dressed poorly doesn't mean you're not Chuck Bass.
Why would I want to be him? You should've told me you got shot.
I'm surprised you didn't shoot me yourself.
I have, many times, in my dreams.
The good ones.
But if you were really hurt, I would want to know.
When I woke up, my I.
D.
Was gone.
Nobody knew who I was.
Nobody was coming to look for me.
I realized I might be alive, but Chuck Bass didn't have to be.
Changing your name doesn't change who you are.
It's a good start, a chance to live simply, earn people's respect, maybe become a person someone could love.
Someone did love you.
And You owe it to her and everyone else you're leaving behind not to run away, which is what you're doing.
And I don't think that great man you're talking about wanting to be is a coward.
I think he would face up to what he did.
I destroyed the only thing I ever loved.
I don't love you anymore.
But it takes more than even you to destroy Blair Waldorf.
Your world would be easier if I didn't come back.
That's true.
But it wouldn't be my world without you in it.
It doesn't feel right to be in New York without you.
Did the plane ride back to reality land you on either Nate or Dan? Not exactly.
How could you spend seven hours on a plane with a library of romantic comedies and not find clarity? Trust me, I tried.
I even made a list of pros and cons.
Dan good shoulder to cry on.
Nate good shoulders.
Well, as long as you promise that Gossip Girl won't find out before I do.
I have a poll to win.
I promise.
How are you? Well, I ate too many meringues at lunch, but talking to Chuck made me realize what I want, too.
Good.
Well, I hope you get it then.
Merci, mon amie.
Thank you for calling me.
And you're right.
I'm sorry.
It was wrong for me to interfere.
Well, what was wrong was for me to hand over control of my life to a beautiful girl I just met in a restaurant.
Seriously, what was up with that? I'm kidding.
Blame all here.
No more life coach.
Friends? Friends.
I'd like to apologize to Dan as well.
I know this might actually sound weird, but I'm I'm glad that yesterday happened.
Why? Because after your publicly broadcast pajama party with Serena, you thought I needed more humiliation? No.
No.
Because last night when I read on "Gossip Girl" that Serena had boarded a plane home, I didn't care.
All I could think about was making things right with you.
Now whatever's happened in the past right here, right now I wanna be with you.
I hope your calling me means your business is complete.
It is.
I'm sorry I distracted you from your parents' ball.
In Paris, there's always another ball.
The Sarkozys are saluting Jerry Lewis tomorrow night, if you're not otherwise engaged.
There's nothing I'd rather do than salute Jerry Lewis.
But I can't live in this fairy tale.
I promise this is not a story for little girls.
But I've been using it to run away from my real life on the Upper East Side.
Someone there did something for me that I have to honor.
Will I ever see you again? You can always come find me.
It's Vivier.
It's worth a hell of a lot more than a glass slipper.
Look, Milo, you have a nursery.
Isn't it beautiful? It is.
He's a lucky boy.
Rufus! Is this the David Netto crib that I ordered? Oh, it's Dan and Jenny's.
I got it out of storage.
I wouldn't want my grandson sleeping in anything else.
I couldn't agree with you more.
What changed your mind? You.
I'll never be sure if Georgina's telling me the whole truth, but Dan is my son, and I'm not gonna bail on him.
And if I'm wrong, how much time have I lost with this little guy 'cause I let my suspicions get the better of me? Aw.
Here.
I'm gonna go cancel the other crib.
Would you take him? Okay.
Sure.
Hello, buddy.
Thank you.
Milo, I think you have the Humphrey jaw.
Mom! Hey! Serena.
Hi! Oh! Darling, what are you doing here? Laryssa told me where you were.
I came straight from the airport.
Well, we have a surprise for you.
Great, but first, I wanna find Dan and Nate.
Okay.
Find me? I'm right here.
Dan! And Vanessa.
Hey! Hey, Serena.
Nate.
Juliet.
Hi.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Hey, Serena.
Rufus and baby? This is Milo.
He's my son.
Son? You saw me four months ago.
If you thought I was pregnant, then I'm offended.
Okay, is someone gonna help fill me in? Not it.
Yeah, I-I-I will explain everything.
Just, uh, just sit down.
I gotta get him a bottle.
Uh, I'll get it.
With Dan spotted kissing Vanessa and Nate's early morning coffees with a new blonde, it looks like the oddsmakers have taken a beating.
Serena Van Der Woodsen will be walking onto Columbia's campus single.
This poll is now closed, and nobody won.
So when I grabbed your hand back there, you seemed to like it.
Was that just a part of the act, or do I actually have a shot at a date? You've been over Serena for, like, seven minutes.
You're not ready for me yet.
And when I am? You know how to find me.
Just as every summer ends, all tourists come home, all dreamers wake up, and new problems are born.
What's all this? Oh, it was laying around the nursery.
I thought I'd put it into a baby book for Dan.
That's a good idea.
Oh, is this Milo's hospital bracelet? Yeah.
Look how tiny his wrist was.
Huh.
Either this is a mistake or Or what? Milo's bracelet says his blood type is o-negative.
That's a universal donor.
That's not common.
Rufus, enough conspiracy theories.
Look, the closest you've been to medical school is having a Lincoln hawk song licensed for "Chicago hope.
" When Dan got his appendix out as a kid, I banked some blood just in case something went wrong.
He's a.
B.
Positive, same as me.
Okay, so Georgina is type o.
I'm sure she is.
Likely, so is Milo's real father.
And just like that, a pretty girl's ugly secret is revealed.
I had to improvise, but it's done.
I'll see you soon, and we'll talk about what's next.
Take care.
Hang in there.
I miss you.
When you didn't come home last night, I assumed you'd left with that girl.
I owe you an apology.
I don't expect you to understand, but where I'm from, people lie and cheat and destroy whoever gets in their way.
I did it better than any of them.
When you dragged me in from the alley, you didn't just save my life.
You gave me the hope of a new one.
Well, the you I've been living with never did anything to be ashamed of.
I hope I hope you'll bring some of him with you back to your world.
I fully intend to If you'll come with me.
To New York? You got me a ticket? We don't need tickets.
I'm Chuck Bass.
But no matter what the new season brings, we'll always have Paris.
Bisou bisou, Gossip Girl.
Hey, Serena.
Nate.
This is Juliet.
Here you go, grandpa.
This is Milo Humphrey, your grandson.
We need to get our own paternity test done.
Milo's bracelet says his blood type is o-negative.
Likely, so is Milo's real father.
I've been acting like I'm okay, but I'm not.
What if I stay like this forever? What if I never get over Chuck? When you dragged me in from the alley, you didn't just save my life.
You gave me the hope of a new one.
To New York? You got me a ticket? We don't need tickets.
I'm Chuck Bass.
I don't understand.
How can "Gossip Girl" be down my first day at Columbia? Maybe Gossip Girl get kidnapped? Unstable ex-boyfriend lock Internet tattletale in basement Dorota! What did I tell you? No more watching "Law & Order: SVU" while you're breast-feeding.
No, unlike those plebeians at N.
Y.
U.
, the students at Columbia actually respect and understand the power of Gossip Girl.
But how is my first day supposed to matter if Gossip Girl isn't around to tell people it does? Still nothing.
Good.
I forgot how exciting the first day of school can be a new fall wardrobe, fresh slate.
The fact that Gossip Girl isn't around to stir up trouble only makes it that much more perfect.
Or she could be planning something big for your first day.
After all, the site says "under construction," not, uh, "out of service.
" What are you doing up here? I was worried.
Just looking at your world.
It's magnificent.
So if you really are the big boss like you say, can you make it so that no one comes up here and disturbs us? I already made the call.
Well, the good thing about no Gossip Girl No Chuck.
What about you? You're the one who has to start college with an ex-boyfriend loose on campus.
Oh, there won't be any issues.
Nate and I are still friends, even if he is dating some gorgeous blonde named Juliet.
Oh, please.
You are Serena Van Der Woodsen.
We've been on campus what, five minutes? I bet there's already an entire frat house filled with guys fighting over you.
And don't worry.
My jealousy issues are as over as surf fabrics for evening wear.
Besides, we're carrying on our divide and conquer strategy from Paris.
But where will our neutral meeting ground be? Hot & crusty will not possibly do after Cafe Louis-Philippe.
But Hamilton house will.
So they do have a Columbia chapter.
You know, I always suspected Nate was a member, but he would never fess up.
He was right not to.
Their membership is so restricted they make soho house look like a halfway house.
So then how do we apply? We don't.
Incoming students are selected by an anonymous board of alumni.
If you dare to think you were chosen, you have to find the keymaster on the first day of class.
Either a key or white-hot shame awaits you.
Then let's go receive our new accessories.
Hello? I'm dreading this.
As much as the truth might be a relief, it's also the toughest thing he'll ever have to face.
Well, just be prepared.
Who knows how he'll react? He may not even believe you.
And genetics don't lie, even though some doctors who administer paternity tests do.
I'm here.
Wish me luck.
Good luck, my darling.
Hey, dad.
Is everything okay? Is Georgina home? No.
She should be back from her spa trip any moment.
Why? Why? What's going on? Hey, man.
I meant to give this back to you last night.
This summer was Very rewarding, but I'm done.
You and Serena back on? No.
No, but I'm good.
I, uh, I met this girl I like.
Now if I could only get her to go out with me.
Have faith.
If a good woman can change me, surely one can date you.
Good morning, Nate.
It's nice to see you.
Nice to see you, Eva.
Everything's so different.
I keep wanting to call him Henry.
It's a long story, but it has a happy ending.
Should I make us some breakfast? You don't have to make anything for anyone.
You can have whatever you want at the touch of a button.
Now Simone is waiting for you in the spa on the second floor.
Just tell her what you'd like to eat.
She'll have it delivered before your massage or after.
It's entirely up to you.
This is crazy.
Your life is perfect.
Now so is yours.
So, Henry, why do I get the impression that you might not have told her your whole life story? Wow, and I thought college was gonna be different than high school.
Who would want that? Sorry, but this is a private club.
No has-beens allowed.
Penelope.
Good to see you, too.
Long time.
Clearly, standards have slipped if you're a member here.
To whom should I speak to have you removed once we get our keys? The wall.
My great-aunt- she was a founding member.
Ah.
Nepotism.
That explains it.
Now if you don't mind, would you direct us to the keymaster and then get me some cashews? I'm famished.
Those two? We're so in.
Oh, no, it's her.
You know the keymaster? That's perfect.
Well, maybe.
We're here to get our keys.
Blair Waldorf, Serena Van Der Woodsen.
Hi.
We've met.
I'm sorry.
We have? At Dan Humphrey's, with Nate.
Oh.
Right.
Serena.
This is why I hate it when best friends show up together.
Unfortunately, I'm down to my very last key, which means only one of you made the list.
Only one? It's okay.
We'll find a different meeting place, like the library or bookstore or Starbucks.
This key is for Blair Waldorf.
Sorry for the silent treatment, gossips.
But everyone needs the occasional r & r, even yours truly.
Lucky for you, I observed a sacred upper east side tradition and had a little work done while I was gone.
Now enough with the pleasantries.
Time for the dirt.
I spy with my many eyes Chuck Bass returning from Paris yesterday with a pretty, new fall accessory.
But if she's the kind of girl you bring home to meet your stepmother, why is Chuck visiting lily solo? I'm so sorry.
I know how much Milo means to you.
I just can't believe this.
Why? Why would Georgina do this? How you want me to stick around till she gets home? We can talk to her together, figure this out.
No, no, I-I think I think I need to handle this on my own.
Thanks, dad.
Also spotted- lonely boy's baby mama looking like one hot mama on the beach in St.
Barts.
If she's flown the coop, who's cleaning up her baby's poop? And what about Serena and Blair? It seems our girls have started their college careers with a social call to Hamilton house.
I'm sorry, Serena, but this club is for members only.
Great.
I'll see myself out then.
But if b.
Is the one holding the key to the kingdom, guess Serena is out in the cold.
I'm sorry for what happened with Jenny.
She was in a bad place.
I could've helped her.
Instead, I just used her pain for my own self-destruction.
Thank you for the apology.
And welcome home.
Please don't disappear again.
I don't intend to.
I just hope everyone's as relieved to see me as you are.
Well, let's not ask for too much off the bat, shall we? So tell me what happened.
I heard about the mugging from Serena, but then I, um, met someone.
Someone wonderful.
She found me, nursed me back to health.
Her name's Eva.
So when do I get to meet her? When do you feel it would be appropriate to introduce her to everyone? I'm not going to lie.
You haven't exactly come home to a fan club.
But let me talk to Rufus and Eric, and, um, see if I can make some progress.
I'd appreciate that.
Why don't you bring Eva to fashion's night out tomorrow? Everyone can meet and mingle without the pressure of a dinner.
That sounds great.
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.
Serena, I don't have to accept.
Any club that'll only take one of us is a club I don't want to be a part of.
Blair, stop it.
I would never stand in the way of your social progress.
Besides, Hamilton house isn't for me anyway.
It's much more right bank.
That's why you're my best friend.
Hey.
Okay.
First day download dinner tonight? Sorella? Of course.
I'll see you later.
That's right.
It's "sparks.
" S-p-a-r I'm sorry.
Can you hold on one moment? Hello? Dan, hey.
Uh, we didn't get much of a chance to talk last night, but I was Is that Milo I hear? Serena, this is a terrible time.
I'm sorry.
Can I I'm I'm gonna have to call you later.
All right? Later, man.
Nate! How happy am I to see a friendly face.
Walk me to class? I'm really lost.
Can you help me, please? You know what? I'm I'm running late, so I'm sorry.
Okay.
You know, it'd be really great to catch for real, though.
Blair and I are going to dinner tonight.
Do you wanna join? We could start our own club.
Un, you know what? I'm already a part of this one.
I'm gonna go head in.
I'll call you back.
Chuck is in New York? He came to see me this morning.
Thought I would just tell you when I saw you.
Well, Eric told me first.
Apparently, it was on "Gossip Girl.
" You have every right to be upset with him, but we can't undo what's already been done.
He's trying to make amends, take responsibility.
What else is there? He met this woman who's had a big impact on him.
You can see for yourself how much.
I invited them to the party tomorrow night.
And I would appreciate if you would just give them both a chance.
Well, Jenny keeps telling me it wasn't his fault.
Maybe it's time I believed her.
Thank you.
? 318 00:15: 00:15:20,652 okay.
I'll see you soon.
What do you think of this one? If I answered out loud, I'd probably be asked to leave the store.
I'm afraid I have to go see my lawyer.
Apparently, disappearing for three months isn't good for business.
But I don't know which one is appropriate for the event.
Buy them all.
My card's with Leandra.
When you're finished, the car's waiting outside.
Bye.
Bye.
I don't know who's more excited that you're in the house the girls that wanna borrow your clothes or the boys that wanna take them off.
Oh, well, thanks for the warning on both counts.
But I have to ask why didn't Serena get a key? It just seems like kind of an oversight to me.
I agree, but maybe it's not the worst thing in the world.
Isn't it nice to have something that's just yours for a change? Oh.
Well, I I have to get back to campus.
Listen, I know that you said that you had plans with Serena tonight, but maybe you can stop by the house for a drink beforehand? Inaugural martinis are a hundred-year-old tradition, and so are the eager-to-please college boys.
I do hate to disrespect tradition.
Bye.
Leandra, help.
I'm stuck.
Oh, hello.
Blair, right? I'm Eva.
Yeah, I know who you are.
I'm just surprised to see you here.
Oh, Chuck asked me to come back with him.
No, I don't mean in the city.
I mean in Carlos Miele.
I know.
I can't believe it either.
Chuck is so wonderful.
He's buying me a dress for a party that his stepmother is look, if you wanna hole up in Chuck's hotel suite and feed him croissants, that's his business.
But introducing you to his family? My friends? Blair, I don't I don't wanna hurt you in any way.
Oh, you're the one that's gonna end up being hurt, ma biche, and not by me.
Chuck will soon realize that it doesn't matter if the dress is couture if the girl is off-the-rack.
And then, as with all things that don't fit, you'll be sent back to where you came from.
Oh, and by the way, if I were you, I'd wanna accessorize with some gloves.
Not even a manicure can mask those peasant hands.
And the only thing we know about Georgina's whereabouts is that she's in St.
Barts? I called every resort I could find.
There is no Georgina sparks staying at any of them.
She could've moved to a different island by now.
She she could be staying under a different name.
I don't know.
But she took- she took everything, Vanessa.
She took her passport.
She's gone.
She left Milo, and I don't I don't think she's coming back.
So we know you dated royalty.
Tell us what it's like.
Well, dating a prince isn't really different than dating anyone else, except instead of flowers, you get diamonds.
Another Martini, b.
? Actually, I think Penelope wants to get me a drink, to make up for the less-than-lovely welcome.
Hey, how far are you? I'm starving.
I am so sorry, s.
I totally lost track of time.
Can you hang on a second? Can I invite Serena? It's club members only tonight.
I'm sorry.
But don't tell her that you're here, though.
You saw her face when she didn't get a key.
I just I don't want her to feel bad.
Where are you? I'm just walking into my building.
The doormen are hopeless gossips.
You're not leaving, are you? You still owe us tips on dating royalty.
Can I take a rain check, s.
? I'm feeling more like a bubble bath and bubbly tonight.
I guess I'll just see you tomorrow.
Yeah.
Bye.
Thank you, Hamilton house.
Spotted b.
Holding court at Hamilton house.
Don't worry, s.
It's not your party, but you can cry if you want to.
I was hoping I'd find you here.
And I was hoping you'd find me.
So I was wondering, does volunteering at fashion's night out mean you can't bring a date? Not necessarily, but I prefer not to mix business with pleasure.
How long are you gonna make me wait? Serena's out of the picture.
Are you sure Serena agrees with that? That's why she doesn't get a vote.
How about I volunteer? And then that way, it can be work for both of us.
You don't give up, do you? I haven't had to try this hard before.
It's refreshing.
Were we supposed to meet up? Last night we were, but according to "Gossip Girl, " you had a better offer.
I'm sorry.
B.
, it's okay.
I know you're gonna have house events.
You just don't need to cover it up.
I know.
I was just drunk on gin and attention.
And Juliet told me that I shouldn't tell you because it would hurt your feelings.
And I know I shouldn't have listened to her.
Juliet the one who's dating my ex and swears she doesn't remember my name? She's concerned with my feelings now? If anything, she's the one behind all of this.
All of this? Oh, my gosh.
You can't believe you didn't get in.
You've never lost before.
This isn't a conspiracy, Serena.
Face it.
Hamilton house just didn't want you.
I got it.
Oh, my God! Did you just get a key? Yep.
And my mom said I'd never get in unless I lost 10 pounds.
She's a bitch.
Eva, are you ready? We should go.
What's wrong? You should go without me.
I thought you wanted to meet everyone.
Yesterday, after you left me at the shop, I ran into Blair.
Let me guess.
She took one look at you, radiant in a beautiful gown, and started shredding the dress and your self-esteem.
Some of what she said made sense.
That's Blair.
She wouldn't waste her breath hurling insults if she didn't think they'd land.
She reads people, senses vulnerability.
You just need to be stronger than that.
Easy for you to say.
You're used to all of this the cars and clothes, the spa, the roof.
I'm not like you or Blair.
When we walk into that party, you'll see me through everyone else's eyes, and it won't be so charming.
It's not true.
I'm glad you're not too comfortable here.
Honestly, it speaks to your character.
It's the reason lily will love you, why everyone will once they get to know you.
Okay.
I'll get dressed.
Can you Can you tell me all their names again? Lily Lily Rufus Rufus, Eric Serena.
You know, Elliot is the bow tie master in our relationship, so I guess I can't wear one now until he's home visiting from Yale.
Well, if your mother taught me, I can teach you.
Or we can call in the true expert.
Your mother invited Chuck and his new girlfriend tonight.
She feels strongly that he's changed.
After talking it over, I think that we should see for ourselves.
Everybody deserves a second chance.
A second chance, sure, but Chuck's had a bunch.
After a certain point, a person's beyond redemption.
Look, this is hard for me, too.
And as upset as the Jenny situation might make me, you just can't go writing people off.
You don't understand.
It's not like what happened between Chuck and Jenny was an isolated incident.
What do you mean not isolated? I shouldn't have said anything.
This is important, Eric.
What are you- -What are you not telling me? When Jenny was a freshman, Chuck tried to force himself on her at a party.
So I don't care what Chuck says about being a changed man.
What he did to Jenny this time makes it clear.
He has always been that person, and he always will be.
I'm sorry, Rufus.
All right, we're leaving.
We're not coming back here.
Well, what did they say? That Milo would go into foster care before he gets adopted, which could take years.
And until then, he would just be moved from home to home, you know, with no real family, and I couldn't even see him if I wanted to.
That's awful.
You think that's awful? There's an entire wall of photos covered with kids waiting to be adopted.
I-I don't care if Milo's not my biological son.
He's not going into foster care.
If Georgina does not turn up, I'm keeping him.
Juliet, hey.
Oh, hi, Serena.
Uh, I actually can't talk right now.
I'm running late to go help out downtown.
Oh, come on.
Don't you think you're going a little far to hold on to Nate? What are you talking about? Serena, if this is about the keys, as I said, there was only one left, and it was marked for Blair.
Really? Because I ran into a girl who got a key from you this afternoon.
Yes.
Okay, it's true.
There were more keys, but I thought that it would be even more awkward if I revealed that.
I don't determine who the keys go to.
The alumni committee makes that decision.
At least, they usually do.
What do you mean? It wasn't them who didn't want you in.
It was someone else.
Okay, then who? Blair? No, she wouldn't do that.
You were on the list until two nights ago.
And when I called to find out what had happened, they said that Blair Waldorf had called to give them more information about you, including Something about a s*x tape With a guy named Pete Fairman? Did you really think that she was ever gonna let you steal her spotlight at Columbia? Serena, I am so sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.
I just I would've hated for you not to know the truth.
They say old habits die hard.
Sorry.
But when it comes to Serena and Blair, old jealousies die harder.
And even if I drop out of school, it means I'd have to get a job.
I'd have to get a nanny.
You know, what if I get one who spikes Milo's bottle with Benadryl at nap time? I could maybe help.
Oh, you've been great, but this is more than, like, a-a good swaddle and formula runs.
I mean, I could move in, and we could work it out the same way you were gonna do it with Georgina.
And I have mostly morning classes, anyway.
Whoa, Vanessa, hold on a second.
This is way beyond girlfriend duty.
You know, you didn't sign up for any of this.
Neither did you.
And today's the last day I can withdraw from campus housing and get my money back.
Are you sure? If Ted Danson and Tom Selleck can do it, so can we.
Right? As long as it doesn't make me Guttenberg.
Hi, lily! So wonderful! How are you? Hey, have you guys seen Blair? Blair told me she was meeting Juliet at Diane Von Furstenberg.
Finally.
Nothing makes it a party like a Serena/Blair showdown.
Prepare your cell phones, ladies.
I'd never think I would be so nervous.
Hey, I told you, underneath all the pretty, they're all just starving wannabes.
Let's go find lily.
My husband Rufus and my son Eric.
How do you? Hello.
Heard so much about you.
On second thoughts, why don't, um, we get a drink? It might take the edge off.
Would you mind? Okay, yeah.
Thank you.
So are you gonna entertain us with another song this year? Why don't we top off our glasses? And we can discuss that in major detail.
Wonderful.
Ahem.
Rufus, Eric.
It's good to see you.
Okay, I'm, uh, I'm sorry you got a lot of nerve showing your face here.
I thought lily spoke with you.
She did, but that was before I found out you tried to rape my I know nothing I can do will make up for that night, but it was years ago.
I apologized to Jenny.
She forgave me.
Did something happen to change your mind? No, I just thought it was time Rufus knew the whole story between you and Jenny.
I'm glad I did, because now I can keep you the hell away from my family.
I understand your anger, and I'm truly sorry.
But I want you to know that I would never do anything to hurt your daughter or anyone else ever again.
If you'll excuse me As a father, it's my responsibility to make sure no one else's daughter gets hurt like mine did.
So where's this new girlfriend lily told me about? She should know what kind of a man you are.
Is that her? No.
It's obviously just another social climber making a play for Chuck Bass.
Whoever she is, she's not with me.
What's going on? Flash sale on wrap dresses? Better.
Serena thinks Blair blocked her from getting into Hamilton house and is going "Jersey shore" on her ass.
And "Gossip Girl's" streaming it live.
Oh, you couldn't stand my stealing your spotlight! Why wouldn't Hamilton house want you? Let's go see.
I love car wrecks.
Give it a minute.
Yeah, while you were at N.
Y.
U.
, begging for middle class minions, I had a job! You can't seriously be referring to your We can watch from here.
I learned a lot about the issues.
You mean your daddy issues.
Oh, like you're so healthy! "I love Chuck.
I hate Chuck.
I love Chuck.
I hate Chuck.
" Oh, and who do you love?! Nate, then Dan, then Dan again.
Aaron, Gabriel, Carter, Tripp, then Dan again, then Nate again.
Did your father finally fix that? 'Cause he seemed pretty busy giving your mom fake cancer.
I think we've seen enough.
We have to save our sister from that crazy bitch.
Turns out I'm not the crazy one.
Or the bitch.
Champagne? Spotted S.
and B.
discovering the joys of filmmaking.
Smile for your close-up, Juliet.
No, you don't really have the Humphrey jaw, but My name is on your birth certificate, so I'm gonna be your dad.
Vanessa's gonna be here, so that means you're probably gonna be the only kid at preschool who's seen "the battleship Potemkin" more times than "finding Nemo.
" Let's hope she brought some pizza 'cause daddy's starving.
You hungry? Oh! My sweet baby.
I missed you so much.
What the hell- what the hell you doing? Um, I'm back from the spa, and much refreshed.
Thank you for noticing.
Georgina, I know you weren't at the spa, and I know Milo is not my son.
Dan, I'm I'm sorry.
I-I can explain.
I don't wanna hear this.
You don't understand.
Someone was trying to kill me.
Admittedly, your ploy to blame me for Serena not getting into Hamilton house would've worked in high school, but not now.
Did you really think I would believe you over Blair? I don't know what you're talking about Or what just happened here.
We had Dorota film us earlier.
"Gossip Girl" played it as a favor.
She prefers to be the only one screwing with us.
Hey, Juliet.
What's what's going on? Serena's upset she didn't get into Hamilton house.
You purposely kept me out.
Why would I do that? Because you're jealous of her relationship with Nate and her friendship with me, obviously.
Whatever twisted frenemy/ex-boyfriend situation you have going on, Serena, it has nothing to do with me.
I told you that the alumni committee makes the decision you seriously thought we wouldn't know anyone on the committee? You can't.
That's the "secret" part of a secret committee.
Unless the keymaster misbehaves.
Half of the board members of Bass industries are alumni.
One phone call confirmed the obvious that Serena has always been at the top of the list.
Congratulations, darling.
Key, please.
Juliet.
Ladies, champagne? Juliet! Nate, are you really going after her? I didn't find your little show as charming as everyone else did.
Well, it wasn't meant to be.
What's going on? It's like ever since I got back, you're angry with me.
I-I thought we ended things as friends.
Serena, you cheated on me with Dan, and then you dumped me, and then you disappeared for the whole summer.
And you come back acting as if nothing's changed.
But I did.
And I guess it took me until now to realize just how mad I am at you.
When I got on the plane to Minsk, the guy from the bar wasn't in the seat next to me.
It was a Russian businessman named Sergi.
By the time we landed, we were platinum members of the mile high club.
Oh, why am I not surprised? We did it on the ground, too.
Um, anyway, everything would've been fine if he didn't tell his loony wife Oksana that I was pregnant with his child.
She threatened to kill me.
So then you escaped to Brooklyn.
But this is all just a cover 'cause you're really a Russian spy, like those women in Westchester.
No.
Uh, I mean, not that I wasn't approached, 'cause I was.
I came back because three guys named Boris were paid a lot of money to hunt me down.
And then I realized if I can make Oksana believe that it wasn't Sergi's baby, she would leave me alone.
I thought you were the only guy decent enough, at least who I slept with, to take on that responsibility.
I sent a fork to the paternity test.
It was Sergi's.
I just labeled it "Dan Humphrey.
" Is this all supposed to somehow be flattering? Yes.
When you signed the birth certificate, Oksana called off her cossacks.
You saved my life and Milo's.
And to show your thanks, you lied to me and you abandoned your son.
Look, I was free and clear on a beach in St.
Barts like a younger, hotter version of Kathleen Turner in "body heat.
" But I missed Milo.
I needed to come home.
I called my parents, and we spent the last 24 hours in an intensive family therapy session.
They're gonna let me move back in.
I-I-I'm truly glad that you've gotten your priorities straightened out here, but there there's no way that I'm letting you take this child.
I'm sorry, Dan, but it's not your choice.
He's not your son.
Georgina.
What's going on? Milo's going home.
Rufus told me what happened.
You probably shouldn't be seen speaking to me.
I explained to him that Jenny confided in me a while ago about the party and reassured him that she's put the past in the past and wants to move on.
I love you, Charles.
And if Eva is everything you say she is, I think she will, too.
Is this Chuck's limo? Can you take me to the hotel, please? Hey.
I couldn't find your car.
They all look the same.
Please let me explain.
There's nothing to say.
I told you this would happen.
Eva, it wasn't you I was ashamed of.
It was me.
What can you have to be ashamed of? Everything I did until the day I met you.
Look, I should've told you about my past, but I couldn't risk losing you.
Well, I'm going now.
So tell me, who the hell are you, Chuck Bass? Sometimes, you just have to come clean, no matter how many dirty secrets come out.
Charlotte.
Oh, I was hoping you'd be here.
Hey, Blair.
Will I see you at my show tomorrow? I wouldn't miss it.
Welcome home.
I'd like to say I'm glad, but the jury's still out.
Apparently, you met Eva.
Yeah, well, I told you to come home.
I never said it was gonna be easy.
Is she still with you? Not anymore.
Wow.
She lasted two days.
I'm impressed.
It was good to see you, Blair.
You didn't leave.
I'm not gonna lie.
It was hard to hear the things you've done.
But I've seen the man you can be, and I choose to believe in that man.
Come on.
Let's meet my family.
Hey.
I thought you left.
I had to oversee gift bags.
Some advice- don't get into a fight at a party you helped organize.
So, awkward question is it true you shut Serena out because of me? When Serena walked into Hamilton house, it just Sort of hit me.
Your ex-girlfriend was gonna be around all the time.
Well, that's an interesting reaction for someone who's not sure they wanna go out with me.
Maybe I'm more sure than I thought.
Once men have tasted caviar, it baffles me how they settle for catfish.
Hey.
How you doing? Uh, I'm okay.
I'm okay, I guess.
I just talked to my dad, and he he thinks I should keep busy.
You know, throw myself into more traditional college pastimes, like Noam Chomsky and beer pong.
Sounds like good advice.
Easier said than done, unfortunately.
Look, I don't want to bug you, but the van's double-parked downstairs with my boxes.
So should I just have them take everything back to the dorm? What do you mean? We don't have to do this, Dan.
I mean, we made this decision when we thought Milo was gonna be here.
I want you to stay.
Hey, I'm just curious.
Did you pack that hideous bath mat that your mom made for you? It's a prayer rug.
Oh.
Okay.
Well, is it wrong of me to pray that it got lost in the move? I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
It'll look great here.
Come help me.
So how was it, seeing Chuck with Eva? Harder than I expected.
But at least he's not going to Columbia.
No offense.
Yeah, I-I guess I just didn't expect Nate to be so mad at me.
I thought the only thing he got upset about was a badly rolled joint.
But we both deserve better, and now that we're at Hamilton house where we belong, we'll find it.
I don't know.
Even though I was right about Juliet, you were right about me.
I did assume college would be easy.
It'll get better.
After all, you are Serena Van Der Woodsen.
And you do have the best off-campus housing of anyone at Columbia.
What are you talking about? Follow me.
What?! Ta-da! It's your new bedroom! Oh, my gosh! Blair! I put Dorota straight to work the minute I got back from Paris.
You should've seen her yelling at the decorator while Anastasia was fast asleep in the ergo.
He say you cannot get wallpaper done in time.
I simply make clear he can.
So what do you think? Oh! Can best friends live together all year? Of course! Rumor has it that s.
And b.
Changed their relationship status from besties to roomies.
Friends or lovers, moving in is risky business.
Any time the rules change, you don't know how they'll change you.
We take the risk because the payoff can be so great.
But the truth is, we never truly know who we're living with Or the company they keep.
How are you? Depends.
How are things going? The guys were easy, but the girls are presenting a little bit more of a challenge.
Apparently, sisterhood is alive and well on the Upper East Side.
How long can that last? Exactly.
So you just keep your focus on not getting raped or killed.
It's a minimum security prison.
And you are hot.
Even white collar criminals get lonely.
Don't worry.
We'll get it done.
I promise.
Better watch out, kids.
Trouble's moving in, and it's looking to make the Upper East Side its bitch.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Gossip gril here, you're one of the resources into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
How are things going? The guys were easy, but the girls are presenting a little bit more of a challenge.
We'll get it done.
I promise.
There's no way that I'm letting you take this child.
It's not your choice.
He's not your son.
How stupid can I be to think you'd actually put Serena behind you? I'm not sure how I feel about Serena.
I just want a clear shot at finding out.
I, um, met someone.
Her name's Eva.
Chuck will soon realize that it doesn't matter if the dress is couture if the girl is off-the-rack.
And then, as with all things that don't fit, You'll be sent back to where you came from.
Overnight, our brooding billionaire's become a generous gentlemen.
But what's responsible for this metamorphosis? Or should I say who? Has a french fairy touched chuck With her magic wand? Or does simply being with an angel make you want to grow wings, too? #Have a heart, have a heart, have a heart# Sorry, miss blair.
No papers today.
I think maybe 8th steal them again.
Dorota, we both know that It was you, not Susan Lucci, who took my papers.
But there's no point.
It's all over the internet.
What is? What are you reading? Chuck gave Eva a limited edition Baignoire Cartier watch.
"Gossip girl" Even has a whole thread where people can guess how much it cost.
How can she even see Time through all that sparkly? I-I go get more coffee.
How can I stomach going to his charity gala later? Watching everyone "Ooh" And "Ooh la la" over that French floozy and that watch? Some are speculating it cost more than anything he ever gave me.
B, I know it's hard to see Chuck with someone else.
But you have to stop doing this to yourself.
I'm just worried about him.
We've seen this before! Strangers weaseling their way into our hearts.
Clearly, Eva has an agenda.
I'm guessing it's his money.
You know, Eva actually seems nice.
And even if she isn't, it's not your business anymore.
Oh! And it's your business to be monitoring Nate and Juliet? And even worse, Humphrey and Dumpty? Fine.
We're both having trouble moving on.
But it was just so easy in Paris.
You were so easy in Paris.
Enough.
But now-- Now you're here, and those boys are taken.
For now.
Yes, you're right.
Maybe Dan and Nate will see the error of their ways and break up with those girls, or they'll marry them, and you'll die hitting refresh.
Okay, fine.
You know what? I will stay away from Nate and Dan, but you have to stay away from Chuck and Eva.
No plotting, no meddling, no blair waldorf-ing.
I'm not going to.
I wasn't.
I was going shopping anyway.
Okay, then I'm just gonna stay home and unpack all day.
No gala.
And tonight we'll watch "Amelie" and try to recreate our favorite cocktails from Le tr`es particuliers .
Deal? Deal.
Hey.
How are you, sleepyhead? Ah, never better.
You making pancakes? Yeah.
I noticed you haven't been eating much, so I thought I'd make 'em for you.
And there's still time to take a shower.
Do you wanna change your clothes? No.
No, I'm good.
I'm fine.
You've been wearing that shirt for, like, three days.
Well, I'm sorry, mom.
I didn't realize when you moved in, you'd be--you'd be laundry monitor.
It's a beautiful Saturday.
I thought maybe we could go to the promenade, talk.
Talk? Talk about what? Your pancakes are burning.
Why did you bring out four plates? Don't be mad.
This has been going on too long, So I had to call for backup.
Something smells delicious.
Merci, Ivan.
So, Ivan, how did your mets do last night? Heartbreak as usual, Mr.
Bass.
Thanks for asking.
If I may, the flowers are right for the gala.
Simply beautiful.
As is the woman who choose them.
Hi! I'm sorry I'm late.
Traffic on Broadway.
Hey, I was calling you.
My phone died, drowned by a spilled latte.
No worries.
Oh.
Sorry.
I hope you two are coming to my charity event later.
Party on the roof? We wouldn't miss it.
Good, 'cause I'm announcing a $5 million charity.
What? $5 million? - Chuck, that's amazing.
What's the lucky organization? Poor thing can't make up his mind.
Petroleum apocalypse, the education crisis, poverty, disease, not to mention the recession.
It seems outside my Bassian bubble, the world is a pretty screwed up place.
Well, the good news is, whichever you pick will be eternally grateful.
If it's not too hypocritical, I think the situation calls for some champagne.
I'll join you.
Champagne.
Thank you.
So I didn't know him before, but I heard stories.
You're a great influence.
He's really changed.
I take no credit.
Old chuck, bad chuck, new chuck, good chuck.
To me, it's one man, one journey.
Wow.
You really are from Europe.
Why are you staring at me? Philanthropy? Chatting with the help about sports? It's nice to see you Nice.
Well, it's all Eva.
She cared about me before she knew who I was.
I guess I wanna prove her right.
How's things with you and Juliet? Good, I guess.
You know, I don't know why she's never invited me over to her apartment.
And she's extremely hard to make plans with.
And considering school just started, she's got an awful lot of homework.
Nathaniel, most people don't go from zero to monogamous so soon.
She's probably seeing other people.
No.
Nah, I don't think so.
Nate, I'm sorry.
I know I just got here, but my neighbor-- she's locked out, and I have her spare key.
So I have to go.
I'm sorry.
What are you-- Bye.
Okay.
Bye.
I thought her phone died.
So what is this, a talk-about-your-feelings intervention? No.
We just want you to know that we're here for you.
and that you do need to talk.
So, yeah, this is a kind of talk-about-your-feelings intervention.
All right, well, I'm fine.
Dan, you've been sleeping all day, cutting class.
I-I caught you watching "Wild hogs" and laughing.
It's okay to admit that you're depressed that Georgina took the baby.
Guys, I'm sleeping because I haven't in months.
I'm laughing because I-I finally got the stench of baby poop Out of my nostrils.
I'm relieved, all right? I mean, it's not like I've been hiding out here.
I went out.
I got a-- I got a haircut.
You thought Milo was your son.
You watched as he was born.
You held him in your arms.
You loved him.
But he wasn't mine.
He--he was--he was a waste of a summer.
Now if you will excuse me, thank you for coming.
Where are you going? I'm gonna go to Nate's.
Would've told you sooner, - but your intervention intervened.
I'll see you later.
I know what you're up to.
You're at cartier, checking the cost of that watch.
You're breaking your pact.
And you're looking at "Gossip girl," Thereby breaking yours.
Anyway, it just so happens that my watch is broken.
You were wearing it yesterday, and it worked perfectly fine.
Now it doesn't.
Blair, we had a deal.
B.
? Why did you stop talking? No reason.
Hey.
I know we haven't talked in a while, But I was taking a walk, found myself at your door.
Spotted-- one angel selling her halo.
Careful, Eva.
Returning that watch may cost you the time of your life.
Good afternoon, Chuck.
I thought we might enjoy some tea.
You know how I adore those empire bacon scones.
I know everything about you, which is why I know your visit Probably has more to do with a scheme than a scone.
Chuck, you've changed.
What makes you think I haven't? And speaking of your newfound affinity for the huddled messes, how is, the delightful Eva.
Leave her alone, Blair.
If you're as serious about her as Cindy Adams thinks, Then we'll be crossing paths all the time.
And don't you think we should be friends? Yay! There she is! Uh, don't worry.
Blair was just-- Sitting for some tea.
Scone? I'd love to.
Eva, I must apologize.
The first time we met, I had no idea you'd be the woman who could finally change Chuck Bass.
Oh, the Chuck I've known has always been kind and generous, Even when he had nothing himself.
You should've known him before he was shot.
Once, he sold me for a hotel.
Actually, Blair, she knows.
We have no secrets.
Blackmailers must be weeping all over town.
Eva, I read about Chuck's gift, And forgive me for being vulgar, But I've always wanted a Baignoire timepiece.
Might I see it? Oh, I-I don't have it on.
I brought it in to be resized.
Are you sure you mean resized? 'cause I think you brought it in to be returned for cash.
See? That is Eva selling the watch.
It is pretty-- the watch, I mean, Not the wad of hundies.
Though Eva might disagree.
Eva, what's going on? I needed the money for a friend.
That weak excuse might've worked in the former Vichy Republic, But Chuck and I are savvy new yorkers.
She gave me the money, Mr.
Bass.
Please don't be mad.
Ivan's mother was about to lose the house he grew up in.
At first, he was too proud to accept help, But I wore him down.
My valet.
W-why would you do that? I'm a stranger here, And Ivan is one of the few people who have been kind to me.
Your gift meant so much, but I couldn't wear something that decadent.
When it could save a family from losing their home.
I'm sorry.
Don't be angry with me.
How could I ever be angry at you? Just do me one favor.
Anything.
Pick the charity for me to give my money to.
Your heart'll find the right one.
Well, I'm sure you--you've that heard Milo's not mine.
Georgina took him back.
Yeah, my mom told me.
I'm sorry.
How do you feel? Vanessa and everyone keeps asking me that, trying to get me to talk about it, like it was this crushing blow.
But I just got my life back.
I wanna enjoy it now, you know? Okay.
Well, then we won't talk about it.
We'll just spend the day having fun.
Just you and me, okay? Uh, but first, I have to deal with this.
Sorry.
Hello? I saw Eva selling her watch back to Cartier for cash.
Are you kidding me? Then I went to Chuck's and witnessed her give the world's most credible altruistic excuse.
B., this is not what you promised me.
Hey, I'm gonna get a pretzel.
Is that Dan? That is not what you promised me.
No, it's different.
He came to me.
First, nonsense! Second, I really don't care right now.
Chuck's about to be taken for a ride.
We need to take that tart down! Now Humphrey has proven his worth in the past.
He could be useful to us now.
This is not a good idea.
Serena, do you remember when chuck gave his heart to his mother? That was the beginning of the end of everything.
Please.
Okay, what do you want us to do? Get on your computer.
I'll text you clues as I get them.
See? Needy dogs are the perfect cause.
Ohh, and so much cuter than those children with the cleft palates that you were going to pick.
We need to think in terms of the Bass annual report cover When making decisions like this.
I admit, Blair, when you ran into me outside the empire and offered to help me pick a charity, I was a little skeptical.
But you seem to have Chuck's best interests at heart.
Well, it's the least I could do after that whole watch snafu earlier.
I'm--I'm sorry again.
I guess I must just still be protective of Chuck.
Old habits.
But I still wanna be friends.
Tell me everything.
I wanna hear your whole life story.
Nathaniel, I'm on my way out to the What are you doing? These pictures of Juliet-- she's coming out of the 116th street subway station at 10:00 p.
m.
on nights she said she had too much work to go out with me.
You were right.
She's gotta be seeing someone else.
What do I do? Well, the old chuck bass would've told you to play the same game, make her jealous.
But the new Chuck thinks you should be honest.
Tell her how you feel, how much you like her.
I hope you didn't lose old Chuck's number.
Eva was just spotted at the park with Blair.
Eva's strong.
She can handle Blair.
I'll see you later.
So did you have dogs growing up? Well, I grew up on a farm in the Loire Valley.
We had lots of animals.
Oh, love the loire.
Which part? She grew up on a goat farm outside of Orleans.
They were cheesemakers.
This is ridiculous.
You don't have to stay here and do this.
No, it's okay.
I'm having fun.
I mean, we always have fun.
We do.
And hey, even though you may regret entering my world, at least you've developed terrific social espionage skills.
Well, as they say, adapt or die.
Ah, all right, as I expected, there are no regional cheese scandals of note.
What do we got next? I was in my first year of nursing school when my grandfather died.
Turned out he owed more money than the farm was worth.
So I dropped out of school to help pay for the bills.
I knew some girls who were going to Prague to look for work, and I decided to go with them.
And what did you do when you got there? Open an orphanage or tend to lepers? No, I waited tables.
I worked in a hotel for a while and sent everything back home.
Then I met Chuck, and the rest you know.
You met him in his hotel? Actually, I was in my room when I heard the gunshots.
I went downstairs and-- You found him? Well, when the ambulance didn't show up, I knew I had to do something myself.
So You're a beautiful blonde nurse without a mean bone in your body, and you literally saved Chuck's life? You make it sound like I'm an angel.
I just I just did what I had to.
Why do you think the ambulance didn't show up? Might have something to do with the neighborhood we were in.
Chuck isn't exactly the first person to get shot in Perlovka.
Voila.
Perlovka.
Wow.
You are good at this.
Not only am I manly and rugged, but I also have mad browsing skills.
Don't laugh.
Most women would be ripping their clothes off in the presence of this kind of web savvy.
Oh, really? I'm not lying.
Yeah.
Does Vanessa know you're here? No.
I told her I was going to Nate's.
Why'd you lie? Because After she moved in, things.
.
They've just been very weird.
They've been hard.
I mean, she keeps pressuring me all the time, and I I think the truth is, she's not convinced that I'm over you.
And I'm probably not.
Wait a second.
Perlovka? Is Blair sure about that one? What are you doing here? I wanted to make up for having to leave this morning.
What's up? Okay, this may sound a little creepy, but I read the thread about you on "Gossip Girl.
" I should've figured that was gonna happen at some point.
Have you been lying to me? Nate It's okay.
If you've been seeing other people.
I mean, we never said we were gonna be exclusive.
I just You know, with everything that happened with Serena, I need you to be honest with me about it.
I'm not seeing anybody else.
Nor do I want to, if--if you don't.
I don't.
But what were you doing then? I was visiting someone.
I promise you, I am not dating anybody else.
Hey, guys.
I'm here to kidnap Dan.
Where is he? The woman is a saint! She didn't recoil from those creepy cat rescuers or turn away from the pictures of those starving children.
She didn't even cringe when that homeless man licked her arm.
Well, she might be used to weird guys licking her.
yeah, 'cause she may be a saint, But she's also a prostitute.
Looks like eva's past may be Blair perfect present.
But what's more dangerous for chuck-- Eva's secret or what B.
may do with it? How do you find this? Well, when you told us where Eva first met Chuck, it's in Prague's red light district.
So almost as a joke, I looked up brothels.
And a lot of them have web sites.
Turns out Eva has good love for you.
I've never been so happy for internet p0rn.
Humphrey, you've done a fine job.
Serena and I can take it from here.

  Okay, but you may lose me to "Csi
Williamsburg.
" Serena made certain promises today that don't include you.
But, Dan, this is crucial information that has to be deployed expertly.
Please promise you won't tell anyone.
She means "Thank you.
" I'll call you later.
No, she won't! Serena, you have to come and help me find a dress for the gala.
But we said we weren't going.
Where else am I going to announce to the world that chuck's new lady is a lady of the evening? Do not embarrass them in public.
Pull him aside, tell him in private.
Let him handle it.
Can I at least look fabulous while doing it? You know, you didn't have to kick Dan out.
Serena, you promised to stay away from Nate and Dan.
Wait.
Are you telling me you chose? And that things with Dan and Vanessa are I think.
Maybe, yeah.
Well, as much as nature would applaud you for heading off any possible future Humphrey/Abrams offspring, You have to ask yourself, are you ready to do what it takes to make him yours? Seems like we both need to look fabulous.
Hey.
Dad, what are you still doing here? Lily went to get her hair done for chuck's gala.
I'm taking a pass, So I thought I'd get some of my stuff out of here and organize it at home, give Vanessa the closet space.
Didn't she find you at Nate's? Jeez, for kids addicted to their cell phones, you never actually seem to use them to communicate.
I was with Serena, actually.
Dan, you need to face what's really going on here.
Dad, nothing is going on.
I--Milo is gone.
I don't need to be an adult anymore.
And I was just--can't I have a fun day with a friend? Not if it involves lying to the woman you're living with.
Dan, talk to me.
When Milo was here, Every decision I made was for his benefit.
But now, I mean, I just-- I-I wonder if I made all the wrong choices.
When Georgina showed up here that day, pregnant I mean, I was-- I was about to fly to Paris.
I was gonna tell Serena that I loved her and I would do whatever it took to get her back, and Yeah, hold on.
Uh, it's--it's Nate.
I'm sorry.
I gotta take this.
Hey, man.
I was just about to call you.
I covered for you.
And I think Vanessa bought it, but you know I'm a bad liar.
Juliet took her for coffee.
What's going on? Um It's complicated.
Does "Complicated" mean you're cheating on Vanessa? No, no, no.
I'm not cheating.
I'm not cheating.
But I was with Serena.
I thought we both agreed to stay away from her.
I know, but this was a special circumstance.
Okay, forget me.
If you wanna be with Serena, you gotta say something to Vanessa.
No, it's not that.
It's not that at all.
I mean, Serena and I were helping Blair.
We Investigate chuck's new girlfriend.
Why would you do that? Because Eva's not who Chuck thinks she is.
That's--that's really all I can say.
Blair made me promise.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
So now-- Now your promises to Blair mean more than your pact with me? Or your relationship with Vanessa? Nate, she's a prostitute.
What? And I don't mean in a gold digger-ish, Eva's into Chuck's money kind of way.
I mean she's, like, got a web page and a price list.
But you can't tell Chuck.
Please, please don't tell Chuck.
Blair wants to deal with this on her own.
Yeah, I bet she does.
Hey, uh, I'll talk to you later, okay? Cookies were definitely a good idea.
I couldn't let you go back to Brooklyn without any nourishment.
I'm sorry you missed Dan.
Mildly convincing.
You're a slightly better liar than Nate.
But you did not see Dan at all, did you? He's going through a hard time.
Look, I don't mean to pry, but hard time or not, why would Dan lie to you? I don't know.
Because he's looking for an excuse to get away And not deal with everything.
Okay, so why not just go to Nate's like he said? Because Nate would probably see that he's upset and try to make him talk about it.
So he went to the one person he knew would be happy to help him avoid.
Serena.
I don't know what to do.
Confronting Dan now will only push him further away.
Well, if you ask me, the only way to stop this is to confront Serena.
And I know just where you can find her.
Nate Archibald has his "I hate to tell you this" Face on.
Blair's been looking into, uh, Eva's past.
Well, we can't be too surprised about that, can we? She found something.
Eva is-- or, at least she was-- um Chuck, she's a prostitute.
Nathaniel, I may be nice, but I'm still me.
You think I didn't already know this? Oh! I Of--of course you did.
Look, I'm sorry.
Um, just be careful, okay? Knowing Blair, she's gonna try and out this whole thing at the party later.
All right? Whew.
I'm gonna go deal with this stuff.
You sure you don't want to keep me company? Yeah, no, I-I-- Vanessa just texted that she's gonna be out late with friends from school.
So I thought I'd catch up on some reading.
You guys really do need to talk at some point.
I know.
Tomorrow.
We're gonna talk tomorrow.
Hey.
Hey, Dan.
I know it's last minute, but our conversation got interrupted earlier, and I wanna know if you wanna go with me to Chuck's charity thing.
We could talk.
Yeah.
You know what? I'd love to.
Perfect.
See you later.
What do you think? You know.
Do you see Serena? I'm sure she's around here somewhere.
Let's take a lap.
We're gonna go to the ladies room.
Will you check this? Sure.
Thank you.
Okay, where's Chuck? I don't know.
But, B.
, don't you think you should give him a few minutes to enjoy his event before you blow up his world? Fine.
Where's Dan? I don't know, but I know he'll show up.
You two look gorgeous! Thank you.
So do you.
Though I do question your manila evening bag.
Oh, well, uh, the Paris police sent me Charles' effects about a week ago-- money clip, passport.
You know, I just keep forgetting.
His valet is right over there.
He'll drop it off in Chuck's suite for you.
Wonderful.
Thank you.
Look here.
Chuck, look right.
Chuck! Chuck! Chuck! That'll be enough of that for one evening.
Thank you.
I'll see you in a minute.
Yeah.
Chuck.
Blair.
So how's the humiliation gonna go down? Did your scheme team find Eva's pimp? Is he gonna roll up to the press with platforms on? No.
Oh.
Well, maybe you'll project a s*x tape of Eva and one of her Johns as I make my way up the dais? Chuck, I'm not trying to humiliate anyone.
I just wanted you to know the truth, But obviously you already do.
Yes, and I don't care.
How can you not care? This is your mother all over again.
You're giving your heart to a moneygrubbing harlot who only cares about herself.
Please don't do this.
You just can't stand to see someone finally change me, And it wasn't you.
Well, if you believe that, then you really have changed, Because now you're a fool! Ooh! That dress is not fair.
Dan.
I'm so glad you came.
There are actually some things that I wanna tell you.
Well, good, because there's some things I wanna tell you.
Oh, isn't that just adorable? Hi.
There you are.
What are you still doing with my coat? I thought you said-- Ben needs to see you.
Nate, you don't understand.
Oh, the reason I've--I've never been to your apartment, The reason you're so hard to make plans with-- You have a boyfriend.
Ben's not my boyfriend.
You know, you hate Serena so much 'cause you're exactly like her.
Hey.
No, don't.
Just--just go.
Serena had nothing to do with any of this.
Really, we're just-- we're friends.
If that was true, you wouldn't have lied.
Vanessa, I'm sorry, but I-I had fun today for the first time in a really long time.
Good for you, Dan.
I'm--I'm glad that serena's so fun, And I'm sorry that I'm not, but I'm just trying to make you deal with your feelings, with your life.
Every second of every day.
I'm trying to help you, because that's what adults do in an adult relationship.
But if you wanna run around and be with Miss fun-all-the-time, that's your choice.
But you better make sure she's choosing you, too.
Did she tell you why she didn't call you all summer? Or explain to you why she texted you and Nate the same day she was coming back? I've always only wanted you, Dan, but even I have my limits.
Take care.
How'd it go with Dan? Well, Vanessa showed up, so they're talking now.
I don't know what's gonna happen, but I feel terrible.
How'd it go with Chuck? He knew, but he didn't care.
Well, I guess that's good news then, right, if you were just doing this to protect him? Yeah.
You don't want him back, do you? I'll never forgive him.
I just wanted to save him.
Why don't I get you another drink? Thank you for understanding.
I didn't judge your past.
I should've known you wouldn't judge mine.
I understand more than you know.
Just don't lie to me again.
On behalf of the Manhattan Philanthropic Community, Thank you, all, for coming.
Now I know we're all dying to hear chuck's announcement.
So without further ado-- Mr.
Bass.
Thanks, Kick.
When, uh, selecting a charity for my donation, there were so many worthwhile causes, I was confounded.
Then I realized there was one person who would know the answer-- Someone who had turned her life around and helped me turn around my own.
Tonight, I'd like to announce a new charity-- the Eva Coupeau Foundation.
I will be donating $5 million to the woman whose name it bears.
It is at her discretion to decide who deserves the help most.
She fell in love with me when she didn't know that I was Chuck Bass.
And tonight, I show her who that man really is.
So introducing mademoiselle Eva Coupeau.
Ivan, I'm gonna need to see that envelope Lily gave you.
I think I left something in it.
Thank you.
I don't know what to say.
This is so unexpected.
But Chuck put his faith in me Thanks.
Eva, would you mind if I had a word with Chuck? It's important.
Why not, Blair? What more can you possibly do to me? Be right back.
What do you want now, To tell me Nate's running a secret drug ring? Well, if he was, you'd probably make him the C.
E.
O.
of Bass Industries.
You have 20 seconds.
I thought finding out your honey was a hooker would be enough to sway you, but you've just rewarded her for her tricks.
Pun intended.
14 seconds.
I didn't wanna tell you because I didn't wanna break your heart, but after hearing your little speech, -I feel like I have no choice.
7 seconds.
You said Eva didn't know who you were when she fell in love with you.
But today when we went back to your room, I saw something that proves she did.
I don't believe you, Blair.
Deny all you want.
Then I'd avoid the inside pocket of her suitcase.
What were you doing in her suitcase? Snooping, looking for dirt.
But I never thought I'd find your passport.
That's impossible.
When I woke up, my passport was gone.
The muggers took it.
Or Eva did the night she found you.
The night she made you her mark.
Hey, have you seen Chuck? No.
You okay? You look a little upset.
I think I just broke up with Juliet.
I mean, I know you hate her.
Doesn't mean that I wanna see you hurt.
You need to talk? You came here with Dan, huh? Yeah, I did.
Nate, if you ever need me I'm here, always.
I'm sorry.
I really am.
I just thought you should know.
Chuck.
There you are.
I'll give you two a minute.
What is it? What's wrong? Did you know who I was when we met? You know I didn't.
Why are you asking me this? I found my passport in your suitcase.
What are you talking about? I should've known.
You lied about the watch.
You lied about your former career.
Is that what you think of me? I let you in, told you everything-- the whole story of how my mother and my uncle tried to take me.
You sat there and you thought, "I'm next.
" I'm sorry.
I'll pack my things.
Only the things you came with.
You okay? I'm stupid.
How could I ever believe someone good would actually love me? So what happened with Vanessa? I saw you talking to Nate.
Yeah, he was having some problems.
Listen, when you texted me from Paris that you wanted to talk, I thought it must've been because, you know, you were--you were thinking about the night before you left, - Like I have.
Well, I had been.
When you came back, I thought seeing Georgina and the baby must've changed things.
I also knew that you texted Nate, But I assumed it was to tell him it was over.
I guess that's what I wanted to believe, though.
It's not the truth, is it? Well, there was a lot of unfinished business between all of us.
I need to know.
When you came home, were you coming home to me or him? Honestly, Dan, I was trying to choose.
Serena, there are some people who don't need to choose.
Charles, thank you for a lovely evening.
I am so proud of you.
And I had Ivan put your things in your room.
What things? Um, the package from the Paris police.
Your personal effects, passport, That they sent last week.
Uh-oh, Chuck.
Looks like "B" stands for betrayal.
Charles, are you okay? Can you catch your angel before she flies away? Eva, stop it.
Look, I'm so sorry.
I-I should never have doubted you.
I made a terrible mistake.
You did, and thank you for saying that.
Look, you are pure and perfect.
I will make this up to you, I promise.
Chuck, I have to go.
No, look, you don't.
Blair set us up.
I know better now.
Of course Blair lied to you.
She's a liar.
But you chose to believe her.
You're still connected to her.
I see it when you're together.
I can I can feel it when I'm in the room.
So let's go away.
Just you and me.
Let's go back to paris, wherever you want, right now.
You'll always feel the pull of new york.
This is your home.
And now it's time for me to return to mine.
Don't leave.
Everybody leaves.
You're Chuck Bass, and that means something different now.
Don't forget it, and don't forget me.
Nate, you're right.
I have been lying.
Ben's my brother, and he's troubled.
He takes a lot of time and energy and has caused a lot of problems in every relationship that I've ever had.
Look, I want to tell you everything.
I'm just I'm not ready yet.
But I promise you, I won't let him come between us again.
Well, I don't know if you've read anything about the Archibalds, But we have a lot of skeletons in our closets.
And we have mansions full of closets.
So I guess I can deal with one brother.
Maybe I can show you my apartment now? Hey.
I-I didn't think you'd still be here.
Yeah, I put my stuff in these boxes, And then I realized I don't have anywhere to go.
Vanessa, I don't want you to go anywhere.
You were right about everything.
Serena is She's serena.
And I I was just avoiding you and avoiding myself.
It's a really weird, embarrassing thing for a college guy to be admitting, But I Losing Milo broke my heart.
I know.
Mine, too.
I love you.
And I don't regret any of the decisions that I made about Milo or having you here with me.
No Dan? And in that dress? I'm shocked.
Yeah.
I guess it's for the best, though.
I mean, if I end up with Dan, a part of me will always love Nate.
And if I end up with Nate, a part of me will always love Dan.
So I don't know.
I guess I just need to find someone who gives me what I get in both of them.
That's a mature decision.
Not sure I've made any of my own for a while.
What do you mean? Miss blair, Mr.
Chuck is here.
I know what you did, Blair.
It's despicable, even for you.
Do you hate me so much you can't stand to see me happy? No.
So why did you drive the person I care most about out of town? Eva left? Chuck, I never meant to-- Make her leave me? Of course you did.
I need to know why.
Is it possible you still love me? How could I still love you after what you did? So you did it just to hurt me.
Eva made me into someone I was proud to be.
You just brought back my worst self.
This means war, Blair.
Chuck-- Me versus you.
No limits.
Ms.
Sharp, wait.
I have that package for you.
Hold the elevator for me.
The owners will be back tomorrow.
In the prestigious buildings of Manhattan's elite, sometimes the door we open belongs to someone else.
Thank you.
I'll have these cleaned for you in the morning, sir.
I ran into Miss Eva.
She said she was leaving.
I'm sorry.
She'll be missed.
Ivan, you're fired.
And sometimes we let someone in, Only to be left out in the cold.
Yet sometimes, Despite what we may want, the door just has too many locks.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
"Gossip Girl here, your one and only source into of the Manhattan elite.
I get into Columbia.
And what if Columbia's a disaster, - and we lost each other for good? - And what if it's amazing and we become closer than we've ever been? I'm not seeing anybody else, nor do I want to, if you don't.
Last night don't even finish those words unless unless they end with "was a mistake.
" Ben's my brother.
He takes a lot of time and energy.
How are things going? The guys were easy, but the girls are presenting a little bit more of a challenge.
I know what you did, Blair.
It's despicable, even for you.
Do you hate me so much you can't stand to see me happy? No.
Why did you drive the person I care most about out of town? You just brought back my worst self.
Morning on the Upper East Side, where even our own blonde birdie has been spotted flying the coop early to make it to her morning classes.
Leave it to Serena Van Der Woodsen to make geek chic.
Who knew Ivy would look so good on her? Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you kidding me? Hey, you again.
Yes, me again, getting my cab taken by you again.
Nice bag.
I like it better than the one you had the other day.
Thank you.
It's supposed to be at class with me.
I can't be late again, so if don't mind Sorry.
She had an audition.
Something Ah.
I think a talking dog was involved.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Why don't you let me make it up to you? Buy you a drink sometime? Are you seriously hitting on me while still holding your date's shoes? Well, if you change your mind, the king Cole bar is the only place in town that still makes a red snapper.
You look like you're about a size 8? Taxi! Indra Nooyi, Ann Moore, Andrea jung.
Why are these all businesswomen? We color-coded for easy reference.
Businesswomen are in green.
Women in academia are in blue.
Politics and government in red with a subsection on royalty and dictators.
Ooh, files.
What's going on? Researching women of power so I can better forge my path to become one.
Sarah Louise Palin? Do you even want to be a Minion? B.
, uh, can I talk to you for a minute? I need advice.
Yes.
Five paces behind for privacy.
Ten for you.
What? How are you? I've barely seen you all week.
Uh, I've been great.
You know, with Dan and Nate behind me, I really feel like I can bury the old me and start anew.
May you rest in peace.
The only problem is, I've been late for my English lit class a few times, and lates count as absences, which is 10% oh, if only there were a device of some kind to keep the time.
S.
, listen to me.
College professors have a God complex, so just meet with him and say you're sorry.
The simplest way to turn an enemy into a friend is to seek their counsel.
Who taught you that? One of your Asian "art of war" gurus? Martha Chamberlin.
She's guest lecturing a series called the psychology of business.
I'm heading to the registrar's to sign up.
Oh, I love her.
B.
, how do you do it? Chuck declares war, and you simply up your class load.
The more time I spend on campus, the safer I am.
Chuck is allergic to education and bettering himself.
Well, I'm not, so if I'm gonna work on my new self, I should head to the library.
Sign me up for Martha's class.
We'll go together.
Your guitar tuner? Really? You have the worst poker face ever.
Okay.
Fine.
Dan hasn't been returning my calls, and I wanted to make sure everything was okay with you guys.
Everything is better than okay.
Dan and I had a marathon talk everything that we haven't dealt with, including Serena.
And from now on, there's no more secrets or surprises.
Well, that's great.
Never doubted you guys for a second.
Seriously? You need to practice in the mirror or something.
I don't know how they let you live on the Upper East Side.
That's great you and Vanessa sorted everything out, Dan.
You know, we should double.
Juliet and I are going to this faculty and friends mixer tomorrow night at the Hamilton house.
You guys wanna come? Mm, no.
There's free appetizers, Humphrey.
Oh.
Okay.
Fine.
You wanna go see a movie afterward? No can do.
Oh, come on.
That sounds great.
No, Juliet and I have this nice little evening planned after the mixer.
Got some champagne, new Matteo sheets, and I'm hoping some recently purchased lingerie.
It's for her, right? Wait a second.
I'm sorry.
You guys haven't, uh No, I haven't.
No.
I did the spend the night at her place, but I took a page from the old Humphrey playbook, and we just talked and played scrabble.
That's nice.
Thanks.
By the way, thank you for, uh, inviting me today.
You know, after everything that's happened between us yeah, yeah.
I missed you, too.
No hugs.
You're not getting a hug.
Not one? Not one.
I'm sorry I didn't visit last week.
Things are really ramping up at school.
The good news is that Serena is now isolated from both Dan and Nate.
What about Blair? Blair will get distracted eventually.
Oh, come on.
It was only a few weeks ago I went after Serena at Hamilton house.
If I get caught trying to get her expelled, it's over.
Not if you have a fall guy.
Maybe Someone with pretty blue eyes and a history with Serena? Have you been spying on me? Spying implies a lack of trust, and I know that I can trust you.
I'm only dating Nate to stay in Serena's orbit.
Good, because we agreed that we would not stop until Serena was left with nothing, just like I was.
And the next thing to take from her is Columbia.
And seeing as how you're in with these people, it shouldn't be too hard, right? I know what to do.
There you are.
Where do I sign up for Ms.
Chamberlin's lecture series? What are you doing here? Go, lions.
No.
That's impossible, even for you.
The dean's extended me the courtesy of auditing a few classes.
We felt it was important I get a feel for campus life before breaking ground on the new Bart Bass memorial rotunda.
What? It's a building with a circular ground plan, usually covered by a dome.
I know what a rotunda is! You can't be here.
Columbia's mine.
What do you want? Funny, last time we spoke, I thought I was crystal clear.
You took away what I cared about most.
To return the favor, I'm going to take Columbia away from you.
Come back later and sign me and Serena up for Martha's class.
But do it quietly.
I don't want Chuck to know.
Go! This just in looks like you can take the girl out of the party, but not the party out of the girl.
* I'm livin' in the 21st century * * Doin' something mean to it * * Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it * * Screams from the haters, got a nice * Rumor has it our favorite blonde could be spreading more than just good cheer.
And if it's true, then there's a test out there a few of you might not be able to pass.
Does s.
V.
W.
Have an s.
T.
D.
? I mean, who would lie to Gossip Girl like that? Do you really want a list? Because I don't know if I have that kind of time.
A good scandal is one thing, but even Gossip Girl likes to keep things classy and somewhat true.
I just wanted to focus on school.
Well, don't let this stop you.
Without someone confirming the rumor, it'll blow over by lunch.
And just keep doing what you're doing.
Hold your head high.
This is our school.
We were here first.
Damn him to hell.
Why do I get the feeling your pep talk is not entirely meant for me? Chuck is here, at Columbia.
Wow.
He's bringing the battle to campus? Yes.
Well, I already have a battle plan.
I found out that Martha Chamberlin takes a student assistant when she lectures.
That position will be my own private island against the storm that is Chuck Bass.
If you're not gonna let a disease like Chuck deter you, what leg do I have to stand on? I'm gonna go plant myself in the quad, act like I don't have a care in the world, and e-mail my Professor to see when he can meet.
Okay, it says here that you both slept with Serena And Vanessa, and that Vanessa also slept with Chuck Yeah.
Who slept with Blair? All that's on "Gossip Girl"? Yeah, she made a chart, actually, which I have to say is very helpful.
Oh, God.
Can we talk? Yeah.
Thank you for meeting me before your game.
I just I thought that we should talk about this before we spend our first night together.
You know it's just a rumor.
It's not true.
And even if it was, I haven't slept with Serena since, like, last spring.
So? So I think I would, you know, know.
Nate, symptoms can be dormant for months or not even appear at all.
You could still be a carrier.
What? I'm a girl.
I paid attention in health class.
So you want me to get tested? I mean, I'm not worried, but if it makes you feel better, I'll swing by the health clinic after the game.
Thank you.
And I promise you, when you see the outfit I bought for tomorrow night, it'll be well worth it.
Vanessa, like I told you on the phone, I'm sure it's totally false.
And and what business is it of yours anyway? You and I both got tested when we first started sleeping together.
You remember that? I sure do, and I have not been with anyone else since.
Dan, Serena was sleeping in your bed and wearing your t-shirt.
If something else happened, I need to know.
Nothing else happened.
W-what what happened to our big talk? 'Cause honestly, I don't know if I can have this same conversation one more time.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
It's just the blast freaked me out.
It's okay.
I promise.
I promise you have nothing to worry about.
All right? I'll call you after the game.
Serena.
Hi.
How are you? Great.
Why wouldn't I be? If you're referring to the unconfirmed vicious rumor on "Gossip Girl," you wouldn't have anything to do with that, would you? No.
Look, I just came over here to tell you the way our English lit Professor called you out in front of the entire class? You didn't deserve that.
And if there's anything that I can do No, I already e-mailed him.
I'm hoping to talk with him myself tomorrow.
Good.
Well, anyhow I really didn't have anything to do with that blast.
Believe me, it's the last thing I would've wanted.
What do you mean? Nate sort of freaked when he saw it.
Freaked how? He doesn't believe it.
Thanks for coming with me, man.
No problem.
I shouldn't have told you about the cotton swab thing.
That was insensitive.
But, you know, just think about how happy you'll be with a clean bill of health tomorrow, right? Yeah.
Yeah.
What the hell are you doing? And you? It's been what, two years? I'm a wingman.
You wanna go sign me in and I'll see you in there in a minute? Yeah, I'll step away now.
All right, cool.
Nate, I know all about your summer of love from Chuck's little black book, and honestly, for your sake, I hope you do get tested.
But if you do it today, people will just think that you believe the blast.
You'll be confirming the rumor.
Please.
Please just wait a few days or go somewhere else.
Serena, there's someone else I need to do this for.
Okay? And right now she's my priority, not you.
* I wanna tell you there's a really good reason * Ms.
Chamberlin's largest client to date? National rifle association.
She created the mama bears campaign, increased female membership by a third.
And the cherry pie? Her first major success was branding a cherry pie recipe for "better homes and gardens.
" How do you get from "better homes and gardens" to the n.
R.
A.
? It's a short trip, believe me.
Ms.
Chamberlin? I'm Blair Waldorf.
I'll be in your psychology of business class.
Well, nice to meet you.
I'm not having office hours yet actually, I was hoping we could discuss the assistant position.
I'm a big fan.
Unfortunately, the position has been filled.
By who? Ms.
Chamberlin, whatever Mr.
Bass has told you, I assure you, he has no interest in your class or any idea who you even are.
Thank you? On the contrary, once I decided to rebrand the empire, there was only one name on my list.
We can talk more as I walk you to your limo.
Thank you.
Good day, Ms.
Waldorf.
If you have any questions regarding the class, Mr.
Bass will answer them.
Actually, it turns out Ms.
Chamberlin's class is overenrolled.
You didn't make the cut.
Sorry.
Mmm.
I almost forgot how much I used to enjoy your pie.
Better batten down the hatches, b.
Looks like your island in the storm was just hit by a Bass 5 hurricane.
Where are you off to? Uh, campus.
My Professor agreed to meet with me during office hours.
Oh, good for you.
We can't let the men of our past define us.
They want us to lash out, lower ourselves to their level.
But it is our job to remain civilized.
So you're gonna let Chuck have the assistant position then? I said "civilized, " not "lobotomized.
" Oh, Ms.
Chamberlin.
So good of you to come.
Earl Grey, if I'm not mistaken? What is going on? It's better not to know.
Plausible deniability.
Ms.
Waldorf, the only reason I agreed to meet with you is because your mother and I have crossed paths on occasion, and I felt it a professional courtesy.
Oh.
Did you know that my mother remarried? Amazing man.
Your point? I was sorry to hear about your unfortunate divorce a few years ago.
I beg your pardon? Oh, boy.
You and I both know that power is the greatest aphrodisiac except, of course, when women have it.
Your ex-husband, for example.
I mean, the nanny? How cliche I'm listening.
My stepfather has surrounded himself with people who are not intimidated by a woman's success.
One of the partners at his firm is exceptionally attractive.
And I don't mean to sound forward, but I'd love to introduce you at the Hamilton house party tonight.
Well, I was going to be at the party anyway, so Well, then I'll make the call.
That is, of course, if the assistant position is still available.
Let's just say that nothing is set in stone.
Hmm.
I'm sorry.
Did you say scone? No! No, no, no, no! I don't care how late she is for her audition.
Flight attendant.
So quick to judge.
How's school going? Terrible, which is why I can't be late.
You know, if it helps, I could get you a copy of my schedule so we can stop doing this.
Come on.
Why would we want to do that? You put a different girl into a cab every day.
If you think I would ever be one of them, you are out of your mind.
I think nothing of the sort.
In fact, I leave at this time on purpose, hoping to get to see you.
Good.
Then I'm taking the cab.
Scoot over.
Hey.
What are you doing here? Hey.
Uh, uh, lily's not around, right? Uh, she and Eric are visiting colleges.
It's just us.
Why? Okay, well, there there's - there's a rumor going around that Serena has, um She has she has something.
Has something? Yeah.
Please get there faster.
Oh.
Y-you mean oh.
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's not true.
But there was a picture of me with Nate yesterday at the health center.
So now I'm pretty sure Vanessa thinks that something more than a kiss happened between me and Serena.
Well, did it? No, no, and I've told her that a hundred times.
But she slept in the other room last night, and when I woke up, she wasn't there.
What? I-I mean, I thought you'd be glad that I was sharing with you.
I am.
I am.
But you're not gonna like what I have to say.
Serena is a formidable woman, and what you guys shared was a big love.
You can't blame Vanessa for being insecure.
So if you wanna be with her, you need to show her that she doesn't have anything to be worried about.
I've told her that, but I'm not gonna stop talking to Serena, cut her out of my life.
All I'm saying is, at least for right now, Vanessa needs to know that she's the only one you care about.
I need to talk to you.
Oh, I'm in a hurry.
Now's not a good time.
You need to tell me what happened between you and Dan that night.
Isn't that a conversation you should be having with him? I did, but I can't trust him when it comes to you.
What's that supposed to mean? Let's just say it wouldn't be the first time a guy had lied to his girlfriend to cover up a night spent with you.
You know, Vanessa, you always wanna believe the worst in people.
Why change now? Exactly.
Glad to see you took me up on my offer.
I hope you like my signature martinis.
I'm tired of making dossiers and carrying cherry pies.
This would be good practice if I ever decide to take Blair down myself.
Well, don't get ahead of yourself, but I appreciate the enthusiasm.
What did you find out? Hi.
I just got your text.
What's up? Yeah, I just found out that test results could take three or four days to get back.
Wow.
Yeah.
Three or four days.
I can't believe our night's being derailed by this.
Unless There's another way that we can know for sure.
I mean, Serena must've talked or e-mailed someone about whether the rumors were true or not.
I guess I could talk to Blair.
Yeah.
She'd probably take the fifth.
How else are we gonna find out? No.
Forget it.
I just think the anticipation is making me crazy.
Well, I'm gonna go home.
We should both get ready.
And I am gonna start By taking a cold shower.
Bye.
I think we're ready.
You think? Oh, I can't just come out and ask him to steal Serena's phone.
But trust me, he's right where we need him to be.
Good.
If anything goes wrong, it'll be on him.
Right.
Just like we planned.
I have to go.
Vanessa.
What are you doing up here? I think Dan and Serena slept together last spring when we were still going out.
Oh, my God.
Are you sure? No.
That's the problem. They both deny it.
I'm sorry to unload on you like this. I'm just I feel like I'm losing my mind.
Well, then you have to find out for sure.
How?
I think I might have an idea.
That is, of course, if you're up for it.
Yeah.
Right now I'm up for anything, believe me.
Then call Dan. Tell him that you wanna talk and we'll meet him and Nate at Hamilton house tonight.
Are you sure?
Trust me.
Things have a way of working out when you least expect it.
Where have you been?
I know I'm late.
Again.
So I take it the meeting with your Professor did not go well.
It didn't go at all.
I didn't make it.
You know there's a clock on your cell phone, right? Yes.
Yes, but it wasn't my fault, but I e-mailed him and begged for five minutes of his time tonight.
Then we settle all Columbia business tonight.
And it just so happens that Ms.
Chamberlin b.
, can I just wish you good luck and take plausible deniability on this one? Luck not needed, but right back at ya.
You're a natural.
I said Serena forgot something.
One smile at the coat check guy and he handed it right over.
Now check her e-mail.
If Serena and Dan slept together, there's bound to be a message about the rumor.
This feels very wrong.
It's the only way you'll know for sure.
There's an e-mail from Dan a few hours ago.
What? "If Vanessa thinks "something more than a kiss happened between us "even though it didn't, I need to show her I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make things work.
" Well, now you have your answer.
We have to put this back right now.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
My boyfriend dated her, too.
You're not the only one with Serena insecurity.
Okay, well, then hurry up.
Shoot.
I think someone's coming.
Coast is clear.
Well? Nothing, thank God.
Come on.
Let's get outta here.
Okay, wait.
I told Dan that I needed to talk.
What what do I say now? He's a guy.
Do you think he really wants to talk? Just take him home and show him you're ready to move on.
Twice if necessary.
Thank you.
Nate's a lucky guy.
You guys make a really good couple.
Yeah, we do, don't we? Pardon the interruption, but you have an important call.
Blair Waldorf.
I'm Ms.
Chamberlin's new assistant.
Confident, I see.
When destiny calls? Always.
Especially when it arrives right on time.
Nothing says "soul mate" like punctuality.
Hey, Vanessa.
Dan.
Nate, um, Juliet's looking for you.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey.
What's going on? What do you mean? I just mean, like, why are you - why are you smiling so much? I'm just I'm - I'm glad to see you.
I thought I thought you were mad at me.
I'm I'm confused here.
Okay, wait a second.
Now now now I'm really confused.
You you said we needed to talk.
We already did.
I just I wasn't listening.
What do you say we get out of here? And I'll show you how much we don't need to talk.
I don't know.
I mean I'm pretty stubborn.
It might take all night.
Well, then I guess you'll need your strength.
Let's load up on free appetizers before we leave.
Hamilton house is where dreams come true.
On that we agree.
There.
Shall we? Beautiful scarf.
Oh, well, as we work together, you'll come to find that your tastes are my tastes.
Guess who.
Sam.
Hi.
I must say, Blair did not do you justice.
I know the feeling.
You thought this was my special someone? No.
I mean, unless What? Since I'm a powerful career-driven woman who intimidates men, I must be a lesbian? No.
This was not the date I set up.
He was an intellectual property lawyer who does pro Bono work helping kids sue Hollywood for stealing their Twitter ideas.
Then I suggest you see if he needs an assistant.
My class is full forever.
Great scarf, by the way.
Dean Reuther, Serena Van Der Woodsen.
Professor Lawford, I'm so sorry I didn't make our meeting this morning.
But as I mentioned in my e-mail, I'm hoping to impress upon you upon both of you that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to succeed at this school.
Yes, the e-mail that you sent to Professor Lawford makes that pretty clear.
I'm sorry? Perhaps we should have this conversation in private.
And what conversation would that be? The one regarding your e-mail that offers s*x for grades.
What? I-I-I didn't do that.
I would never do that.
This is your e-mail address, is it not? Yes, but I-I didn't send this.
Ms.
Van Der Woodsen, obviously we pay no mind to childish rumors that circulate all college campuses, but this e-mail is extremely serious.
The consequence of sending it, I'm afraid, is expulsion.
Expulsion? Spotted Serena Van Der Woodsen looking like she's hot for teacher.
That's the thing about a good gaslight with enough smoke, who cares if there's really a fire? Did you send that e-mail, the one that came from Serena's phone offering s*x to her Professor? What? Why would I do that? If you ask me, it sounds like an idea that Serena would get all on her own.
I don't think she would do that.
I'm gonna tell her we had her phone.
Wait.
Don't.
Maybe if we had access to it, then somebody else did as well.
I didn't send that e-mail.
But if you tell her that we took her phone, she is gonna blame us, and I could get expelled.
And so could she.
If you didn't send it, then you have nothing to worry about.
Where is Martha's date?! Penthouse suite at the empire with a woman I assure you he won't want to leave until morning, maybe afternoon.
Depends on his cardio.
I was going to play nice.
You think I don't have a plan "b"? Plan "b"? What could be more cunning and devious than date night? I had Dorota get chummy with Martha's maid, who came over from one of her sweatshops in the Philippines.
If I have to, I'll blackmail her for the position.
An illegal maid scandal? Nobody's cared about those in years.
And a lesbian switcheroo doesn't make you Blackwater.
The switcheroo was for fun.
The I.R.S.
Agent standing by to crawl up Martha's audit is not.
A tax fraud setup? They give away girl scout badges for that.
I have her prenup.
It has details.
I have the nanny.
She has pictures.
Martha's ex is in them.
So is Martha.
It turns out it was a threesome until the nanny turned it into a twosome.
Oh, my God! You students are psychotic.
I have better things to do with my time.
Tell the dean I quit.
Shame.
Sounded like a great class.
If you'll excuse me, I've heard good things about the make-your-own-pizza bar.
My phone isn't in here.
Whoever stole it must've been the person that sent the e-mail.
A missing cell phone is hardly proof.
I'll see you in my office on Monday, and we'll talk about what's next.
Good night, Jim.
Please don't do this.
You don't go to Columbia.
They can't do anything to you.
I'm sorry, but it's the right thing to do.
Wait.
Serena Call your phone.
Maybe the person who stole it might still be here.
Hey.
Hey, what's going on? Vanessa stole my phone and sent an e-mail to my Professor.
That's that's crazy.
Really? Do you wanna answer that? I'll speak with you later.
I can explain.
You took Serena's phone? She thinks we slept together.
Wait, you were the one behind the "Gossip Girl" rumor.
What? No! I-I know how this looks, but I did not send out that e-mail.
Juliet did.
She's the one who wanted to steal your phone in the first place.
W are you kidding me?! There is no way that I'm getting dragged into this.
I wasn't gonna say anything, but Vanessa came to me today.
She asked me to help her get revenge, and I told her no.
That is a lie! No, it's not.
Juliet told me before the party.
She was hoping to talk to Vanessa and calm her down.
But I'm sorry, man.
Wait, is that why you were so happy earlier and you wanted to get outta here? Yeah, with my phone, so that she could get rid of the evidence and make sure I was expelled.
I did not do this.
After everything we've been through, I'm asking you to please believe me.
I don't know what to believe right now.
Vanessa don't.
I'm sorry, okay? I-I wanted to be friends, but what did you expect me to do? I had to protect myself.
You're right.
You do.
Poor v.
Didn't she know that in love and war, a friend in need is willing to do most any deed? I believe you didn't send that e-mail, but I can't ignore the level of drama that has followed you to my campus and grown even louder since you arrived.
Meaning? Women of my generation had to fight for every opportunity and to be taken seriously, and your attitude, Ms.
Van Der Woodsen, makes a mockery of that.
If I were you, I would rethink my priorities.
Good night.
Ms.
Waldorf, I have my eye on you as well.
Plausible deniability was a good call.
And speaking of denials, you've been cleared in the court of public opinion.
Gossip Girl sent out an official retraction and personal apology to you about the rumor.
Not to mention, she said whatever person sent it is now on her hit list.
Yeah, well, it was Vanessa.
Vanessa? Yeah, well, Gossip Girl's scorn will only increase her social standing.
How did you figure it out? Uh, ironically, it was Juliet who I have to thank for that.
If you'll excuse me.
I was just telling Blair I have you to thank for clearing my name.
I know we got off on the wrong foot, but It's just because I was jealous of how much you meant to Nate, and I'm sorry.
Well Boys will do it almost every time.
Now if they weren't so darn cute Are you sure you're gonna be okay? Yeah.
Do you maybe wanna grab a drink with us? Uh, no.
I actually just wanna get outta here.
I'll see you in class.
Yeah.
Don't be late.
What are you still doing here? I lost the assistant position.
The entire faculty thinks I'm just as crazy as you.
You've made your point.
Can't you take your little celebration elsewhere? If you think I'd take tonight as some sort of balancing of the scales, I don't.
I'm not trying to make a point, Blair.
This is just a warm-up.
Whatever you want, wherever you want it, I am going to be there to take it away from you.
I won't stop until you have nothing.
You wouldn't go that far.
Who knows my limits since you took away my future? That wasn't your future.
That was Henry prince's.
Destroying me won't make you happy.
Happier.
The only thing that will make you happy, you lost the moment you slept with Jenny Humphrey.
And that was the best thing that ever happened to me, because I got over you forever.
If that's the truth, then why haven't you told anyone about Jenny? Not your family, not your minions, not Gossip Girl.
I know you're not keeping that secret to protect me.
You wouldn't.
That revelation would result in mutual destruction.
You may be homicidal, but you're not suicidal.
A man with nothing to live for is capable of anything.
I'm gonna stay with my parents for a little while.
That's that's probably a good idea.
I think I could use some time alone, too.
Dan, it's really important to me that you know I didn't start any rumors or send out that e-mail.
I-I believe you, I think.
But it doesn't change the fact that you didn't believe me.
I know that now.
It's just too bad that it took losing you to figure it out.
The red snapper.
Excellent choice.
What do you think? I think it's a bloody Mary with an inferiority complex.
Fair enough.
So Drinking alone, are we? You've made it pretty clear you're out of my league.
What do you have to lose by answering? I'd prefer not to encourage this kind of behavior.
Tell you what.
One drink, one question.
Tell me why you're drinking alone, and I'll tell you anything you want.
I thought I could start over, but it turns out college is just high school with more expensive books.
There's no starting over.
No matter where I go, whatever I do, my past seems to follow me.
So What about you? Why are you with a different girl every night? Because I stopped apologizing for my past a long time ago.
Does that really work? Does that actually make you happy? It did.
* Poppin' bottles in the ice * * Like a blizzard * The law of affinity refers to unlikely compositions forming a bond through a purely chemical reaction.
?Now I'm feeling so ? why didn't you stick to the plan? Like I said the first time, I thought Vanessa was the better option.
Well, she wasn't.
Serena didn't get expelled.
But now I'm in with Serena, and I can become her confidant and find something even bigger to take her down with.
Good, 'cause now you have no choice.
And I'd better not find out that this was about protecting Nate.
If you're falling for him I'm not.
I swear.
* G-get them bottles poppin' * I guess I have to trust you.
* Now get me two more bottles * Yeah, I guess you do.
** But even the strongest bonds have their limits * Actin' like they drunk * When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk? * Poppin' bottles in the ice * and when broken * When we drink, we do it right, Gettin' slizzard * * Sippin' sizzurp in my ride in my ride like three 6 * * Now I'm feeling so fly like a g6 * That 808 bump make you put your hands up? You sure about this? Mm-hmm.
Now that we know Vanessa was behind the rumors Absolutely.
That if left unchecked explode like a nuclear bomb.
Veronica, do you still work with Tim Gunn? I need to get an interview for someone who will be applying to Parsons.
Perfect.
Yeah, her name's Jenny Humphrey.
Thanks.
Waiting for the fallout.

Gossip Girl here.
Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of the Manhattan's elite.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you kidding me? Hey, you again.
Tell me why you're drinking alone, and I'll you anything you want.
I thought I could start over, but it turns out college is just high school with more expensive books.
Now I'm in with Serena, and I can find something even bigger to take her down with.
I better not find out that this was about protecting Nate.
If you're falling for him I'm not.
You sure about this? The Captain is being charged with embezzlement and fraud.
There's a different way to get our lives back, dad, one that doesn't require another felony.
You be a man and you turn yourself in.
The moment you slept with Jenny Humphrey that was the best thing that ever happened to me because I got over you.
If that's the truth, then why haven't you told anyone about Jenny? You wouldn't.
I need to get an interview for someone who will be applying to Parsons.
Her name's Jenny Humphrey.
and who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

Hello? Somebody there? Who's there? ? 38 00:01: 00:01:48,607 I know it's you, Chuck! Aah! Help! Somebody help! They say waking up is hard to do Especially when you're not alone.

No shame.
For your information, we just stayed up talking all night.
Oh.
So does this chatty insomniac have a name? Colin.
The cab stealer.
Oh, well, you showed him.
It turns out he actually has some redeeming qualities.
He's handsome in an old Hollywood way.
He's smart.
And even though he's a businessman, he's more interested in talking about Lichtenstein and Warhol, which he collects, by the way.
So what are you doing here? He also collects women that he puts into cabs a new one each morning and I'm not gonna be one of them.
I won't be.
What's wrong with you? You look exhausted.
Ugh.
I had another Chuck nightmare.
It was awful.
I was in "wait until dark.
" And I knew that he was there, just lying in wait like in real life.
But then when he attacked me, he turned out to be a she.
Like Chuck in drag or an actual girl? I don't know! I was blind.
Well, it makes sense you're dreaming about being attacked ever since Chuck declared war.
I guess.
But then why a girl? And that hair so long and B.
, hey, can we talk about this on our way to school? Without the cab stealer, I have no excuse for being late for a class, and I promised the dean I'd be a model student.
Uh, I'm gonna meet you there.
There's something I need to do first.
Okay.
Hey, man.
What are you doing up so early? Oh, just visiting my dad.
Thought I'd check in.
You okay? Yeah, well, Vanessa went to stay with her folks for a while so Sorry, man.
Probably for the best, though, right? Yeah, I suppose.
I guess part of her just believes that I'll always be in love with Serena no matter what I say.
Yeah.
Crazy.
So, uh, what about you? How was your big night with Juliet? Totally worth the wait.
At least I thought so.
Huh? What do you mean? This morning, she bolted.
She said she couldn't skip class.
So? So I thought she'd want to hang.
You know, maybe have breakfast at Tom's, stay in bed all day.
I don't know.
Right, well, I'm gonna ignore the fact that you have the best problems ever, and tell you just not to read too much into it.
I know this might come as a shock, but maybe she didn't want to skip class.
All right.
I gotta go.
Talk to you later.
Juliet? Nate? Hey.
Oh, so the campus crusade continues? You haven't punished Blair enough for driving Eva away? As I told her, I've hardly begun.
Besides, I actually like it here.
Chuck.
From what I hear, they've got someone big to replace Martha for the psychology of business lecture.
Apparently, he's fortune 500.
I'm curious to meet the man, see what lessons there are to be learned.
Speaking of, where's Blair? Don't tell me she threw in the towel after just one round? She'll be here.
Uh, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to sit with them.
From what I hear, badminton players know how to handle a shuttlecock.
Hold the door, please.
Colin.
Hey.
What are you doing here? This is psychology of business, right? Yeah, but Oh, no.
Don't tell me you're The new professor.
I take it from your less than glowing enthusiasm that you are now one of my Students.
Yes.
They say life is full of surprises, that our dreams really can come true.
Hello? Then again, so can our nightmares.
Anybody there? Welcome home, Jenny Humphrey.
We've missed you.
Blair, whatever you're about to do, my dad and lily are gonna be home any minute.
Not to worry, Little J.
This is going to be a very short conversation.
I let you walk away after you whored yourself out to Chuck because I assumed you were smart enough never to come back.
I might've been willing to make exceptions for holidays, birthdays, health emergencies of immediate family members, but I don't believe any of those scenarios apply.
Blair, I'm just here for one day.
I have an interview with Tim Gunn, and if everything goes well, then he'll write me a recommendation letter for Parsons.
Parsons is still in Manhattan, is it not? Lower Manhattan.
It's a hundred blocks away from the Upper East Side semantics.
You were banished.
If people think I'm not a woman of my word, the whole system could break down.
Look, Blair, I'm not looking to destabilize your social order.
You know how much fashion means to me, and Parsons is the school for it.
I'll call you a car to take you back to Hudson and wait while you pack.
How about a day pass? I promise I'll leave directly after my interview.
And, you know, who knows if Tim Gunn's even gonna like my work? But either way, I promise I won't set foot in Manhattan for the rest of the year, not even Christmas.
Jenny-free holiday season.
It's been on my wish list for quite some time.
Amnesty till midnight.
Thank you.
I'm not done.
There are terms.
See no one, speak to no one, and don't step foot outside this apartment except for your interview.
Fine.
Good-bye, Little J.
I look forward to never seeing you again.
So Running into each other at a prison.
That's kind of awkward.
Yeah, especially because you said you were going to class.
Were you following me or something? No.
No, I wasn't following you, okay? I'm visiting my dad.
He's in for fraud and embezzlement.
He just got transferred down from upstate.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you tell me? Well, it's usually not a part of my "a" game pillow talk.
I mean, it was in all the papers.
I thought you might know, and and I wouldn't have to talk about it.
No, I-I didn't.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't living in the city then.
No, it's okay.
It's nice to actually have someone to talk to who might understand.
So who are you here for? Your brother you were telling me about? No.
I'm a volunteer For the prison literacy program.
Why didn't you just tell me that this morning? Look, all I wanted to do was stay in bed with you, and I don't know.
I guess I just felt weird bailing on you for some convicts.
Like you said, not exactly the best pillow talk.
Well, I think it's great you do something like that.
All right, I gotta get going before my dad wonders where I am.
But, um, is it cool if I swing by later, check out your class? Oh, no.
Um I just got a text message saying that my session was canceled.
I'll see you back in the city? Okay.
Hey.
You are never going to believe who's back in town.
What's wrong? Our new psychology of business professor is Colin, the guy from last night.
Cab guy? What are the odds? I can't believe this is happening.
I'm already on thin ice with the dean.
What am I supposed to do? Nothing.
You make sure that he knows that there will be no more cuddling or art talk and that you expect to be treated exactly the same as if the two of you had never met.
I really like him, though.
But I'll talk to him.
Office hours! Not his apartment! Bye.
Bye.
Did you happen to know that Jenny Humphrey was back on my island? Really? She must have a lot of nerve, considering you banned her from the city.
If people found out she defied you they won't.
And let me remind you, I sent her packing for both of our sakes.
If it was ever made public that you had a dangerous liaison with a teenage Brooklynite who also technically is your stepsister, you'd be socially guillotined.
Well, I'd be mad to have anything to do with her return then, wouldn't I? Arthur, pull the car around.
It's time to make the stop I requested.
Reporting for duty! I need you three little pigs to huff and puff over to the Van Der Woodsens'.
You're on stakeout.
Jenny Humphrey is back.
She's violating your order to exile? I gave her a day pass, but she is not to move one inch outside that building without me knowing.
Got it? Nothing could be more entertaining than bottle blonde recon.
But we'll still dying to know why you deported Jenny in the first place.
Yours is not to wonder why.
Yours is to do or die.
Go! I can't believe I didn't know you were coming back.
Well, I'm only here for a day.
I didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
If dad put out a spread like this every time you came home, I'd be inviting you more often.
Thanks? Well, these are so lovely.
I can see why Tim Gunn is dying to meet with you.
Are you kidding? He knows what I do.
Parsons would be lucky to have her.
Hey, how about, uh, dinner at Babbo tonight, celebrate us all being back together? Um, I'd actually kinda rather stay in, if that's okay.
Um, dad's chili? What? When have you ever passed up Babbo? Yeah, I know, but I have a, um, a couple finishing touches to do on my dresses, so if you guys will excuse me I'm sorry, Rufus, but the chili the smell, it lingers.
What? Must be the cumin.
Okay, so what's really going on? Well, Blair stopped by with her welcome wagon.
I don't know why I thought I could sneak back in for a day, but Well, how did she know you were here before I did? She's the wicked witch of the Upper East Side.
You know, I'm sure one of her monkeys spotted me getting off the train or something.
But it's fine.
She's giving me a day pass as long as I don't see or talk to anyone.
That's ridiculous.
Yeah, it is 100% vintage crazy-ass Blair.
But really, though, I mean, I have no interest in going back to being g.
I.
Jenny and warring with Blair.
How very Gandhi of you.
But in case eastern philosophy does fail you, how about I meet you downtown after my class and I can escort you back up here? Thanks, but really, the only person I have to worry about today is Tim Gunn.
Hello? Is anybody home? Chuck.
It's all right.
I'll deal with him.
What are you doing here, Chuck? Oh.
I heard Jenny was back.
I wanted to speak with her.
And say what? "I'm sorry for taking advantage of you "and letting my psycho ex-girlfriend run you out of town"? Something like that, except without the sarcasm.
Yeah, well, I think I can deliver that message, and I think you can find the elevator.
Oh, how can I argue with Big Brother? I'll just grab these blueprints lily left for me.
I'll let you get back to your Hemingway complex.
You know, I almost respect this side to you, Humphrey.
Tell Jenny I said hello, and I'm truly sorry.
Hey.
Oh.
You raced out of class pretty fast.
Was I that boring? Come to think of it, you raced off pretty fast this morning as well.
Well, I know the routine.
I wanted to save you the effort of walking me out and hailing me a cab.
Does that mean you think last night was a mistake? The opposite, actually.
I had a lot of fun last night, which is why I didn't want you to think I was one of your usual conquests.
You made that pretty clear last night when you declined to be conquered.
All of this, however, was before I found out you were my professor.
And relationships with faculty are strictly forbidden, and I-I don't want last night to affect how you treat me as a student.
I've gotta say, that didn't sound very heartfelt.
Wanna try it again with a little more conviction? I've said what I needed to say.
You can have the t.
A.
Mark my papers.
May I offer a counterproposal? I have to go to this party tonight for "the New York observer.
" I'm getting some kind of eligible bachelor award.
Will you come with me? Wouldn't bringing a date make you ineligible for an award like that? Maybe having you on my arm would be honor enough.
If I give up my bachelor title and commit to getting to know you better, maybe you could put off mastering the psychology of business for another semester? Well, it's not like business is my major.
And it's still the add/drop period, so I'll pick you up.
The messenger's picking them up so that the models can get fitted, okay? Of course.
I tell him extra careful, special delivery.
All right.
Thanks, Vanya.
Why are you calling me? I understand your reluctance to ever speak to me again.
And I don't wanna bother you.
I was picking up some Bass Industries blueprints earlier, and it seems I mistakenly took your portfolio.
Chuck, I don't know what type of game you're playing, but my interview's in an hour.
You have to bring it back right now.
I would, of course, but I'm heading into a meeting I can't reschedule.
Can you swing by the empire? No! I'm not supposed to go anywhere but my interview, and I definitely can't see you.
So you won't have to.
I left it at the front desk with my concierge.
Good luck today.
No, Chuck! * She was made to blow you away * * She don't care * * What any man say * Spotted B.
's disciples hot on Little J.
's tail.
* But keep your mouth shut * * Or it's * Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! This is fun.
And hopefully it's about to get more so.
* Well, now she's long * Follow that cab! * Long gone * Don't tell me you lost her.
Watch out, J.
break a deal with the devil We didn't.
She just walked into the empire.
* She's long gone like Moses through the corn * I need the address of Tim Gunn's studio.
And there will be hell to pay.
Dan, you didn't have to meet me here.
Besides, I'm already late.
I was in the neighborhood.
But this is Veronica, and she was out here waiting for you.
Oh, sorry.
Hi.
I'm Jenny Humphrey.
I had a couple last-minute organizational issues.
No problem, Jenny.
But the models are already inside getting dressed, and Mr.
Gunn is on a very tight schedule today.
Uh, wish me luck? I don't have to.
I mean, admittedly, you're my sister, and I love you, so I'm biased.
But if you can take Blair in stride today, Tim Gunn will be a piece of cake.
Don't tell him I said that.
Okay.
Thank you.
All right.
I'll be out here waitin' for ya.
Collect call from a correctional facility.
Do you accept these charges? Yes.
Ben, I'm so glad you called.
Where were you today? I came, but Nate I thought I told you to stop seeing him.
His father's in prison with you.
What? Don't they make you do your homework at Columbia? I did, but he just transferred, and I bumped into Nate outside.
Don't worry.
I made something up.
You're wrong about him, you know.
I mean, we we talked.
And he's not like the others.
He might actually understand.
Understand what exactly? That your Big Brother's in prison? Maybe.
But what happens when he starts asking questions about why? You think he's gonna understand then? I don't know.
I just I don't want to lie to him anymore.
Maybe you're right.
I've put a lot on you.
You're my little sister.
You deserve to be happy.
Thank you For understanding.
All right, I've gotta get back, but I'll call you later.
Hey, you know a new guy in here, last name Archibald? Introduce me?
Hey, mom.
Serena! What a lovely surprise.
What brings you back to the homestead? Don't tell me word reached you that Rufus is making his famous chili.
Jenny's in town.
Hmm.
Guess she forgot to call.
Well, I know you two haven't exactly been the best of friends in the past, but maybe that can change now that you've had some time apart.
Well, as much as I would love to bond with her, I actually have plans special plans that involve me raiding my mother's jewelry box.
Those are special plans.
Well, let's see what we can do.
Oh.
Hey, what are you reading? Oh, it's just a book by one of my professors.
But I'm "Winner!" By Colin Forrester.
"A must-read for 21st century C.
E.
O.
S.
" Serena, I can't tell you how happy it makes me to see you taking such a challenging course just right out of the gate.
Honestly, after the year that you've had, it's wonderful to see you thinking about your future instead of focusing on boys.
Thanks, mom.
Mm.
All right, let's go find something that sparkles, huh? Especially for someone so young.
Oh, thank you.
I yeah, fashion's pretty much the only thing I've ever cared about.
So you interned with Eleanor Waldorf.
Love her.
Then you left to start your own line.
That was bold.
Yeah, in retrospect, it was probably a little too bold.
I didn't exactly leave on great terms, and then my new business partner set all of my dresses on fire, so Oh, my.
But you must've patched things up with Eleanor because I see you worked together again last year.
And then you just left town? Uh Well, there was a-a conflict with a different Waldorf.
But I can assure you that all of that's behind me now.
I think that these dresses really express my take on young women today our sense of self-confidence and self-worth.
Well, let's take a look.
Okay.
This is quite a statement, Jenny.
Um, no we're done.
Uh, that part is not let's get ready for the next appointment.
Uh, no, I'm confidence and self-worth? I don't know if this is your idea of a joke, but it's not funny.
It's not a joke.
I'm so sorry.
This isn't how I'll show you the way out.
Mr.
Gunn, please ladies, you may leave.
Blair, uh, I don't know what you're doing here, but whatever it is, it's not gonna work, 'cause Jenny's already inside.
Oh.
I came for the after party.
Blair! How could you?! Jenny, wait.
What what happened? She totally humiliated me and destroyed my collection.
You broke the terms of our agreement.
Here.
There's a 5:00.
Spotted Little J.
having a fashion emergency.
Looks like B.
drew blood.
Chuck.
Before you say anything, I'm only calling because I saw "Gossip Girl.
" I wondered if I might be able to offer some assistance.
Well, unless it's a murder-suicide, I think I'll pass.
So dramatic.
You should be a writer.
Tim Gunn is being honored at "The Observer's" new yorkers of the year party tonight at the boom boom room.
Why don't you two accompany me? Surely Jenny can find a quiet moment to plead her case.
And why should I actually believe that you're trying to help us here? It would be my way of making amends to Jenny.
Why don't you run it by the brains of the operation? I can't imagine her wanting Blair to win this one.
Chuck can get us into "the observer" party, and Tim Gunn's gonna be there.
Well, it's not like Blair can do anything worse to me.
But what about dinner with dad? Tell your sister I'll leave tickets for the whole family.
I look forward to seeing you at the festivities.
Careful, Little J.
Queen B.
doesn't grant second chances.
She attacks at first sight.
You look incredible.
Thank you.
Maybe we should walk in separately.
You having second thoughts? No.
No, no.
I just I talked to my mom today, and she's so proud of me for taking your class.
I don't want her to read that I'm dropping it in "the New York times.
" Well, why don't you just tell her? Because she'll think I'm choosing a man over my future again.
You know what? If it's okay with you, I'm just gonna meet you upstairs.
Lily.
Ivanka.
Rufus.
Hey, Jared, great.
Good to see you.
You are a vision.
Oh, thank you both for coming.
Pleasure to be here.
Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean, r.
I.
S.
D.
Has a great fashion program.
We are not letting you give up on Parsons.
Come on.
I-I have a Blair-shaped target on my back.
Oh, you want to be Gandhi? Now's your chance.
Let's go find Tim Gunn.
Mom, hey! What are you doing here? Mmm.
What happened to chili night? Change of plan.
Uh, Dan and Jenny wanted to come, so we all did.
Great.
Is that your professor? Who? Colin Forrester.
I recognize him from his jacket photo which, incidentally, does not do him any justice.
One more, Colin.
Um, mom, about that I know, how important it is to you that I take his class oh, it's not the class I care about.
I am just so proud of the student you're becoming, your new focus.
I know, but just Serena, I ducked the press line.
Tell your mother that I am crazy about you, that I might be your future, and I don't care who knows.
Sorry.
Colin Forrester.
Lily Humphrey, formerly Van Der Woodsen.
Serena's mother Who heard everything loud and clear.
Status report.
Jenny didn't get on the train.
She's at "the observer" party.
We followed her here.
This isn't just belligerency.
It's insurgency.
Why would she risk escalating my wrath? Tim Gunn is here.
Of course.
An eleventh hour appeal.
Don't let her out of your sight.
I'm on my way.
Well, the boom boom room is a private club, and we're having trouble with the door guy.
Can you help? Penelope, this isn't congress.
Accomplish something.
Ladies.
Good to see you.
All on a go-see, see who you like, who you'd like to have through the line, and, um, if that works out for you, we could Mr.
Gunn? Hi.
Jenny Humphrey.
Jenny.
Of course.
Um, I'm I'm really sorry to bother you.
I just I didn't get a chance to explain earlier that my dresses weren't supposed to be like that, with the the paint and the letters.
Oh, dear.
What happened? I-it's a long story.
But, um, I just I really needed you to know that that's not who I am or what my work's about.
And I would really do anything for a second chance.
I think I can arrange for another interview.
And don't let your dresses out of your sight.
All right.
Thank you.
You know, when Veronica told me that Chuck Bass wanted us to meet wait.
Chuck called you? Really? No inmates by that name? All right.
Well, um, thank you.
Hey.
Hi.
What is it? I know this sounds a little crazy, but after our talk this morning, I thought maybe your brother was an inmate, and you were just too embarrassed to tell me, so I called over there.
You called the prison? Yeah, and I'm sorry.
I was just being paranoid, and it's not an excuse, but I have a history of believing girls when I shouldn't.
I just wanna make sure we're totally open with each other.
I know.
I-I want the same thing.
In fact That's why I came over.
There are some things that I need to tell you about me, and and my family.
Wait one second.
It's the prison.
Hello? Yes.
Wait, wait.
What? Are you sure? Of course.
I'll come right over.
Is everything okay? No.
My dad's been jumped by some inmates, and he's in the infirmary.
Nate.
I gotta go.
I'll call you later, okay? Lily! Isaac! Hi! Mwah.
It is wonderful to see you.
So good to see you.
Of course you're being honored tonight.
Thank you.
Rufus, this is Isaac Mizrahi.
Hello, Isaac.
Hello.
Jenny, hey.
I saw you walk away from Tim Gunn.
What happened? Just like old times, huh, J.
? What are you guys doing here? Question is, what are you doing here? Or do you want that dress messed up, too? Leave me alone.
We don't make the rules, J.
We just enjoy enforcing them.
But there is one thing we don't understand what a pathetic nobody like you could've done to Blair Waldorf to get her so riled up we had to play follow the loser all day.
Wait.
You guys don't know why Blair hates me? Besides the obvious? No one does.
Blair's here.
You're in trouble now.
We'll see who's in trouble.
Jenny.
Jenny, whatever you're thinking of doing they won't stop.
Why should I? Move! I have a Humphrey to squash.
Looking to paint the town red? I don't know what you've heard, but it isn't your concern.
Unless It is.
You've been behind this the whole time, haven't you? You got Jenny the interview with Tim Gunn, and you made sure that your friend-with-no-benefits stopped by the empire just to defy me.
I told you I wouldn't rest until you were destroyed.
Inviting your old sparring partner back was just my way of avoiding doing all the dirty work myself.
Jenny always had a talent for making your life a living hell.
You've gone too far.
Bringing Jenny back puts both of our reputations at risk.
I love to watch you squirm.
The pleasure I get from witnessing your shame is considerable.
But I doubt Jenny will talk.
She thinks she's above it all, but little Humphrey still cares what people think.
Looks like New York's best kept secret is finally out.
Turns out Little J.
didn't lose her V.
card to Damien Dalgaard.
She waited and chucked it away with her stepbrother.
Guess that explains the Humphrey in Hudson.
Hell hath no fury like a Waldorf scorned.
It's obviously not true.
Jenny put out the blast so that She would humiliate me.
Tell them that she's lying.
Give it up, Blair.
Everyone knows I did and who I gave it to.
Looks like the joke's on Chuck and Blair, and Little J.
's got the last laugh.
Hey.
You okay? I'm not quite sure what just happened in there, but it it, uh, seems all bad.
It's a matter of degree.
I mean, I'm a little embarrassed that the entire world knows I lost it to Chuck Bass.
But did you see their faces? I mean, Blair looked like she might cry.
Well, so much for zen Jenny Humphrey.
Come on, Dan.
I just did what needed to be done.
It's what Blair and Chuck would've done.
Jen, I was proud of you for moving on, but if this is what you've become after just a day back, maybe Blair was right after all, and maybe you should go back to Hudson.
I met Colin before he started teaching, but I'm gonna drop his class Monday so there aren't any further problems.
Oh, Serena, please, you don't need to apologize.
I get it.
Wait.
You're not mad at me? Well, I understand the lure of a powerful man like Colin.
I married Bart Bass, remember? It's fine.
And to be honest, they can make your life so much easier.
Well, it's not about that.
Well, we both know you would have moved on to classes more your speed eventually.
You don't think I could've handled a business class? Well, we'll never know now, will we? Darling, I'm just trying to be supportive and realistic.
A pretty girl like you could get the attention of a Colin Forrester even without an education.
So why even bother? Lil, I think you may have taken this tough love a little too literally this time.
Well, um, after Serena left this afternoon, I bought Colin's book, and on chapter 16, it talks about reverse psychology.
Nothing I've done so far has gotten through, so I thought I'd try something new.
Oh.
Dad.
Nate.
Are you okay? What happened? No idea.
I was reading in the library one minute, and the next minute, somebody was taking batting practice with a dictionary.
Do you know who it was? Do you have a problem with someone? I've never seen 'em before.
Hey.
Are they giving you anything? No.
Don't worry.
I'm still on the wagon.
I told 'em nothing stronger than a Tylenol.
Did you let your mother know? Yeah.
I let her know.
I'm sure if she knew how bad it was, she would come down.
Nate, it's okay.
I gave up on your mother visiting a long time ago.
This wasn't exactly what she signed up for.
Yeah, well, whatever happened to "in good times and bad"? I don't know.
I spent most of our marriage focused on "for richer or poorer.
" I just wish she could see how great you're doing now Present situation excluded.
Now you can see it.
That's enough for now.
Nothing I can do about the rest till I get parole.
Well, just try and stay safe until then.
You know, no reading.
Tell me again about that girl you like.
Thank you, Jared, and thank you, Ivanka, for marrying Jared and giving someone else the chance to win "bachelor" this year.
This is quite an honor, but one I would gladly give up for the right woman Mom, let's go.
If I'm ever lucky enough to meet her.
Anyway, um, thank you all Are you happy now that you've humiliated both of us? Check your own bloody hands, lady MacBeth.
What did you think would happen when you played "Carrie" with her dresses? I only did it because you lured her back here to torture me.
I warned you I wouldn't stop.
And thanks to your vendetta, we both lost, and Jenny Humphrey won.
If you've come to gloat, I would relish the moment.
It will be fleeting.
You're right, because I'm leaving.
Despite what happened today, I can't beat you.
In order to beat you, I'd have to become you, and I'm better than that.
At least I wanna be.
Nice try, Jenny.
We know that you're just scared and trying to save face.
You two used to be in love, and together you were invincible.
But now that you've turned against each other, it's just a matter of time before your mutual destruction.
And when that happens, maybe I'll think about coming home, but for now, good-bye, good riddance, and good luck.
We hear Little J.
Gave Chuck and Blair a good-bye kiss Of death.
Come in.
Hello? Hey, what are you doing here? I was just gonna leave a note under your door.
It explains everything.
Sorry.
I thought you'd be out celebrating your bachelorhood, putting a new girl into a cab.
Actually, I'm working on my lecture for Monday's class.
Really? You got me thinking, if my class is so important to you, maybe I should try a little harder to make it worth your while.
Fewer models and martinis, more footnotes and flowcharts.
I know you need to figure out what you wanna do with your life, Serena.
I've been there.
Believe me.
And if my course can help, that's great.
But it's only seven weeks.
Meaning? We can still get to know each other As teacher and student.
By the book? I'm willing to wait if you are.
Well then, teacher, I'll see you Monday.
And don't even think about leaving an apple on my desk.
You've got no shot at being teacher's pet.
Seriously, Dan, you don't have to ride with me all the way to the border.
Pretty sure I'm safe now.
Besides, I'm leaving, like Blair wanted.
No, no, I'm not guarding you.
I'm just, uh, just hanging out.
I'm really proud of you, Jen.
Thanks.
Although I don't know if I'm ever gonna be able to come back to the Upper East Side without morphing into everything I hate about myself.
Oh, give it some time.
Let your Brooklyn D.
N.
A.
guide you to righteousness.
Well, if it's your D.
N.
A.
that I share, then maybe I have a chance.
Yeah.
Thanks for being a good brother.
They say war's not the answer.
But sometimes it's a battle just to keep the peace.
If you're here to deliver any further humiliation, Dorota can sign for it.
Jenny was right.
If we keep going, we both end up dead, and I like myself too much to let that happen.
I assume you feel the same.
About myself? More.
What do you suggest? A truce.
Why don't you just skywrite the word "double-cross"? It'd be more subtle.
Look, we can keep blaming each other for what happened that night, or we can admit a harder truth it was no one's fault.
It was fate.
Tragedy.
If Serena hadn't kissed Dan, then Nate wouldn't have been at the hospital looking for her, and Jenny wouldn't have come looking for Nate.
If Dorota hadn't gone into labor Maybe everything would be different.
But it's not.
We're holding on to the pain because it's all we have left.
But we don't have to.
We have a choice.
Truce.
You can see yourself out.
I know the way.
* Just gonna stand there and hear me cry * * But that's all right * * because I love the way you lie * * I love the way you lie * * I can't tell you what it really is * * I can only tell you what it feels like, and right now * On the Upper East Side, you may stand down, but you can never give up.
And the bitterest feuds are always labors of love.
Hi.
Hi.
I just got home.
Can you come over? I don't think so.
My dad's gonna be okay.
Thanks for asking.
I'm glad, but, Nate But what? Oh, God, this is so hard.
Okay, well, let me make it easy for you.
You find out that Nate Archibald's dad's a jailbird, and you decide you can do better, or maybe you already have.
Nate, please, you're different than anyone I've ever known.
No, you know what? Just save it, okay? 'Cause you're exactly like everyone I've ever known.
I'm so sorry, but I have to go.
* Just gonna stand there and* Hey, Juliet.
* And hear me cry * What's wrong? Nothing.
I'm fine.
Just a bad day.
I I hope it's okay I poured myself a drink.
Of course.
I could use one, too.
* I love the way you lie * I assume you are here for your check and not just to raid my liquor cabinet.
I'm sorry to be so predictable.
* And we fall back into the same patterns * * Same routine * Here.
This should cover things.
* When it comes to love, you're just as blinded * * Baby, please come back * How's it going? You weren't kidding when you said it'd be a challenge.
Well, all good things are worth waiting for, aren't they? But our most dangerous enemies are the ones we never knew we had.
To patience.
* In my voice when I talk * * Gonna stand there and * So if you want peace, always be prepared for war.

, Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here.
Your one and only source in the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
You two used to be in love.
Together, you were invincible.
But now that you've turned against each other, it's just a matter of time before your mutual destruction.
Truce? Now I'm in with Serena, and I can find something even bigger to take her down with.
Ben's not my boyfriend.
Please, you're different than anyone I've even known.
Just save it, okay? 'Cause you're exactly like everyone I've ever known.
All good things are worth waiting for, aren't they? Our new psychology of business professor is Colin, the guy from last night.
Cab guy? What are the odds? Relationships with faculty are strictly forbidden.
I'm willing to wait if you are.
Well, then, teacher, I'll see you Monday.
Rise and shine, Upper East Siders.
It's officially fall.
And when the leaves start to turn, we know it's time for B.
's birthday.
We hope Serena will be there to celebrate, but we hear she's having her own private party with a professor.
So you're from Maine? I grew up on a boat.
Not a yacht.
A trawler.
My family's in lobsters.
I love "The Deadliest Catch.
" Okay, so how did you get from there to here? Yeah, it was all my dad.
He never graduated high school, so he made sure I didn't make the same mistake.
And the rest of your family? Still adrift, in more ways than one.
Do I sense a little mystery there? So you came from nothing and now here you are this big finance guy traveling the world with a killer art collection.
Favorite book? "Mergers, acquisitions, and corporate restructurings.
" Really? You just became my next project.
Tomorrow, we'll have a music and most embarrassing moments.
Unless We can do this, Serena.
Six more weeks.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Happy to have you home, miss Eleanor.
You didn't think I would miss throwing my only child a 20th birthday party? Mother, you do know that my actual birthday isn't until next week, don't you? I am not likely to forget.
Cyrus and I have tickets to the Palais Garnier.
So I thought, better an early birthday bash than a belated one.
It is a shame that the party will fall on the same night as Lily and Rufus' anniversary, but so goes event planning in Manhattan.
Cyrus sent you this present.
A signed copy of "This I Remember.
" What a fitting gift.
It is time that I claim my rightful role as power player on the world stage, just like little Nell did.
Tonight's party is going to be as glamorous and sophisticated as its guest of honor.
Mmm.
Dorota, come.
We have just enough time for a dramatic reading of page one before I have to meet Serena.
So you seem pretty eager to get together this morning.
What? Your your first anniversary's a big deal.
And I-I figured maybe you could use my help planning, and maybe I needed to get out of the house.
Vanessa just got back from the commune.
You guys talk? Oh, if saying "hey" and "excuse me" counts as talking.
Worst thing is, she she tried to get back into campus housing, but, uh, the deadline past.
Oh, so now you're roomies with your ex.
Yeah.
Hey, how would you and Lily feel about celebrating, uh, with a with a nice family road trip? Actually, uh, we decided to order in tonight and just have a quiet evening alone.
Oh, I-I thought you said, um, it's really important to celebrate with the whole family.
We did, but Jenny has a big test she has to study for and can't make it back to the city.
And it doesn't feel right having a family celebration without her.
I know the first wedding anniversary's supposed to be paper, but that's not really an excuse to to eat out of cartons.
We'll celebrate together some other time when Jenny's back home.
I'm gonna head off, find lil some flowers, try to make this special.
What class has a test on a Saturday? That would be fear of Chuck and Blair 101.
And after the year we've had, I think it would mean a lot to my dad and Lily to get the family together.
There's there's gotta be a way that we can get Jenny to come in, right? Maybe Chuck could help.
Right, like he did last time? He loves my mom, and as long as Chuck and Blair are at war, he's on our side.
Did you get a haircut? It looks different.
No, just happy, I guess.
Well, if I know you, there's a guy at the end of that story.
Well, I might be seeing someone kind of.
What is he doing here? What's she doing here? And who brought the avon lady? She's a court stenographer.
There's a notary on the way.
We've witnessed the Waldorf/Bass wars firsthand.
We know you both.
You have nuclear capability.
Sooner or later, one of you is gonna press the other's button, and we're gonna end up with nothing but cockroaches.
You know, we're way ahead of you.
Yeah, we're in a truce.
Which is why we figured you wouldn't have a problem making it official A peace treaty based on more than just a handshake.
So that's why we're gonna sit down and hammer out the provisions of a cease-fire.
And if either of you decide to break the treaty He or she will be excommunicated.
We'll no longer be your friends.
Well, I suppose as I leave my teens, that I should start to think about my legacy.
I have no objection to order in the kingdom.
Let the negotiations begin.
If you give me the standard on weeknights, I'll give you the Carlyle for the entire Christmas season.
Done, but I want an addendum that you can't bed hostesses from a roster of restaurants I frequent.
You can't have fashion week in both Paris and Milan.
You have to choose.
Never, but I will give you art basel in Miami and Switzerland.
Okay, moving on to article 47 Strip clubs in the outer boroughs.
Sidebar.
Why are we sidebar-ing? Do you really want access to strip clubs? No, I just don't want to seem like I'm ceding territory too easily.
So pretend like we're talking about something serious, like my birthday, or have you figured out that anniversary situation? B.
, what can I do? They're already planning a family thing.
Unacceptable Just like that s*x glow you're sporting.
There was no s*x.
Just coffee.
Coffee is the thing you have before you pay the check to go have s*x.
It's different.
Colin is Our professor? The one you promised to stay away from except where class is concerned? Which is why we're only meeting during office hours.
You are one macchiato away from making the same mistake that you always make, and I won't be an accomplice, especially not on my almost-birthday.
Okay, fine, then I won't mention him anymore.
I cede the strip clubs.
Ugh.
Then that concludes the treaty.
Actually, there's one more point I want to negotiate in private.
Attorneys, you're dismissed.
Well, I guess we know why Chuck didn't answer the phone.
Of course Chuck and Blair go to war and end up happier than ever, leaving Jenny and our family in a pile of rubble.
Yeah, it figures.
Rubble's their specialty.
Although peace time would be the perfect opportunity for a stealth strike.
Oh, come on.
How good would it feel to finally give them a taste of their own medicine? Not that we're the ones to give it to them.
Well, hold on a second.
What's wrong with us? I mean, I've picked up a-a few skills over the years, and you come from a long line of world-class schemers.
We have righteousness and our parents' anniversary on our side.
No offense, Dan, but we are no match for Chuck and Blair.
Mm, I don't know about that.
Seems like leaves aren't the only things changing colors this fall.
So that's it.
The war is over.
No more blackmail, angry asides, or sadistic schemes.
We're not a couple.
We're not at war.
We officially have no reason to interact beyond social niceties.
What a huge relief.
I guess this is good-bye.
Let us not forget article 19 No touching.
Take care, Chuck.
Serena! Oh, are you picking up something for Blair's birthday? A first edition? That's really thoughtful.
Actually, Blair's getting a special delivery from Bergdorf's.
This is for a professor.
That's an awfully nice gift for a professor.
You must really like his lectures.
Or that's not all you like.
I may have a small crush.
Tell me everything! I've been there myself, so no judgments, and my lips are sealed.
Well, nothing's happened, and nothing's going to happen At least, not while he's my teacher.
I would never put my academic future at risk.
Then what are you doing? Just talking, getting to know each other until the semester's over.
The waiting is Actually amazing.
Wow.
That's great.
Does he feel the same way? What do you mean? All books, no s*x? I-I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but he's a guy, and guys don't wait.
So if he's not getting it from you, then There's no way.
He's, um different.
Well, if not, I'm here for advice.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Bye.
Got it.
Its genius is in its simplicity.
We break the truce, drive a wedge between them.
Then once the peace is off, Chuck will be primed to help Jenny in retaliation.
Okay, so what would enrage Chuck Bass? His maybe mother? His late father? Jack Bass.
That's perfect.
Gossip Girl will be thrilled to hear about a secret fling with Jack and Blair last summer in the south of France, or how they're planning to do it again this Christmas.
Nice touch.
Are you sure we aren't really related? All right, so I run into Chuck, offer my condolences that Blair can't be trusted, suggest the best way to retaliate is offer amnesty to Jenny, and as an added bonus, my dad and Lily get the first anniversary they deserve.
Let's see how strong the holy alliance is after this air strike.
Hello? Surprise! It's me! Serena, I don't think coming here is a good idea.
I'm just dropping off a copy of my favorite book, "The Beautiful and Damned.
" Where is she? I know she's up here.
Serena, meet Ilana.
My housekeeper.
You, uh, were jealous of my housekeeper.
I saw you get her from a cab.
I always pay her cab fare.
Stop smiling.
She's gorgeous, and I'm going a little crazy here.
I know.
Me, too.
Let's be honest.
We may sit across from each other, talking about bagels versus brioche, but all we're thinking Is what it would be like to have breakfast in bed? Okay, as much as it it kills me to say this, no more office hours.
I just can't be alone in a room with you.
So other than class, I'll see you in six weeks.
Other than tonight.
The dean just e-mailed that my presence is requested at a party apparently at your place.
You're invited to Blair's birthday? S.
, I can't talk now.
Did you invite the entire Columbia faculty to your party tonight? I may have invited the dean and whomever she favors.
Why do you care? You're not going.
Well, the anniversary party was canceled, so yes, I am.
And now it turns out so is Colin.
Unless you mean Firth or Farrell, I'm not listening, the dean will be there.
Need I say more? Chuck.
Hey.
Uh, hey, man.
I was just stopping by to see Nate.
But I-I guess he's not here.
He's in his room.
Oh, he is? He's not he's not at class? I would've thought You really don't know how to stage a run-in, do you? Cut to the chase.
Well, uh, since Blair betrayed you with your uncle, I thought maybe you could betray her back, call my sister, offer her protection.
Well, you're just about six months late for that, aren't ya, Humphrey? Hey, I, uh, I didn't expect to see you here.
I assumed That Chuck and I would be back at war after that silly "Gossip Girl" blast? It was obviously fake.
What gave you that idea? We have enemies, Humphrey.
All powerful people do.
We anticipated someone would try to mess with us.
And this handiwork has your lying little sister's fingerprints all over it.
Besides, Jack Bass wasn't in France last summer.
He was in Chile.
Again, uh, how did you know that? I must've read about it somewhere.
Regardless, this incident inspired us to add a new addendum to the treaty.
The notary just left.
Now wait wait a second.
There there there's a treaty? Like an actual legal document? Humphrey, the intricacies of our war games are too complex for prole like you to fathom.
As an additional gesture of trust, Chuck, I would like to invite you to my birthday party this evening.
I gratefully accept.
And since Gothic Barbie remains safely quarantined upstate, feel free to stop by if you're feeling lonely.
Serena.
Hey.
So it turns out you were wrong about the professor.
He is waiting for me.
But waiting is not easy.
I don't trust myself to be in a room with him.
I'm sorry.
Normally, I would talk to Blair about this, but she doesn't approve.
Some people are such prudes.
Yeah.
Well, anyway, we agreed to stay away from each other, but tonight we both have to go to Blair's birthday, and a lot of faculty are going, including the dean.
The dean? No kidding.
I get it.
What you need is a buffer Someone to stay by your side, distract you, make sure you two are never alone all night.
I'm happy to help.
Really? Thank you.
Of course, although I'm not sure how Blair will feel about me being at her party.
Well, you'll be my guest.
And and maybe it's a good idea.
She'll get to know the real you.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
You've put yourself in the right hands.
Uh-oh.
Juliet's plans are falling into place, and S.
is primed for a fall.
Hey, man, do you know anything about, uh, Chuck and Blair's so-called peace treaty? Yeah, of course.
It was my idea.
You know, they're really trying to change.
I highly doubt that, but do you by any chance know what's in it? I'm sorry, man.
I can't tell you that.
I gave my word I'd guard it.
Security's coming to pick it up and put it in the safe.
Anyway, there's stuff in there Serena and I don't even know about.
Chuck and Blair made us leave early.
Wait a second.
You saw Serena? I thought we agreed.
You don't have to worry about it, okay? She's seeing someone else.
Can we talk about this later? I'm late for class.
Yeah.
Nate thought he and Humphrey were thick as thieves.
Turns out Humphrey's a thief, and Nate's just thick.
Just the man I was looking for.
Hey.
So I assume you're going to Blair's birthday party tonight? Yep.
Solo, now that things are over with Juliet.
That's actually what I wanted to talk to you about.
Um, she's gonna be my date.
I thought she left me for someone else.
I didn't know it was you.
Come on.
That guy I was telling you about Uh, we're we're trying to stay away from each other, and he's gonna be there tonight, so Juliet offered to chaperone so that I stay strong.
Well, if all you need is a buffer, let me take you.
Well, I don't want to make him jealous.
No, we're just friends.
Let's be honest.
It's better to have a guy protect you from another guy.
You do have a point.
I know I do, plus I'd rather not run into Juliet, so you'd be doing me a favor, too.
Okay.
Juliet, hey.
Uh, change of plans.
I actually don't need your help anymore tonight.
Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, so you can go back to whatever it is I took you away from doing.
Thank you, though.
Yeah.
Bye-bye.
You put gladiolas in my cabbage roses?! The Waldorf's is not a best Western.
Get them out.
Darling, I just got off the phone with Rufus and Lily.
I told them if they can't be with family, they might as well be with friends.
We have to do something special for them.
I suppose powerful women can afford to be generous.
So I'll have to think of some kind of anniversary surprise.
How's the guest list coming? Everyone's who's anyone will be here.
But I-I couldn't help but notice a certain Charles Bass has been added to the list.
Blair, we don't need any trouble.
He'll be no trouble, mother.
He and I are good.
Yeah, so good you have been berating the help all day.
I'm not berating anyone! I just want to be sure that the party is perfect.
Your dress, miss Blair.
Are you kidding? What part of "J.
Mendel" did you not understand? Actually, dear, I picked it out.
Dorota What's going on with me? You aren't fighting with Mr.
Chuck, so you fight with everyone else.
Take it upstairs.
That's their biggest secret? I-I was expecting something a little bit more "American Psycho" not stabbing a homeless man, but at least feeding a cat to an A.
T.
M.
A birthday surprise may be in order.
I think all it'll take is a couple of calls.
Look, Dan, I know we want Jenny to come in for the anniversary, but she fought back last week and nearly lost everything she learned.
You told her that yourself.
Uh, maybe we shouldn't risk the same.
No, we should.
They deserve it.
They're they're they're smug and they are condescending.
They have treaties.
And we're doing it for Jenny.
Dan, we tried.
It didn't work.
I'm out, and I-I-I hope you are, too.
Hi.
Uh, hi.
Rita.
This is Dan, Rufus Humphrey's son.
Yeah, I hope you don't mind me calling, but, uh, I have a very good friend with a birthday party tonight, and and I was hoping I could get your help.
Yeah, do you still work at Interscope? Looks like Brooklyn's in it to win it.
Just what is it exactly? Guess we'll find out tonight.
Zee! Zoe! Hi, love.
Now I know it's a party.
Oh, stop.
You look so chic.
Cheers.
Thanks.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Dean Reuther, I am so thrilled you could make it.
Happy Birthday, Blair.
The guest list is inspired.
Thank you for inviting me And my faculty.
Well, thank you, and I hope you get a chance to chat with Patricia Ireland.
I think she'd be really interested in that paper you wrote for "Yale Law Review" on planned parenthood v.
Casey.
You read that? Of course.
Every woman who cares about her right to choose should.
You know, Blair, I think another we should get to know each other better.
I'll have my assistant set up lunch.
No.
Okay.
O.
M.
G.
The last girl the dean took to lunch became C.
E.
O.
of Pepsi.
Here you go.
I was happy with eating shun Lee out of the carton, Lil.
This is all just very Upper East Side.
Look, I know you think you're rock 'n' roll, but you are wearing a $2,000 jacket.
Happy anniversary Oh! Thank you.
To you! That's a gorgeous blazer.
Thanks for getting me in, but I should go before anybody sees us together.
Of course.
Have fun.
That guy I told you about is here.
Please distract me.
Okay.
Don't look over there, but my lit professor Look at his pants.
Look at 'em.
I bet you 10 bucks they're held up with a rubber band.
He wears them every single day.
Yeah, it's ridiculous.
Dan, hey.
I didn't realize you were coming.
Yeah, it was kind of a last minute thing.
I-I, uh, I didn't know you were coming together.
Oh, no.
We're we're not You know something? I'm gonna go I'm gonna hit the cheese table.
I'll see you later.
Serena.
Hi.
So this is your new buffer.
Yeah.
I didn't know you were still coming.
I came with a friend.
It's nice to see you two having fun.
Yeah, well, you're not exactly dying of loneliness.
Nate Can you give us a moment, please? Yeah.
I'm I'm sorry.
I hope it's not too awkward that I came with him.
I know things are difficult between you two right now.
No, it's okay.
I'm I'm not worried about Nate.
So where is the mysterious professor? Hmm? Which one is he? I'm not gonna tell you that.
Nate's gone off and left you alone.
How am I supposed to step in to be your backup if I don't know who to protect you from? Okay, but you can't tell anyone.
I could kill the caterer.
The appetizer tray looks like a Rorschach test.
You! You're you're the one who did such a wonderful job at the fashion's night out.
Come.
Help me with those trays.
Why are you talking to that horrible Juliet, and what are you doing here with Nate? Well, you'll be happy to know that Colin and I Hey! My ears don't register his name.
Are trying to stay away from each other, which is why I brought Nate as a buffer.
And since you won't listen to my Colin problems, I had to go to Juliet for advice.
Serena, do you have amnesia? Juliet isn't your friend.
She's actually proven to be a pretty good friend since she saved me from Vanessa's takedown.
Oh, please, if I want to hear fiction, I'll go talk to Jonathan Franzen.
In fact Son! What are you doing here? I could say the same to you.
I-I thought you were gonna be having your romantic night alone at home.
Eleanor convinced them to come celebrate among friends.
Oh, no.
But but but you but you can't stay here.
It'd be bad luck.
You know, everything here is on China and crystal.
You gotta You gotta go home and celebrate on paper plates as planned.
You know, I am surprised that you are so superstitious, Dan.
Let's face it.
Our plan to stay at home was pretty depressing.
Yeah, let's go check out those cookies in the shape of Blair's shoes.
Okay.
Hey, why why why didn't you warn me they were coming? I didn't think I needed to.
Oh, you didn't actually go through with it, did Oh, you did.
Uh, okay.
Can can can you put a stop to it before it's too late? You look lovely tonight.
It's so cold in here.
I can barely feel my fingers.
Cold? I'm practically feverish.
I must tell Dorota to turn up the air.
Just one thing before you go.
I was wondering how did you know where Jack was? I think I must have read it online.
That's strange.
Last I heard, he was off the grid.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm entertaining.
Good to see you, Serena.
I better go find Eleanor before she wonders why I haven't said hello.
Good to see you, too, Cynthia.
Nice meeting you.
Okay, see? That was a great distraction, right? What are you look what are you looking at? He's flirting with someone.
Don't look at him.
Look at me.
Okay, remember when Mrs.
Salazar made us memorize the Gettysburg address? Look at me and recite it.
What? Just do it.
Just go.
"Four score and and and seven years ago" Okay.
"Our fathers" Don't flair your nostrils at me.
"Brought to this continent, a new nation, uh" Keep going.
"Conceived in liberty" You're doing well.
"And dedicated to the proposition" That you are an incredible chaperone.
I know.
Oh, hi, darling.
Nate, Serena, hello.
Hey, happy anniversary.
I'm so glad we can all be together.
Oh, thank you, darling.
Well, it looks like you're in good hands now.
I'll catch up with you later.
Excuse me.
Uh, you wouldn't happen to be Ben, would you? I'm sorry? I just saw you with Juliet.
I figured if you're the guy she left me for, then your name must be Ben? No.
I'm sorry.
My mistake.
Miss, I have a note for you.
Paper plates are bad for the environment.
Oh, come on, Rufus.
It's not gonna kill anyone if we use paper plates just for one day.
Uh, excuse me.
I'm going to the restroom.
I mean, we all have to do our part.
When was the last time you used a paper plate? Nate! Come on.
I need a drink.
Yeah, the bar is right here.
We can just Yeah, well, screw the bar.
We keep the good stuff in the kitchen.
Come with me.
I don't believe it.
You've been seeing Ben?! Shh! We can't talk about this here, okay? Please? No one can see us together.
Okay? Fine.
But you bet your ass we're talking about this.
So that is the guy that Juliet broke up with me for.
He just lied to my face.
Juliet's dating him, too? "Too"? So is Serena.
I knew that Juliet was evil.
I have to go warn Serena.
If you left me for that guy, you can say so.
You know, why is it such a big secret? It's not what you think.
Now if you don't mind No, first you're gonna tell me what's going on.
You've lied to me enough.
He's my cousin, Nate.
And the reason we don't want people to know is because he's a teacher, and I'm a student and he's dating Serena.
Oh, my God.
She borrow my tiara.
She not give it back yet.
But that's okay.
She is 20.
She deserve 20 tiaras.
She has great heart, style, and grace Even when she get mad.
Happy Birthday, miss Blair! Hi, everyone.
I'm Rita, and I'd also like to salute the birthday girl, and I brought some special friends to help me with the toast.
Or should I say "roast"? Who is that woman? Robyn.
She's an incredible musician.
Hey, I tried Rita's cell and got no answer.
I-I-I think she's busy.
Luckily, Robyn was working with me in New York this week and able to bring along a very special video of Blair.
What is it? A Jack Bass s*x tape? A Nelly Yuki snuff film? Let me take you back to a summer night in Stockholm, to an afterparty for one of Robyn's shows.
No.
Hey! Blair just kidding! * And show the world * No! No! Ohh! Hey, Robyn.
Jealous? Is she all right? I'm fine.
Ohh.
I'm coming on tour! I Die.
Ha ha ha! * Will you tell me once again? * How could you bring that video here? I'm sorry.
I got a call.
He said it was a roast.
Of course he did.
"He" who? Charles Bartholomew Bass.
Who else? I told you not to invite him.
* When I'm ready to give in * * Will you pick me up again * * Then I guess you can * You were flirting with that model.
You were flirting with that lacrosse player.
He's my friend, and I was just using him to stay away from you.
You were trying to make me jealous? No, I wasn't.
But were you jealous? We're in your bedroom.
I don't think I can make it six weeks.
Well, maybe staying away from each other is so hard because that's not what we should be doing.
Maybe * All heart* I am in complete agreement.
* Blissfully painful in insanity * I really want this, but not here.
* Oh, whoaYou can hang * * With me * You know how ashamed I am of that video.
"Stand by your man"? Gossip Girl is offering a cash reward.
It only takes one video to topple an entire career.
If you don't believe me, just YouTube "Connie Chung piano.
" Blair, just listen to me.
Why did you do it, huh? Because I knew that Jack was in Chile last summer? I only found out because I was desperate for news of you.
You were? All summer, when I was pretending not to care, I wanted to know where you were.
I paid a private eye to look, but the only Bass he got was your scaly uncle.
Blair, as much as I hate being at peace with you, I didn't do this.
If you can stand there and lie to my face, then you're either pure evil or just a common sociopath.
You really believe that? Of course I do! And even if Nate and Serena peeked at the treaty, you're the only one with a motive.
Actually, there was someone else.
* Painful in insanity * Is this a joke? You did this? My sister doesn't feel safe to live in her own house or be with her parents on their anniversary.
She was a different person before she met the two of you.
Come on, Dan.
It's not about Jenny.
It may have started out that way, but this is about you and getting revenge, and you went behind my back to get it.
I know, Nate, but come on.
They deserve what they get.
I'm not sorry.
No, I'm the one who's sorry.
I'm sorry you've become one of them.
* Oh, whoa, you can hang * * With me * Blair, we had a treaty.
* Hang with me * Okay, we have a big problem.
Serena's professor is Colin our cousin Colin.
And what's the problem? He has no idea what we're doing! If he finds out, I-I will lose everything! Don't tell me about losing everything.
I'm sorry.
I know that there's no love lost between you two, but I need him.
He pays for my school, my rent.
What you need is to get Serena caught with her professor, whoever he is.
Did you get the proof like we talked about? Not yet, but, Ben, he obviously has no idea who she is, that's she's the one responsible for all It's because she's responsible that you have to do this.
It is the only way to make things right.
It is the only way for our family to ever move on.
Now please, Jules, get the proof and get Serena expelled.
Robyn gave this to me, and she swore it was her only copy.
You are safe.
Well, that's good news, I guess.
But I'm still mortified.
Dean Reuther saw it.
Madeleine Albright.
I-I'm a failure at 20.
Are you kidding? Elsa Maxwell says that a good party gives people what they don't expect.
Well I suppose watching Rachel Zoe get dipped in chocolate like a strawberry wasn't boring.
Nothing around you ever is.
Something else is wrong? What I want is to be a powerful woman.
But whenever Chuck's around, I just feel like a weak little girl.
I shut myself off for a long time after your father left.
I was cold and hard.
Then I met Cyrus, and he taught me that sometimes you have to allow yourself to be weak in order to grow stronger.
Well, that sounds good, but it feels terrible.
You don't have to lose the girl to be a woman.
Just need to think maybe about how many people are going to be around the next time you let her out.
I am going to bed.
Good night.
It was just a silly karaoke video.
At least no one got hurt.
Yeah, I just I've never seen Dan like that.
I pray it's an isolated event.
I'd hate to think I lost both my kids to the Upper East Side.
Well, I'd hate for you to think that, too.
What? That's a lot of paper.
Eric! Did you do this? Well, I helped, but it was all Dan.
Well, maybe there's a little Humphrey left in that kid after all.
You know, there are ten minutes left of our anniversary.
You know, just enough time to save it.
Hey.
So I wrecked Blair's birthday and I betrayed Nate, I've disappointed my dad, and as the icing on the cake, I pretty much ruined his and Lily's anniversary.
Other than that How was your night? It was Blair's 20th birthday party, and I'm still acting like an eighth grader! Oh, my God.
Is it possible the Upper East Side is contagious? I think we've proven that it is.
We just need some rest and a good dose of Brooklyn.
Yeah.
Thanks for being here.
We've been friends forever, and that's not gonna change.
Dad, I am so sorry.
Wait a second.
You liked it? At the end of every war, the warriors come home, hoping what they've seen and done won't stay with them forever.
Anthony patch is more tragic than Gatsby.
I can't believe you actually read it.
Well, why wouldn't I? You gave it to me.
You know, I think I like you too much to do this right now.
We've come this far, and the old me would've gone farther, but the new me really wants to wait.
I'm glad I know the new you.
She's a great teacher.
Ugh.
So, six more weeks Yeah.
At least we stopped ourselves before we made a mess of everything.
No one found out, so we're safe.
Well, in that case Buddha once said, "it's better to conquer yourself than to win a thousand battles.
" But other soldiers can't give up the fight and go underground to plan the next war.
See ya.
But it's the true warrior who knows that wars don't end.
They simply change.
And there can never be peace as long as guns are still loaded and there's plenty of ammunition.
What are you still doing here, Chuck? I threw you out hours ago.
I wanted to let you know the treaty is over.
Fine with me.
This pretense of civility was exhausting.
Being amicable isn't in our blood.
I've realized we're not friends.
Friends have to like each other.
And after what happened tonight, I could never like you.
I could never like you either.
In fact, I hate you.
I've never hated anyone more.
Every nerve ending in my body is electrified by hatred.
There is a fiery pit of hate burning inside me, ready to explode.
So it's settled then? We're settled.
* I'm giving it all * * But I'm not the girl you're taking home * * Ooh, ooh, ooh * * I keep dancing on my own * * I keep dancing on my own Oh, yeah * * I'm in the corner, * * watching you kiss her * * I'm right over here, why can't you see me? * These weapons may be deadly.

Gossip Girl here your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Vanessa stole my phone and sent an e-mail to my Professor.
I did not do this.
I wanted to be friends, but what did you expect me to do? Serena's Professor is Colin Our cousin Colin.
And what's the problem? I need him.
He pays for my school, my rent.
Relationships with faculty are strictly forbidden.
I don't think I can make it six weeks.
At least we stopped ourselves before we made a mess of everything.
No one found out, so we're safe.
You're different than anyone I've ever known.
Well, you know what? Just save it.
'Cause you're exactly like everyone I've ever known.
A peace treaty based on more than just a handshake.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

Morning, Upper East Siders.
Hope you had a good night's sleep Or at least a good night's play.
I need to talk.
I'm having Colin issues.
And boundary issues.
Ladies knock.
And besides, the only issue you should be having with Professor Forrester is the topic of your midterm.
Now if you don't mind, I'd like to hit the snooze button on this conversation and go back to Okay.
All I can think about is how much I wanna be on his arm at the ballet.
And instead, I've got the dean's target on my back.
How are we supposed to even try to have a relationship? I hate it when the duvet puffs up like that.
Maybe it's just the way you're sitting.
I know we agreed to wait, but it feels like meanwhile, life is just passing us by.
It's it's not fair.
Life is tough, Serena.
Just Get a helmet.
Or at least borrow one of my chapeaus.
Wear it all day to remind you not to lose your Head.
Get on! Go! Well, thank you for the great advice.
This comforter blocks out so much noise, they could sell it at Bose.
Ugh.
This has got to end.
I thought it just did.
That was the last time.
Hey.
I'm, uh, headed over to my dad and Lily's for breakfast.
Do you wanna come? Actually, I have a lot of work.
But if you could swipe some Santa Maria novella soap for me while you're there That's right.
The, uh, olive oil, not the mint.
I know.
I had no idea you were a Colin Forrester fan.
I saw Matt Lauer interview him on the "today" show recently.
Yeah? What what was it about? Who was cuter.
Or maybe that was just me.
Well, he's no Maria Bartiromo, but he is Serena's Professor, and she's been raving about him, so I figured I'd borrow that book from her.
And you checked out of this conversation the minute the "s" word came up.
Sorry, but ever since the Hamilton house debacle, I'm dead to anyone in Serena's life, except for you.
Nate doesn't even return my calls.
Well if it makes you feel any better, he's not talking to me, either.
He's still pissed that I stole that treaty.
Well, unlike you, I didn't do anything.
Juliet framed me.
She's crazy.
Is any of this ringing a bell? Vanessa, let's not get into this again.
We we put it behind us.
We'll leave it there.
All right? I got it.
We're good.
I'll call you later.
Hi! Sorry I'm late.
I had to pull an all-nighter just to finish "persuasion" for my comp lit class.
Apparently, even Jane Austen can have a misfire.
Nice try.
You're just trying to avoid finishing our conversation from the other night.
You promised me you weren't in contact with Ben.
I'm all he has.
It's not that easy for him.
Prison shouldn't be easy, especially when you deserve to be there.
He didn't do it.
You're the only person that thinks that.
Why else would his lawyer have him plead guilty? Look, I understand he's your brother and you love him, but you are playing with fire.
Oh, really? And you're not? What is that supposed to mean? I saw the way that you were looking at Serena Van Der Woodsen at Blair Waldorf's party the other night.
If you'll excuse me, I'm running late, so let me just say this I may pay for your life here, but if you continue to see your brother, it will cost you, and this is what you will lose.
You know how much money you can make in lobsters? No, Daniel, I do not.
Sorry, I just kind of assumed when you invited me for family breakfast that there would be, uh, more family involved.
Yeah, so did I, but I forgot about Lily and Eric going to his interview at Wesleyan.
And Serena? Do you know where she is this morning? 'Cause, I mean, you know, Nate mentioned Uh, she might be seeing someone.
Well, Lily hasn't said anything.
Why don't you just ask her? Because I have a vested interest in her answer.
Things between us got so sidetracked after everything with Milo and and and Vanessa.
I just would like to get them figured out once and for all.
I don't know how she feels.
So take her to coffee or something and ask her.
You're right.
I'll just go find her on campus.
I'm gonna go for broke today.
I'm glad I could be so influential.
Oh, no, it's actually the title of chapter one here "Going for Broke," but, um, you're awesome, too, dad.
Yo! Where have you been? You haven't been home in days.
Well, the New York marathon was this weekend.
Those women run 26.
2 miles in under 3 hours, so their warm-ups are key.
What about you? Things back on with Juliet? A romantic rendezvous? No, that's over.
I'm just actually swinging by her place to return her things she left at the suite.
I just gotta get rid of them so I can finally be done.
Closure the unobtainable goal.
In my personal experience, the closest I've come to getting it is through mass amounts of hate s*x.
But that's just me.
I think I'll stick to giving Juliet her shampoo and copy of "the help" back.
Well, you go ahead.
I've left my blackberry in the limo.
You're holding it.
Then I need another ristretto.
See you around.
What if someone sees? You don't like that anymore? No, you idiot.
I mean, what if someone we know sees? What what am I saying? There will be nothing to see.
This ends here.
What about over there? Okay.
Hurry.
You realize this breaks our pact not to be alone together.
Ah, it wasn't us.
It was fate.
I mean, can we help it if we're in the same place at the same time, hailing the same cab? It has happened before.
Numerous times, which is why you know how long it would've taken to hail another one during rush hour.
I'm having a whole new appreciation for pleather seats with duct tape.
Though where I really wanna be with you is at the ballet tonight.
It would be in public, so we'd be forced to restrain ourselves.
Unfortunately, I know more than a few Columbia faculty members who are big supporters of the Balanchine.
Probably not a good idea.
You're right.
I just hate that we have to wait over a month to have another accidental cab ride together.
Unless that's enough for you? Why don't we go away for the weekend? What? We can go to Harbour island.
We can spend days on the beach and nights having long talks over dinner.
Separate rooms, of course, so no rules get broken.
We're almost there.
What are you thinking? I'm packing in my head already.
In a city that never sleeps, it's important to always be alert Because if you blink, you might miss something Or someone.
Yes, hi.
I need to make an appointment with dean Reuther right away.
I have something that she wants to see.
But be careful, since the truth can be eye-opening.
Hey, excuse me.
I'm dropping some stuff off for Juliet Sharp.
Who? Juliet Sharp.
Uh, 4a, I think it is? I'm sorry.
There's no one named Sharp in this building Or Juliet for that matter, at least not in the eight years I've worked here.
Good morning, Upper East Siders.
This is your wake-up call.
Serena.
What are you doing on campus so early? Watching you climb out of a brownstone vestibule with Chuck following like the Bass that ate the canary.
And no denials.
Your skirt's on backwards.
No, it isn't.
Fine, I may have slipped up a little, but it's just s*x, and a one-time thing at that.
Or maybe a 5-time thing.
Okay, if we're being honest, I've lost count how many times Though that depends on what you're actually counting as Blair, what are you doing? You've come so far.
Don't fall off the wagon now.
I haven't.
It's just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill ex s*x, fueled by the most common of aphrodisiacs mutual loathing and disdain.
May I remind you that both of those are feelings? And having any feelings for Chuck is where the problems always start.
There are about as many feelings between me and Chuck as there are thoughts in Levi Johnston's head.
We're nothing more than enemies with benefits.
And quite a lot of judgment coming from you, Elizabeth Taylor.
You're about one inappropriate relationship away from the Guinness book.
Colin and I actually had a very good talk this morning, and he wants a real relationship, too.
Yes, I hear the 97th street transverse is a lovely spot to drive past on a date.
I saw you get in that cab.
We happen to be going away this weekend so we can get to know each other like a normal couple while still adhering to our rules, of course.
Please.
Do you forget what happens to you on vacations? There's a reason why you never get a tan line.
You have no willpower.
And you do? Yes.
I stopped having meaningful s*x with Chuck, and I can just as easily stop having meaningless s*x with him.
In fact, I am going to call him right now and make it clear that our little dalliance is finished forever.
And maybe you should follow my example before you get your passport stamped again.
Hey.
This how you return phone calls now? I went to Juliet's apartment this morning, and it turns out she doesn't live there.
She never has.
What? Look, I'm sorry, Vanessa.
I should've believed you when you said she set you up.
Juliet's a liar.
She's been lying to me this whole time.
Finally! Took someone long enough.
But seriously, I-I appreciate you telling me.
Enough to help me find out what she's hiding? Let me see writing a paper on Hannah Arendt or a secret mission that might help me clear my name? Let me grab my bag.
All right.
Why do you have mad face? Is everything okay? No, it's not okay.
You should know better.
I think I missed something.
I didn't.
I saw you this morning getting out of a cab with Colin Forrester.
Are you having an affair with your Professor? Well, technically, he's a guest lecturer, and, no, it's not an affair because we agreed not to do anything until the semester's over.
It's romantic.
What would be romantic is him actually making a sacrifice for you.
What are you saying? When we were together, I would've done anything for you.
So if this billionaire really cares about you, then why can't he quit teaching, take you on a date? You're worth more than a guest lecturer fee.
Everyone knows that.
I just wish you did.
s*x in the limo.
We've literally come full circle.
You're right.
We need to do whatever we can to end this.
It may be difficult, but it's the only way.
Arthur, we need to pick up some Klug du Mensil '95 And lots of condoms.
It's going to be a long day of immersion therapy.
If Blair and I are going to end this, we'll have to have s*x as many times as we can in the next 24 hours.
Dorota, you have to keep me away from Chuck for the next 24 hours, no matter what.
But, miss Blair Don't "miss Blair" me! The only way to be done with this thing once and for all is to have a Bass-ectomy.
Now help keep me occupied.
Hey.
I was just on my way to your office.
Look, I've been thinking Think no more.
We're about to go on vacation.
We leave tomorrow morning.
At least I do.
What do you mean? I'm on a 9:00 A.
M.

  flight, and you'll be on the 11
0.
Separate flights? We'll meet at the pink sands.
Your room's under your name.
I always book mine under "buffett.
" Uh-oh.
I can tell you're thinking again.
Yeah, I'm just thinking maybe this trip isn't such a great idea.
Okay.
Fine.
We won't go anywhere.
We'll just go back to waiting, tough it out.
But we shouldn't have to.
We say we want a real relationship, but the truth is neither one of us is willing to make a sacrifice.
I'm confused.
We both knew the deal going in.
What's changed? I did, I guess.
I don't know.
Maybe we're not such a great idea.
What happened when you got out of the cab? We both know that this is just a case of bad timing.
I'm just the first one to say it.
I'm sorry.
I was surprised you called.
I really thought you never wanted to talk to me again.
'Cause you broke up with me doesn't mean we can't be friends, right? *** Sorry.
Chuck's asking where the batteries are.
Okay, now I know you're lying.
I wish I knew when you were.
It would've saved me a lot of time now, wouldn't it? Nate, what's going on here? I should be asking you that.
I went to your apartment today, and they said you don't live there, okay.
And I thought for sure I was done giving a damn about you, but I just can't let it go.
I mean, why why do you need to lie about everything? Because I didn't want you to see where I really live.
My actual apartment is a studio on 126th street, and I I couldn't even afford that if it weren't for my cousin.
He pays for my rent, my tuition, and the rest of the stuff, I scrape together or return When I can, okay? So that's what you've been hiding? That that you're Poor? Do you really think I would've been keymaster of Hamilton house if people knew I took metro north to Woodbury common twice a month? Or that I do my own hair? And would Nate Archibald really have wanted to date me if he knew I lived above a bodega in a fifth floor walk-up with fluorescent lights and Ikea furniture I put together myself? When my dad went to jail, I had nothing, okay? So I know I know what it's like to feel the need to keep up.
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I was ashamed.
And that's the reason I broke it off between us, because I I didn't want to get too close.
But I did really like you, and I still like you.
I should probably get going No, no, no, no.
Wait.
Wait.
You finally told me the truth, and I'm a big believer in second chances.
I've had a couple in my life.
There's the, uh, winter opening for the New York city ballet tonight.
Would you wanna come? Maybe wear a dress that you actually own, even if it's from Woodbury common? Yes, I would love to.
Thank you for understanding.
You can't even imagine how much it means to me.
*** They say a picture's worth a thousand words.
But in this case, it seems like there's only three letters to adequately describe these pictures O.
M.
G.
** ** ** Dorota! Blair, is there something we need to talk about? This is no cause for concern, Serena.
I know I said I was quitting Chuck, and I am.
It's just a bit harder to Chuck Chuck than I thought.
What if I need s*x rehab like Jesse James? You're gonna overcome this, maybe because I overcame my obstacle today.
I showed some willpower, and I broke up with Colin.
Good for you.
For once, you're thinking with your brain and not with your Macaroon? If he really wanted to be with me, all he needed to do was just drop the class.
It was a class that he didn't want or need to teach anyway.
You are Serena Van Der Woodsen.
You deserve a guy who would move mountains to be with you if he had to.
I've been thinking about that all day.
And you're Blair Waldorf.
Fortitude is your talent.
Stay strong.
I'll see you at the ballet.
Gotta go make a call.
Thank you for letting me come by.
I just I wanted to let you know in person that I heard what you said about Ben, and I'm taking your advice.
I'm cutting off all communication with him.
Glad to hear it.
What changed your mind? There's this guy that I like, and I broke up with him because Ben wanted me to.
And now this guy, Nate he wants to try again.
And I can't say no to a second chance.
It's just it's so hard giving up on Ben.
I mean, you remember what he was like before? He was so optimistic, idealistic.
I mean, the day he became a teacher was the happiest day of his life.
And I guess I just I still see him like that.
I know, but he's not that person anymore.
He's a 26-year-old convict who still hasn't taken responsibility for his actions.
He's not gonna be able to move on until he accepts what happened.
I guess I don't want to accept it either.
But I have to.
I have to stop talking to him for my own good.
Thank you.
Sometimes you have to let things go so there's room for better things to come into your life.
Well put.
Your words.
"Winner!" Chapter three.
Those were my words, weren't they? Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?! Step any closer, and I'll scream.
You better believe you will.
If we're going to end this, we have to start the immersion therapy right away.
What are you talking about? This is a detox.
We have to stay away from each other.
Where's the fun in that? Cleanses aren't fun.
They're effective.
You know what's even more effective? Excess.
Eat anything too much, and you won't want it again.
I hope you did your yoga.
This could go on a while.
No! Miss Blair, no! Professor Forrester is downstairs.
What? Why? He's here for me as my date.
A date? Yes, and I must leave now to go to the ballet with him and not have s*x with you.
If KGB can't get me to talk, Chuck Bass has no chance.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing tonight? I got a hot date with some Grimaldi's and Netflix.
Why? Well, I ended it with Colin.
Oh, you did? That's terrible.
No, you were right about him, so it's actually good.
But DVDs and pizza, really? What, you got a better offer? How do you feel about ballet? Watching or performing? Meet me at the Lincoln center fountain in an hour, and we'll discuss both after.
Okay, I'll be there.
Blair.
Is Serena here? No, but the better question is, why are you here? I came to my senses and did what I should've done weeks ago.
I called the dean and told her I am done teaching at Columbia, even managed to find a replacement.
Just when I had written you off Well, not "just.
" I kind of wrote you off weeks ago.
Sorry.
But now you're coming with me.
We're gonna go find Serena so you two unfairly genetically blessed people can be together, and I can escape the best s*x of anyone's life based solely on principle.
And if anyone asks, you're my date.
Blair! Hurry.
There's a Bass on the loose, and it's hungry.
Actually So am I.
Vanessa! What How did you know that I That you live here? I saw you check into Ollie's a lot on foursquare, so I paid the delivery man to give me your address, and slipping some cash to your super got me in your door.
You should probably move to a safer neighborhood.
Why would you break into my apartment? Because I was looking for something to prove to everyone that you're the crazy liar that I know you are.
And, well, mission accomplished.
And then I found this.
Please, you don't understand.
Juliet, I'm sorry I didn't believe you when you said Serena sent the e-mail.
You were right.
She was trading s*x for grades all along.
But don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.
I'm far more interested in exposing Serena Van Der Woodsen than some petty class pretender.
Thanks, I guess, but I don't plan on showing those pictures to anyone.
Why not? You have just what you need to destroy Serena and vindicate me.
Vanessa, I am so sorry that you got dragged into this, and I wish that I could fix it for you, but I'm no longer interested in taking down Serena.
In fact, the only thing that I'm doing with those photos is deleting them.
You you you can't be serious.
You have just what you need to show the world who Serena really is, and you just now decide to change? I had to make a choice, so I chose.
Fine.
It's better if we put this behind us.
Looks like the chip on Vanessa's shoulder just went digital.
Colin, this is Gillian Murphy and Ethan Stiefel of American ballet theatre.
Excuse me.
I'll, uh, I'll see you inside, yeah? Yeah.
Dan Humphrey at the opening night of the ballet? Let me guess Serena's date? Ah, and you were last week.
Yeah.
She's probably just using you to make that Colin guy jealous, just like she used me at Blair's.
Actually, she and Colin broke up.
Is that so? Hi! I don't understand.
You brought Colin as your date? Are you on a sugar high? No.
He's your date, not mine.
Shall we head inside? Sorry, man.
You shouldn't have thought you were any different.
I resigned from Columbia.
I don't care about being a teacher.
I care about being with you.
I can't believe you did that.
What I can't believe is how long it took me to do it.
Blair, we need to talk, or, rather, not talk.
What don't you get? I'm here with a date.
Professor Forrester isn't a date.
He's a distraction.
Keep your focus.
Give in to your desires, your needs.
Let's finish this the right way.
Colin isn't a distraction.
You are.
What? He and I made a deal.
We couldn't be together until the class was over, but it's so hard.
So I had to work out my desires somewhere.
Nice try.
I'll be waiting in a telephone booth across from the dress circle.
See you in five.
Help yourself, sir.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Opening night of the ballet tuxedos, champagne.
Of course you'd be here.
Just a heads-up, Serena's here, Blair, Chuck, the whole gang.
The person I'm here to see is dean Reuther.
She's a big supporter of the ballet.
I-I assume she's around here somewhere.
Everyone your own age is mad at you, so you're befriending the dean? Juliet was right about Serena.
She's having an affair with her Professor.
How do you know that? I found pictures of Serena and Colin Forrester at Juliet's apartment.
What? Juliet took photos of Serena? And now everyone will know the truth.
Vanessa.
Don't do that.
Why? For Serena? Sorry, Nate.
Dan, wait.
I think I've waited enough.
Tell me something, Serena.
How how far down the list did you get before you called me to be your date? I mean, obviously, you couldn't come with Colin since he's your Professor, and Nate was last week's beard.
So so what does that make me? Bachelor number three? I didn't know Colin was coming.
I also didn't know that he quit his job to be with me.
Okay.
So what now? Why do I even ask? Thank you, all, for coming to tonight's benefit, kicking off the winter season of the New York city ballet.
Tonight's program is dedicated to the late George Balanchine, a true pioneer in the world of dance and the founder of this great organization, and a good friend of mine.
Hear, hear! Hear, hear.
Excuse me.
Yes? Dean Reuther, hi.
Oh my Vanessa Abrams, is that you? My apologies, dean.
I haven't seen this one since Exeter! Mm! No problem, Ms.
Sharp.
Have a nice evening.
You, too.
Exeter? Seriously? What are you doing here? And why were you talking to the dean? Maybe because you aren't.
I gave you back your camera, but I kept the memory card.
Hey, I thought we decided not to do anything with that.
No, you decided.
I've been losing to Serena for three years, watching her get away with anything and everything, and I'm over it.
Tell you don't feel the same way.
I mean, there's obviously a reason you took these photos.
Yeah, there was, but I had a change of heart.
If you're doing this because of Nate, then you should know the truth.
He set you up.
How do you think he took you to coffee out of the blue? He kept you occupied while I searched your apartment.
And I, uh, told Nate about the photos.
And I'm pretty sure he's filling in Blair right now.
Face it.
At the end of the day, you're an outsider just like me.
And if it's ever between one of us and Serena Van Der Woodsen, they will always choose Serena.
Excuse me, dean Reuther.
I have something that you need to see.
Put on your toe shoes, Serena.
It's gonna be hard to dance your way out of this one.
I have proof that Serena Van Der Woodsen is having an affair with her Professor.
Ms.
Sharp, I am here with friends.
This is the one night of the year where I get to try and put everything else out of my mind and just enjoy myself.
Dean Reuther, may I please have a moment with you? Of course you're involved with this, Ms.
Waldorf.
I told you and Ms.
Van Der Woodsen to try and stay off my radar.
Dean Reuther, I'm not lying.
What's going on? Nothing that concerns you, Professor, or concerns anyone for the moment.
Actually, it does concern Colin.
He's the one in the photos with Serena.
Is that why you resigned your position today? While it's true that I resigned because of my involvement with a student, it's nobody's business who that student is.
All that matters is that the responsibility is mine, and I took it by leaving my post.
That's somewhat admirable, Colin.
And while usually it's the Professor in the student-Professor relationship that takes responsibility for any impropriety, if that student is under suspicion of trading s*x for grades in the past, I think we might need to examine the situation a little more closely.
Oh, let me get my camera.
Here.
Look as close as you want.
Oh, let me help you with that.
Oops.
You didn't want to look at those photos anyway because it wasn't Serena in them.
It was me.
Blair, you don't have to do this.
Why would I jeopardize my college career by lying? So go ahead, fire Colin.
Oh, wait.
He already quit.
Allegro! If I could say something, I, for one, completely corroborate Ms.
Waldorf's story.
She was indeed having an affair with Professor Forrester.
I know this because I keep tabs on everyone Blair sees and talks to, due to my insatiable jealousy.
Though she did state something to the effect that he didn't quite satisfy her like I used to.
It's true.
Don't you see? They're all protecting each other.
This is what they always do.
I'm sorry.
Who are you? Ms.
Sharp, the reality is that with no proof, I can't tell who is telling the truth.
Yeah, well, there was proof, until Blair drowned it.
Juliet, I don't like tattletales much more than I like young women who use their sexuality to further their academic careers.
So if you will please excuse me, I'm going to try my best to enjoy this performance, which, hopefully, is a little more graceful than the one I've just seen.
Good evening.
Excuse me, Serena.
You took photos of me?! What the hell were you thinking?! You should've never gotten involved with Serena Van Der Woodsen in the first place.
I tried to warn you.
Oh, yeah, you really had my back.
I always knew Ben would eventually turn you against me, but I never thought you would do something like this.
It's not that simple.
I never meant to hurt you.
In this case, the only person you hurt is yourself, because starting now, you are completely cut off.
As far as I'm concerned.
You are as dead to me as your brother.
Colin! Now it's our turn.
Your obsession with Serena has grown tiresome.
Just because you have no money and delusions of grandeur does not make it okay for you to be a single white trash female.
Nate, this isn't me.
You know that.
Why would I ever believe anything you say again? Well, you can believe the part where she does her own hair.
You tried to destroy my friendship with Blair, my reputation, my academic career.
You failed every time, and now it's time for you to go.
I'm trying to.
He's talking about Columbia.
You don't belong there anyway.
If we catch you hanging around again, there will be consequences.
And we're really good at payback.
Spotted one ugly duckling exiled.
Let's hope she doesn't turn into a black swan.
I am so sorry about everything.
I had no idea just how troubled Juliet was.
Oh, there's no way you could've seen it.
She didn't like me before you and I met or she and I met.
She was always jealous of mine and Nate's past.
And when she found out I was seeing you It was the last straw.
But I just don't understand why she would hurt you, though.
I mean, you guys are family.
And from what Nate said, she owes you a lot.
Well, it makes more sense than I'd like it to.
Our family history is Pretty complicated.
But what I will never get is how easy it is for some people to throw away everything that's good just to settle a score.
Well, hang around the Upper East Side a little longer, and you'll see it all the time.
I'm willing to take my chances if you are.
Oh.
When I met you, I was running away from someone.
I'm sorry that I ran right into you.
I'm sorry you gave up teaching for me.
I feel awful.
To be honest, I was never any good.
I hate using a red pen Stop it.
And lecturing in front of kids wearing pajamas is borderline degrading.
So what are you gonna do? Oh, get back to doing what I do well being a businessman.
No relationships, no roots.
Just Work.
That's a horrible idea.
You're a good person.
Someone deserves to have you do more than just put them in a cab.
Good luck, Serena.
Thank you.
Hey, Dan, I don't know where you are right now, but I just got back to my place, and I was wondering if we could meet.
I sorry.
Um, anyway I'll wait outside for you.
Would it be cheesy of me to say "for however long it takes"? Bye.
Would it be cheesy of me to say "for however long it takes"? Bye.
End of messages.
Serena.
Hey.
Nate.
Hey, what are you doing here? I've just been walking around, trying to clear my head after everything that happened tonight.
I think it would take more than just a walk for that.
You know, when, um We had that fight at fashion's night out, you were right.
It was it was Juliet that made me turn on you when you got back from Paris.
You know, I can't help but wonder what would've happened if it weren't for her.
You know, maybe things would be different now.
Different? The two of us, we've been through so much together.
And I just God, I really miss you.
Just give me a second chance.
I won't let you down.
Sometimes in life, we hit a crossroads And are forced to choose which path we want to take.
There's nothing I love more than coming home with a victory under my belt.
What do you think our count is? For us, a million.
The world zero.
Sometimes I think a takedown's better than s*x.
Don't get crazy now.
Well, it's an endorphin rush.
Plus it makes me think of old times.
I really appreciate you stepping up tonight.
I wanted to say you owe me, but for some reason, didn't feel right.
Wow.
Holding back from a threat.
It's almost like something a friend would do.
Maybe that's because that's what we are friends.
Well, who knew it'd take tons of hate s*x and a public takedown for us to finally get here? I should be going.
Good night, Waldorf.
Same to you, Bass.
And there's no way of knowing if our journey will lead us to pleasure or to pain.
Hi.
Um, I'm Juliet Sharp.
You you don't know me, but a friend of ours thinks that we share mutual enemies on the Upper East Side, and, well, I could really use some help from the inside right now.
This this is so weird.
You you probably think I'm crazy.
Uh, well, if you are, I'm sure they made you that way.
Believe me, I know from firsthand experience.
Uh, what exactly did you have in mind? Once we've made our choice, there's no turning back.
Watch out, Upper East Side.
I think this could be the beginning of an ugly friendship.
X.
O.
X.

, Gossip Girl.
Into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Blair, don't fall off the wagon now.
I haven't! It's just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill ex s*x, fueled by the most common of aphrodisiacs mutual loathing and disdain.
Relationships with faculty are strictly forbidden.
When I met you, I was running away from someone.
I'm sorry that I ran right into you.
Good luck, Serena.
Hey, Dan, I'll wait outside for you, for however long it takes.
I really miss you.
Just give me a second chance.
I won't let you down.
You tried to destroy my friendship with Blair, my reputation, my academic career.
You failed every time, and now it's time for you to go.
A friends of ours thinks we that we share mutual enemies on the Upper East Side, and, well, I could really use some help from the inside right now.
What exactly did you have in mind? *** *** And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

, Gossip Girl.
On the Upper East Side, the possibilities are endless.
Dom or Krug, Winston or Cartier, Tory or Stella, eventually, even the people with everything have to choose.
* Shot in some sun-drenched piazza * * Or whatever in Rome * Hey, why are you guys eating? I thought we were going to Sarabeth's.
Uh, we decided we can spread out better here.
There's more room to work.
On what? Your calculus homework? Uh, your love life.
It's a little something called Dan versus Nate.
We're here to help.
And we brought protractors.
A venn diagram? Really? You you seriously expect me to make this monumental decision with colored pencils and graph paper? Don't mock.
Elliot got an 800 on his math S.
A.
T.
Mm-hmm.
Probability, set theory.
It's, uh, basically what they do when you join an online dating service.
Okay, e's harmony, I will submit to your method.
But just so you know, I did choose.
I called Dan right after I broke up with Colin.
And Nate showed up and said some things that I couldn't ignore.
And then? Well, I ignored him, ran up to my room, and haven't spoken to either since.
That's a familiar coping mechanism.
Well let's see how you cope with this.
"Why did Colin Forrester leave Columbia students "eager to learn about the psychology of business? Answer his funny business with Serena Van Der Woodsen.
" Mom, you have to call them and make them print a retraction and an apology.
You know that's not true.
Half of New York saw you kiss him at the ballet.
Dean Reuther would like to see us in her office.
Well, looks like our compatibility worksheet will have to wait.
* Without you, oh * * Oh, oh, oh, oh * Hey, Serena, it's me.
Uh, I saw your thing in the "Post.
" Just wanted you to know Brooklyn is a great place to avoid nasty looks Unless you throw your recycling in the regular trash or try to open a giant chain store with questionable labor practices, but anyway, call me.
I left her the same message, only without the lame Brooklyn joke.
But you shouldn't wait by your phone, man.
Well, last I checked, the only thing Serena wanted from you was to make some billionaire jealous.
Oh! You mean the same thing she wanted from you? Why are you even here? I assume you're responsible.
I totally understand if you guys are still mad at me for what happened with Serena, but obviously, you miss each other.
I'll take that awkward pause as a "yes.
" Don't think this means that I've been calling out your name in my sleep.
It's not like I've been writing "Mrs.
Nate Humphrey" in my notebook.
There's nothing like a friendly benefit to start a day of meetings about getting the empire back on top.
You do thrive in that position.
I'm sure your black and white ball for the hotel association will remind everyone of that.
And with your glow, Anne Archibald will beg you to be the face of her new foundation.
It's a hormonal response to orgasm, nothing more.
What else could it be? What indeed.
Too bad it couldn't get me an While I love to delay your gratification, I can curb your cravings if you'd care to join me there tonight before my party.
You have a reservation? Tonight? I can tell my business associates something came up.
Unless you object.
Nothing wrong with a lobster potpie between friends.
I'll see you at 8:00.
Dorota! I need Sam Brocato and an assortment of Chlo? That's subtle but sexy.
For your meeting with Mrs.
Archibald? No, for my dinner with Chuck.
And I see your brain trying to translate the implications from Polish, but there are none.
So stop thinking and do.
Delucie, it's Chuck Bass.
I need a favor.
I wouldn't ask, but it's important.
Great.
You can at least try to hide your disappointment.
Well, I have nothing to hide.
I simply want to put this behind us.
Even if I have to wear a Scarlet letter for something I didn't do? Dean Reuther, I'm sorry you have to disrupt your day with such trivial matters.
It's hardly trivial, Mrs.
Humphrey.
I'm sure you saw the wall of paparazzi at the campus gates.
Well, I assure you, none of us is interested in this kind of media attention.
I hope you'll let our family make it up to you with an endowment.
Maybe you could use it to build a moat around the school, keep out the press.
The only thing I'd like from your family is to withdraw your daughter from our university.
What? Over a gossip column? Hundreds of parents have called, concerned about teachers.
I'm sorry, Serena.
I have to look at the bigger picture.
It's no longer just your education that's being disrupted.
Well, I'm sure you've realized that Serena was accepted at other Ivy League institutions.
Mom, please.
Well, getting out of the city is probably your best course of action.
We can refund her tuition, and I am happy to facilitate a transfer.
I think you misunderstood me.
Serena chose Columbia.
And despite your judgment, she is the victim here.
And I'm sure "The Times" would love to do an article about a dean who tolerates professors in power positions exploiting female students.
Well, I hope you'll consider my offer.
I swear, I thought I was over Serena until I realized how much Juliet had come between us.
I just felt like we had to try again.
Is that what you were telling her after the ballet? Yeah, until you showed up.
I haven't heard from her since.
Nah, me neither.
So, look, you and I are friends, and we both like the same girl.
We tried pretending that we didn't.
But we do.
And we tried to act like we don't care that we're friends But we do.
Ohh.
That was good.
That was good.
So so what if we both take our best shot, and like the gentlemen we are, agree to be okay with whoever she picks? What are you trying to say? Let the best man win? 'Cause I just did.
I think dean Reuther was actually trembling.
You were very impressive.
I was, wasn't I? Thank you for believing me.
It means a lot.
Well, promise me no more surprises.
You know everything, I swear.
Jenny.
Oh! That's the kind of surprise I like.
I wish I could say the same.
I'm gonna say hi to Eric and Elliot.
Well, nice to see you, too, Serena.
Oh, she's had a rough day.
I thought you weren't coming in until the holidays? Oh! Mm.
Jenny has something she needs to tell you.
Uh yeah.
This girl, Juliet sharp, called me in Hudson and asked for my help to take Serena down.
Now I know Serena still hates me, so I might have done something like this last year, but not now.
Well, Serena has filled me in, and luckily, Juliet's reign is over now that she's failed to get Serena kicked out of Columbia.
Well, I don't know.
Um, she said she was gonna leak a story to page six.
Yeah, I-I'm sorry.
If I thought she was serious, I would've come to you sooner.
Um, she also said that she knew more and she wasn't afraid to use it.
Thank you, Jenny.
You did the right thing.
And I will take it from here.
Okay.
Well I know you have to get back to M.
O.
M.
A.
and your abstract expressionism day with mom, but it's been nice having you, even for a minute.
Thanks, dad.
Mm.
Mm.
Mmm.
Bye.
Yeah, everything's in place on my end.
Vanessa has the boys set, too.
Looks like Serena will finally get what she deserves.
Well, maybe I miss the Upper East Side after all.
Watch out, S.
Looks like Brooklyn finally has a team again.
And this time, they brought in a ringer.
It is so nice to see you again, Anne.
You, too, Blair.
You know, even though things didn't work out with you and Nathaniel, I've remained impressed with you, which is why you were the first person I thought of to replace me as the face of the girls inc.
Foundation.
I'd be honored to carry on your philanthropic tradition.
But I feel I need to tell you the board is very focused on the fact that the head of a female empowerment organization needs to be someone who's empowered herself.
Well, they're in luck, because power isn't just my mission, it's my mantra.
It's more Your personal relationships that are in question.
I assume you don't mean Nate.
So I took your advice about the relaunch.
After tonight, it will be clear I'm back in the game with Victrola, gimlet, and the empire as my flagship.
Yeah, but a black and white ball? It's so Hilton Conrad, not Paris.
I take your insult as flattering.
Well, don't.
People aren't checking into the empire for a black-tie experience.
They come to live like Chuck Bass No rules, no repercussions.
They still can.
The hotel is the same as ever.
But you aren't.
When you disappeared, you seriously damaged your brand, and the hotel has paid the price.
People do change.
Not that I know if Chuck has, since I rarely associate with him anymore.
So what do you suggest? If you want to rebuild, you need to commit to being the hedonist everyone loves to hate.
No one wants a soft-hearted has-been who's worried about dating Blair Waldorf.
Trust me, a relationship with Blair is the furthest thing from my mind.
People may forgive the choices you've made in your past.
But if you want this foundation in your future, I'll need some assurance that Charles won't be a part of it.
He's not even part of my present.
You were right.
Lily has requested a meeting.
Trust me, nothing drives a wedge between mother and daughter more than Lily trying to cover up for Serena.
Why hide your talents in Hudson? I didn't wanna cross any more lines trying to defend myself against Blair.
But When you told me they went after Vanessa at the ballet, I had to help.
Blair's pathological for sure, but half of what she does is to protect Serena.
And she never pays consequences or takes responsibility.
Which is exactly why we need to turn everyone against Serena, so she finally knows what it feels like to be an outsider.
Well, I'd say you're pretty expert at this yourself.
I just like visual aides.
Uh, Nate and Dan are friends again? Mm-hmm.
Great, so we just need to get Serena's phone.
I already did one better.
I replaced her SIM card with a new one, and I put all her contacts in so she can call out, but this phone has her actual SIM so we get all her incoming calls and texts.
And we can send whatever responses we want, and she'll never know because her phone's not even missing.
You know, if you stuck around here, we would all be working for you in a week.
Okay, so you guys wait for incoming calls, and I am gonna go meet Lily.
I've been rethinking dinner.
I read a few more reviews, and the crowds are big, and the portions are small.
I read the same thing.
Why waste our time on mediocrity? Where exactly did you read that? I assume the same place you did.
I didn't! I lied because Anne Archibald doesn't want the face of her foundation to be associated with Chuck Bass.
What's your excuse? K.
C.
thinks you're too good for my bad reputation, and it's hurting business.
Well, we can't very well risk our futures for some meaningless dinner.
Even if it would be wrong to assume we're anything more than old acquaintances sharing a side of spinach.
Why take the risk? I'll see you at your place.
Is now too soon? Don't look at me like that.
You're the one who's black and white and read all over.
How do you think that happened? A secret relationship.
But Chuck and I are not in a relationship.
What are you, a foot fetishist? They're done.
B.
, come on.
You and Chuck have way too much history to interact in a casual way.
I just don't want to see you get hurt or lose this opportunity with Anne.
I won't, as long as I keep my heart locked away and our interactions off the street.
As for your devoted suitors, have you finally decided on whom to crush? No, and I have feelings for both, and I don't want to hurt either.
I have a whole new appreciation for "Big Love.
" Well, even in Utah, only the men get to have more than one spouse, which, I've come to realize, is extremely sexist.
You should add it to the Girls Inc.
agenda.
But seriously, B.
, what am I supposed to do? And please don't say make a list, because Eric and Elliot already tried that.
Lists are for kids.
Dilemmas like these require a meditative state.
I find mine by watching Dorota feed the ducks.
You can borrow her as long as she's back by dinner.
Thank you, but ducks and Dorota couldn't compare to the zen of shopping.
So go forth to Madison and seek out the perfect dress, and then follow your heart to the perfect guy.
Okay, sensei.
I actually have to get something for the black and white ball tonight, so I have nothing to lose.
But remember, when it comes to Chuck, you do.
All right, so it's decided.
We'll each invite her on a best date ever, something that's true to who we are, shows her why we're the right guy.
Oh, so you're gonna take to her to one of those weird movies that doesn't make sense even No, I'm gonna take her to Frankie's 457.
She'll feel like she discovered something new, a place where no one cares if she's Serena Van Der Woodsen.
Aw, dude.
I won already.
Why, 'cause you're gonna go make her watch you play lacrosse? She loves lacrosse, especially when it's followed by dinner at per se, and everyone we grew up with was talking about how perfect we are together.
All right, you're on, for tonight, before Chuck's party.
Done.
And whoever she says "yes" to is the guy she wants, never, never to be discussed or debated again.
Okay.
Hey, don't worry.
I'm not one of those winners who rubs it in the loser's face, okay? Okay? Seriously, how many times can Blair text that she knows she's being paranoid but she just wants to make sure that Serena isn't going after Anne Archibald's foundation? Well, we should write back and thank her for giving us exactly the information we needed.
Oh, this is perfect.
Dan and Nate both invited her out tonight.
And Serena's gonna reject both of them, but only after she toys with them enough to make them hate her, at least for tonight.
As much as I find K.
C.
personally abhorrent, she's right about black and white.
It's decent rather than decadent.
Did you have something more devious in mind? Saints and sinners has a nice feel.
There is something alluring about an angel drawn to the dark side.
Or a devil redeemed.
? 443 00:19: Mmm.
Mmm, where inhibitions can't help but break free.
I'll let K.
C.
and Gossip Girl know.
Now How to impress Anne with your virtue? I could denounce your unseemly party.
At a tasteful dinner, in front of the whole board.
Of course, no one does black like Dior.
I appreciate the tea, Mrs.
Humphrey, but I'm not really sure why I'm here.
Well, I knew you had a problem with Serena when you tried to keep her out of Hamilton house, but it's come to my attention that you are also responsible for page six.
Yes, well, I guess that's the thing when you're not born with a silver spoon in your mouth.
You wanna eat, you have to work.
Yes, and it seems that you've made a career out of harassing my daughter.
Serena and Colin are over.
Do not continue to jeopardize her future.
I won't mention Colin's name again, I swear If only he were the only teacher Serena had an inappropriate relationship with.
I'm not sure what you're referring to.
Oh, I'm pretty sure that you are.
Something like that does not go down without a parent knowing.
I mean, boarding school? Serena was a minor.
Anyway, knowing that it's a pattern Might help dean Reuther find her grounds for expulsion.
So how much will it take for you to leave my daughter alone? Oh, I don't know.
This design is brilliant, and I have nothing like it.
But that one I could wear everywhere.
How is this better than venn diagrams? Maybe I should get both.
I-I thought the point was to choose.
Attention, party people Bass' black and white has added some fire and ice.
Whether you're a saint or a sinner, the afterlife never looked so good.
Great.
Now neither of these will work.
Should I be a saint or a sinner? No.
Dan vs.
Nate was hard enough.
I am not touching good vs.
bad, Serena.
We'll see you later.
We should go as Bacchus and Sergius.
Yes, we should.
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.
I'm not so sure white's your color.
What are you doing here? I assume you mean, how can a poor girl like me afford anything in a place like this? You only have yourself to blame for Colin cutting you off.
Luckily, I have a new benefactor.
I think you know her.
Lily Van Der Woodsen? Bass? Humphrey? What is her last name? Oh, you know what? I can just look at the check.
My mom already called the "Post.
" Page six is printing a retraction.
Why would she give you anything? I guess she didn't want the whole world to know you other secret.
What a shame for everyone to find out what an embarrassment it is to have you as a daughter.
Hmm.
Hey, uh, you don't happen to be at the loft with a blonde we don't talk about.
I'm here.
Serena's not.
Did you need me to leave before she gets here? No, no, no.
I was expecting her here at the park anyway.
I just I thought maybe my loft was the only place she knew in Brooklyn.
Thanks anyway.
* Serena's not there waiting for me, is she? Why would she be? I thought you scared her off with your heartfelt declarations.
No, she was supposed to meet me at the Frick.
I don't know what happened.
We must've had some miscommunication.
They do seem to be your area of expertise.
In fact, you've probably said your share of inappropriate things during intercourse.
So what'd you do? Did you call a girl by another girl's name? Talk a little too dirty? It's not funny.
I may have uttered those three little words that change everything.
But she probably didn't even hear me.
Scientifically speaking, intense pleasure does dull the other senses.
Relax, man.
Girls know that when a guy says that during s*x, it doesn't mean "I love you.
" It means, "I love having s*x with you.
" Of course.
Thanks.
For Mrs.
Archibald and the ladies, I ordered Petrossian caviar and blini for appetizer.
Why would you do that? You know Mr.
Chuck loves caviar.
But but you love, too.
E-everyone loves Okay, fine, Dorota.
Since you badgered it out of me, yes, it's true.
Chuck said he loved me while in a compromising position.
He did? He did.
Oh, this is just like in book when time traveler comes to declare love for lost princess.
Yes, but unlike your dirty, long-haired Lothario, Chuck probably didn't mean it.
He simply blurted it out in the height of passion.
But Mr.
Chuck does not seem like blurter.
Well, he's obviously become one, and I did the polite thing and acted like I didn't hear.
You didn't say "I love you" back? And be a weak, sniveling, "stand by your man" who never runs a foundation or anything else? No! I am an empowered woman, and I won't let three words that were probably meaningless change that.
This is obviously distracting you from your work.
Did you pay Juliet off? Uh, Bruce, let me call you back.
If you mean, did I ask Juliet to stop leaking information to page six? The answer is yes.
You never believed that I didn't sleep with Colin, did you? You just said that to the dean so that I could stay at Columbia.
I wanted you to be able to move forward and focus on your future.
What did she even say she has? What's important is that it's taken care of.
She has nothing because I did nothing.
So you believe her over me? You know, you just let yourself get blackmailed for no reason.
Can you blame me? It's not like you have a history of great decision making.
How can I when you disapprove of every choice I've ever made? No matter how hard I try to do the right thing, you always just assume the worst.
Lobster potpie, cheesecake in a jar, and John Delucie! Chuck asked me to make sure everything was perfect.
Chuck did this? So romantic, like in book when time traveler sends sign of true love from future, and princess needs to get to grand ball where he is waiting.
And if she too late, the rift in the time-space continuum close up forever.
Miss Blair? Uh, we have mixed company.
Tell Anne and the board that I've been delayed.
And unless you want to raise Ana in Poland, don't let them leave before I get back.
Where you going? Mm.
Straight to hell with all the other sinners.
Hey, what are you doing here? We agreed to let this go after the text.
Yeah, I know, and she texted me that she'd meet me, only she stood me up.
I'm guessing she did the same thing to you.
Yeah.
What are you guys doing here? This is really not a good time.
Yeah, and obviously you're not gonna end this, so we are.
You know how we both feel.
You have until midnight to decide.
Eric just texted Serena to see how she's doing after the blow-out with her mom and to make sure she's still on for dinner.
Now the only one left is Blair.
Anne Archibald's foundation board members at dinner.
Tell them that Serena would like to be considered for the position.
What do I do if Blair sees me? Lie.
Looks like the battle between Brooklyn and the Upper East Side had finally come to a head.
Word has it lonely boy and golden boy both declared their love.
They gave Cinderella until midnight to decide.
That Carolina Herrera dress makes her look like an angel, but this decision is demonic I can't believe it.
Dan and Nate will forgive her anything.
How do we keep her from making a choice? We don't.
We make it for her.
Take off your clothes and take out your credit card.
And the forces of evil are just getting started.
I should've known taking down Serena involved wearing the perfect dress.
Well, anytime I can combine styling with revenge Plus, this isn't exactly my first masquerade party.
I'll see you inside.
Good luck, man.
Yeah, you, too.
Serena Van Der Woodsen.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
That should keep Serena out long enough for us to make her life hell.
She's here.
I just spotted her.
Now you just need to figure out a way to get the board meeting moved here.
I don't think these ladies wanna witness Chuck's eternal damnation.
Tell Anne that Blair's arranged a special surprise to show her dedication to girls inc.
And, Vanessa, you really need to start showing more initiative.
Jenny's carrying you on this thing.
I know.
Hey! Serena, have you seen Chuck? Wait! I know that you don't think you my being with him is a good idea, but you have bad ideas all the time.
I don't wanna lose the foundation, but what's wrong with wanting to keep it secret just long enough to find out how he really feels? I didn't approve of your thing with Colin, but at least I had the decency to talk to you about it.
Well, I didn't, but you should! I know it's not my bolognese.
No, Rufus.
I'm sorry.
It's delicious.
I'm just I'm just upset about this Serena situation.
I thought we'd all moved on.
And Serena broke things off with Colin.
The "Post" is apologizing.
The dean can't force Serena out of school.
And by next semester, this whole thing will be forgotten.
Well, it'd be a lot easier if Colin was the first teacher that Serena had been involved with.
Really? Someone at Constance? Boarding school.
Boarding school? Serena was just a kid.
Serena was never a kid.
Believe me.
This was after the Shepherd wedding, Pete Fairman It didn't end well.
I was lucky I found a way to handle it.
Well, just because it happened then doesn't mean it's happening now.
Hey.
Listen, I'm sorry for laying it on the line like that earlier.
It's just Serena, you have no idea the hell you've put me through.
It is me, right? So you ready? As hard as it's gonna be, I-I know what I have to do.
Hi.
Uh, Eric and Serena Van Der Woodsen and Elliot Leichter.
Go on in.
What was that name again? Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought he told you.
Serena Van Der Woodsen.
Nice try, but she's already inside.
Well, that's a mistake because I'm her.
Sorry.
Do you have I.
D.
? I didn't come to rent a car.
Everyone here knows me.
Eric, can you get Chuck or K.
C.
? And hurry, please.
I don't want to keep them waiting.
Serena! Hey, there you are.
Excellent.
That that was a Kiss hello, right? Not a kiss good-bye? I think I might need another to be sure.
Are are you gonna tell Nate? Let him know I'm, uh, I'm sorry.
I mean, not sorry enough to want you to change your mind, but I avoided K.
C.
's prying eyes.
I appreciate that, and you being here half-dressed.
But don't you have a denouncement to attend? Dorota's distracting the board with Delucie's cavatelli until I get back.
I heard what you said.
What conversation are you referring to exactly? Three one syllable words that, under the circumstances, you may or may not have meant.
Do you want me to have meant them? If they were true, I would want to know.
Of course.
* They bark and scream out for God and their mothers.
Well I should get back to Anne.
I meant it, Blair With all my heart.
You gonna say something this time? I will.
I-I mean I do.
You realize we can't have everything.
Anne won't be the only person who might think you're weak for forgiving me.
And you won't build a business based on being New York's bad boy bachelor.
I understand the consequences.
Are you willing to pay them? Serena, what are you doing?! Looks like saints and sinners aren't the only ones battling for souls tonight.
What say we go up in flames together? It's no surprise C.
and B.
succumbed to the dark side.
But how about the boys from opposite sides of the bridge? It's hard to get word when they're both lip-locked with Serena Van Der Woodsen.
Lucky I have the pictures to prove it.
Anne? I can explain.
I'm not sure how this shows your dedication to girls inc.
You know, you lost any sympathy I may have had for your previous choices the moment I saw you kissing Charles in your underwear.
Shouldn't empowered women get to have relationships, too? Being with Chuck doesn't make me less Blair.
I'm sorry, but it does.
The man you're with may not be a reflection of you, but you will always be a reflection of him.
That's not fair.
Maybe not, but the sooner you accept it, the easier your decisions will be.
And please tell Serena while I appreciate her interest in the position, she's not the type of girl we're looking for either.
At least she was polite.
I doubt we'll have that with K.
C.
Give me a minute.
I have to go find Serena.
How could I have kissed either of you when I couldn't even get into the party? So someone dressed exactly like you, wearing your perfume, just happened to be attracted to both of us? I-I don't know.
I-I can't explain it.
So this mystery person texted us from Paris, too? And used us to make some adjunct professor jealous and stood us up? No, I am partially responsible for this.
I came here tonight to tell you how I felt.
Doesn't that count for more than a "Gossip Girl" blast? We can't keep chasing you in circles.
You didn't make the choice.
We made it for you.
I didn't do this.
I'm with him.
So good-bye, Serena.
B.
, you know I didn't kiss both of them.
Do I? It's no worse than what you did to me and Chuck.
What? I had nothing to do with you coming here in your underwear.
You knew what you had to lose.
I kept trying to figure out why you would expose us.
And then Anne Archibald told me that you wanted to be the face of her foundation.
Oh, come on.
When are you gonna give it up? I don't want everything that you want.
I couldn't be less interested.
So Anne, Nate, and Dan are all liars? That's a lot of people to blame, even for you.
Just admit you did the wrong thing, or maybe you don't even know what that is anymore.
You know, you're not the first person to say that today, so I guess it must be true.
You know, it was a bad choice thinking that you'd be on my side.
Not as bad as my believing that you'd ever be happy for my success.
Hey.
Whoa, Serena.
Hey, don't run off.
Why not? Mom's not the only one who still sees me as a messed-up 16-year-old.
No one can see that I've changed.
No one cares.
I-I care.
You're my little brother.
You're not enough.
Oh.
You're just in time to hear K.
C.
tell me how I've destroyed my bad boy business plan once and for all.
I warned you, but it turns out I was wrong.
This party is so decadent and in the private rooms, frankly, illegal.
The big romantic gesture showed the hedonist has a heart.
So Blair's the perfect balance? With the press this will get, you can expect the hotel will be fully booked by Monday.
I'm already getting calls for personal appearances.
In fact, I would love to get you some photo ops.
You know, Chuck Bass' girlfriend at store openings, fashion shows, that kind of thing.
Call me and we'll schedule.
It appears the rules are there to be broken.
We can have everything.
No, you can.
It's me who can't.
Hey, hey.
It's okay.
Come on.
I got you.
In the battle between good and evil, score one for the sinners.
Hi.
Sorry.
My friend's had a little bit too much to drink.
Looks like S.
could end up the next saintly sacrifice.
Pleasant dreams, sweet angel.
I'll give you the money to start whatever foundation you want.
It won't change anything.
Anne's right.
As long as I'm with you, I'm Hillary in the White House, and I wanna be Hillary secretary of state, but with better hair.
Then you'll find another way to show the world you're a force to be reckoned with.
We'll build our futures together.
I followed my heart all last year and it led me nowhere.
Now I need to follow my head.
You don't need to choose between them.
Look at Brad and Angelina.
They takes turns on top.
Yeah, but she won an Oscar first.
I'm sorry, but I have to be Blair Waldorf before I can be Chuck Bass' girlfriend.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I don't expect you to wait.
If two people are meant to be together, eventually they'll find their way back.
Do you really believe that? I do.
So do I.
Still no Juliet? No.
But I gotta get back to Hudson before my luck runs out and I run smack into Blair and my dad.
Well, it was nice to finally win one for team Brooklyn.
You sure you can't stay and celebrate? I can try texting Juliet again.
* * That's the thing about destiny.
Instead of too many choices, you suddenly have none.
The prince of darkness finally sees the light, only to realize it's no longer an option And the time for love has come and gone.
Well, not to sound like a high school cheerleader, but I-I-I'm glad we were in this together.
You're not hot enough to be a high school cheerleader, but me, too.
Otherwise, I'd probably be looking for a reason to blame you.
And you did make a damn good scapegoat.
Hey, you wanna go play red dead redemption? One ground rule, though.
One.
Serena Van Der Woodsen does not exist.
Perfect.
The rest of us just have to keep moving forward Yes, of course.
I understand.
She's over 18.
Y-well, thank you for your call.
That was dean Reuther.
Your sister just withdrew from Columbia.
Alienate everybody, drop out of school, run away That sounds like Serena.
You're right.
I'm not sure there's anything we can do anymore.
Accept the choice is out of your hands.
It's up to the fates to decide.

I gave up on your mother visiting a long time ago.
Just wish she could see how great you're doing now.
You tried to destroy my friendship with blair, My reputation, my academic career.
So who much will it take for you to leave my daughter alone? I could really use some help from the inside right now.
What exactly did you have in mind? We need to turn everyone against serena.
(serena) how could I have kissed either of you When I couldn't even get into the party? So someone dressed exactly like you just happened to be Attracted to both of us? (serena) I-I don't know.
I can't explain it.
Mom's not the only one who still sees me As a messed-up 16-year-old.
(lily) your sister just withdrew from columbia.
Alienate everybody, drop out of school, run away-- That sounds like serena.

Fixed by yamia (gossip girl) thanksgiving-- my favorite holiday.
As always, I'll be spending it giving thanks For the bounty of secrets I've harvested from you this year.
But leave a place for me at your table.
I'll be back for just desserts.
Strolling the christmas markets with daddy and roman, Celebrating beaujolais nouveau at le tambour.
Did you remember my new burberry? Yes.
That's the double-faced.
I need the shearling.
Do you want me to freeze? Yes.
I want you to freeze.
Why aren't you excited for me? You know how much I love paris in autumn.
With everything that's happened with mr.
Chuck and miss serena, I also know that you want to get out of the dodge.
Out of Dodge.
It's a place, not a pickup truck, And I'm not leaving because of them.
Well, not entirely because of them.
It's ana's first holiday season.
So many traditions to share-- The breaking of opatek, The waiting for first star, The singing koldy.
Do any of these traditions include getting to the point? I took liberty of making Harold's famous thanksgiving pie for you.
I'm not sure that's getting through airport security.
I thought we could drop it off at van der woodsens' On your way to airport.
Serena is the one who forced chuck and me into the open And tried going after my committee.
She's the one staying at lily's to avoid me.
Shouldn't she be bringing me pies? (blows raspberry) Forget I mention it.
I'll throw pie in trash.
No.
Ugh.
It's fine.
But this is only about pies and traditions.
That's all.
Do they have a word in polish for "pain in the ass"? (mackintosh braun) this was made for us  zawracanie gowy (horns honk) We have relatives I don't know about? It's always a possibility.
Your mother wanted to pull out all the stops this year.
So this is about, uh, denial.
Have you heard from serena? No.
She hasn't responded to any of my texts.
And, granted, most of them included angry emoticons, But, uh, I was actually thinking of going over to blair's now To try to talk to her.
You will do no such thing.
Come on, lil.
It's the holidays.
She dropped out of college.
She refuses to return our phone calls.
She's a grown woman throwing temper tantrums Just to punish me.
When she is ready to take responsibility For her actions, we'll talk.
Until then, you know what? I'm done being punished.
You know, and everything looks so great.
Maybe just move the, uh, flowers a little closer.
Hmm.
How could they not have pumpkin pie? We're at foragers market.
I'm sure we'll find something.
How about the organic pumpkin tarts with gluten-free crust? (scoffs) do I look like I could have baked those? I told my dad I would.
You know how he loves his tradition.
Maybe you can tell him the new tradition Is being truthful about the origin Of thanksgiving dessert.
How about you come and tell him yourself? He told me He invited you but you weren't sure if you were coming? Well, I wasn't sure if you wanted me to.
Yeah, I-I do.
I mean, if it weren't for you, I would have let serena destroy my friendship with nate.
Friendships are important.
I saw the blast about what she did at saints and sinners.
Have you spoken to her since that happened? Nope.
Not planning to.
Neither is nate.
Kissing both of us proves that she doesn't care About either of us, so we're just trying to Move on, now really think about it.
How's that working out for ya? Pretty poorly, thank you, which is why I could-- I could really use you there today if she does come, So What do you say? Do I have time to run back to the loft? I have this amazing tofu sage stuffing recipe.
For tofu? How could I say no? I was gonna swing by before we left for grandfather's, If that's still okay with you.
Of course.
Can't wait.
Just you? She just needs more time, dad.
Well Time I got lots of.
Tell your mom I said happy thanksgiving.
She'll come around, I promise.
It's just, uh, it'd be great to see her, you know? I'd love the chance to talk to her So she could see for herself just how much I've changed.
Let me talk to her.
I'll see you soon, okay? Yeah.
(men shouting in distance) Mr.
Stahl, what are you doing here? Nathaniel.
Just, uh, dropping off some papers for your mother.
Well, on thanksgiving? Yes.
Well, they're time-sensitive.
(horn honks) You know what? She's She's not in right now.
Oh.
She's getting her hair done, so I can give that to her.
Uh Well Okay.
Thanks.
Happy thanksgiving.
Have a good one.
You, too.
(elevator bell dings) What are you doing here? Thanksgiving-- the only day of the year It's acceptable to eat dinner before 8:00.
Oh.
Of course.
Right.
Thanksgiving.
We bring pie.
I should have asked lily if you were coming.
I can leave if you'd like.
Don't be silly.
I was just headed to j.
F.
K.
But even if I wasn't, We should get used to little run-ins like these.
I mean, if bruce and demi cod do it, It can't be that difficult.
Oh.
Blair, dorota.
What are you doing here? Just bringing a little tradition.
Aw.
(chuckles) I'm spending the holidays with daddy and roman in paris.
I figured since we usually spend this day together, That, you know Um, is serena here? We thought she was with you.
No, I haven't seen her since chuck's party.
She never came home.
Okay.
All right.
Now I'm worried.
Charles? (chuck) she's not at the empire.
Well, then where the hell is she? (the limianas' "down underground" playing) (singing in french)  (shatters)  (telephone rings) (man) 9-1-1.
What is your emergency? My name is serena van der woodsen.
I don't know where I am or how I got here.
Please help.
Hey, man, I just got your text.
What's up? My mom's filing for divorce.
At least she's trying to.
Oh.
I'm--I'm sorry, man.
That sucks.
What am I supposed to do? You know, how do I-- how do I stop this? You can't.
I know it's not what you want to hear, but if kids Could fix their parents' relationships, they would.
Hell, if we could fix our own relationships, we would.
That's your advice? Do nothing? No.
I mean, if it helps, I know my parents are happier now than they were.
And don't take this the wrong way, But I mean, it can't come as a total shock, right? It is.
I mean, she's had years to do this.
The guy embezzled.
He got arrested.
He tried to skip bail, and then he went to prison.
She stayed married to him this whole time, And now she wants out? (sighs) I mean, what's worse is that I feel he's--he's really changed.
I just-- I gotta get her to see that.
Well, good luck.
Thanks, man.
Actually, no.
No, thanks.
Your advice sucked.
(cell phone rings) (chuckles) I'm sorry.
Hold on a second.
Hey.
Uh, hey, dad.
I'm at nate's right now, But vanessa should be there soon, though I should warn you, There is, uh, stuffing with tofu involved.
I hate to do this to you over the phone, But, um, I need to tell you something, And I prefer to keep it in the immediate family for now.
Serena's in the hospital.
Is everything okay? We hope so.
We're at st.
Margaret's.
All right, well, I'm close.
I'll be there soon.
No.
I understand, but when will we be allowed to see her? No one's telling us anything.
Well, just be patient, And someone will be with you soon.
Okay? Let us know when you can! Blair (alexi murdoch) the water  is so cold  and heavy on my mind  All they could tell us is what we already know.
She dialed 9-1-1 from a motel in queens And that drugs were involved.
What are we supposed to do? For now (sighs) just be here when she wakes up.
I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee.
looking for a rose  (beep) (cell phone chiming) (sighs) Hi, dad.
What's, uh, going on? Hey, sweetie, I wish I didn't have to tell you this, But Serena's in the hospital.
Looks like an overdose.
Oh, my god.
What-- We're hoping she's gonna be fine.
If it's okay with your mom, I'd really like you here with us.
I know you and serena have a complicated past, But at the end of the day-- No, no, uh, of course.
I'll get there soon as I can.
Dad, can Just tell lily how sorry I am.
I'm sure she'll appreciate that.
oh, the ice is stirring  and spring is  Hello? Is anyone home? (whispering) hi, hi, hi.
Dorota.
Shh.
(lowers voice) what are you doing here? (lowered voice) holding down fort.
Why? Where is everyone? Maybe you should call mr.
Humphrey.
(cell phone ringing) (ana fusses) though  I'm not yet gone  (phone rings) Hey, this is dan.
Leave a message.
Let me make a call, See if one of my doctors can get us some answers.
Thanks.
Where is she? Is she all right? What happened? She overdosed in some cheap motel in queens, alone.
Why didn't she come to me? I mean, no matter how angry we were at each other, she knows.
I don't know what I would do if anything happened to her.
What do the doctors say? Rufus and lily are waiting to talk to them.
What? Drugs in a cheap motel-- That does not sound like serena to me.
Sometimes I forget How much of a recent addition you are, humphrey.
You met her as a girl coming home, trying to start over.
I wish it wasn't true, but Sounds a lot like the serena I used to know.
Mrs.
Humphrey? I'm dr.
Keller.
It was a drug overdose, but it wasn't severe.
We have her on fluids right now, But her liver and kidneys look fine.
Ohh.
Uh, what now? Well, she's stable, so soon as she wakes up, We'll have to discharge her.
I was wondering if you wanted To discuss a place for her recovery.
I understand your family had a good experience With the ostroff center.
Well, she's not a drug addict, and she didn't mean To harm herself.
This was all sort of a stupid mistake, And as you said yourself, it wasn't severe.
The amount ingested isn't what worries me.
In addition to the painkillers and sleeping pills, We found nortriptyline in her motel room.
It's an antidepressant, but taken in conjunction With the other medications, it can be fatal.
Was your daughter battling depression? No.
Uh, not that we're aware of.
(lowers voice) I'll give you a minute.
Thank you.
Do you think she was taking something and not telling us? I don't know.
This was serena acting out, blowing off steam Like she always does.
It just went too far.
That's all.
Looking for this? Any other earth-shattering news You plan on having delivered today? You opened it? You're honestly gonna make this about me Not respecting your privacy? Mom, you're not even giving him a chance.
I mean, after everything that he's been through-- Everything he's been through.
What about what I've been through? I'm sorry, But your father walked away from us Long before he went to prison.
But he's there now, and he's changed.
The only thing that's changed is he's two years Into his sentence, and he's starting to see The light at the end of the tunnel.
That's not true, and if you talked to him, You wouldn't feel that way.
Mom, please.
Just come see him with me.
I mean, don't you owe him at least that? We need to be at your grandfather's by 6:00.
You can see your father tomorrow.
(indistinct conversations, telephone ringing in distance) We saw you talking to the doctors.
How is she? When can we see her? Doctor thinks it might be a good idea For serena to get some help.
What kind of help? Oh, my god.
They don't think she did this on purpose, do they? No.
No one's saying that.
(blair) but there's a chance? Have you made a decision? No.
We need to think.
Here's a crazy suggestion.
Why don't we ask serena and see what she wants? Well, she's not gonna go anywhere but home.
I can tell you that right now.
If you decide she needs treatment, We have grounds to sign off on an involuntary admission.
You can't be serious.
To admit her against her will is wrong.
And if you do that, you're not gonna be able to take it back.
But what if we don't, and it happens again? I-I'm sorry, but I'm scared for her.
It would be different if she never acted out like this, But she has.
It's your choice, lil.
We'll support you, Whatever it is you decide.
Guys? I just want what's best for her.
What if it's the only way for her to move on, get centered? Guys! Well-known manhattan socialite And former party girl serena van der woodsen, Was admitted to st.
Margaret's emergency room After e.
M.
T.
S responded to a 9-1-1 call From a motel in queens.
I don't know where I am or how I got here.
Please help.
Oh, my god.
No stranger to controversy, Ms.
Van der woodsen was recently the focus of There are news vans in the streets.
This place is Gonna be swarming with paparazzi in about five minutes.
So we'll get her out of here, Take her home where she can rest.
No.
I'm sure that they're pitching tents Outside the apartment as we speak.
That's not what she needs.
She needs quiet.
She needs safe.
Mrs.
Humphrey, your daughter is waking up now.
Would you like to see her? Ostroff center.
And if she doesn't wanna go? Involuntary hold? Yes.
Now.
Okay.
Spacious.
Your room is bigger than mine was.
How you feeling? Betrayed, thanks.
Serena, I know right now-- Mom, stop.
Your daughter wakes up alone, Drugged in an empty motel room, and you don't call the cops, You don't ask if she's okay or what happened.
You just have her committed.
What kind of mother does that? The kind of mother who wants her daughter safe.
Is that what you're telling yourself? That this is what's best for me? Well, serena, this isn't exactly what's best for me.
You know, it would be a lot easier to take you home And act like this never happened.
(sighs) But I'm afraid for you.
How could you let her do this to me? Because I love you.
When I was in here, I didn't wanna be, At least not at first.
I'm not in denial, eric.
I didn't do this.
It took me a long time to come to terms with what I did, too.
(sighs) I'm sorry I didn't tell you when we first found out.
I No, don't worry about it, man.
So what happened? She told the doctor she can't remember anything.
(scoffs) At the party, serena said she didn't kiss either of us, That she had no idea what happened.
And now this.
Now what--what if something else is going on? Or maybe you just wanna think that Because it's easier than the truth.
(cell phone alert chimes, beep) Look, I gotta go.
Uh Just tell serena "hey" for me when you see her, okay? Yeah, sure, of course.
Dan, I care a lot about serena.
I always will.
Whether she realizes it or not, This is how she pulls people back in.
And I'm not gonna let it happen anymore.
Neither should you.
(knock on door) We need to talk.
To my super about letting strangers into my apartment? No, about serena.
Her overdose? I had no idea she was so depressed.
She wasn't, until we made her that way.
I mean, we turned everyone against her--dan, nate, blair.
Anything serena did after she left that party Is not our fault.
Maybe, but we still need to tell her what we did And tell her that we're sorry.
I mean, her mom had her admitted To the ostroff center.
Serena needs to know she's not crazy.
I'm going there now.
Okay, wait.
No matter what we did, Serena still went on a bender and overdosed.
Maybe she needs the help that that center can provide.
Who knows? We may have called attention to a larger problem That could have been much worse.
But promise me that You're not gonna say anything without talking to me first.
Okay.
I gotta go.
(beeping) (knock on door) I see my mom is sending in the big guns.
No, lily didn't send me.
In fact, I don't-- I don't think she's a fan of mine right now.
What happened? Honestly, I don't know, But I really wish I did because then maybe I could Explain it to everyone.
What's the last thing you remember? Like, what do you know for certain? Heading into the party to look for you.
You were the one that I came to kiss.
You and only you.
It's the last thing I'm certain of.
It's The only thing I still am.
Get your stuff.
(cell phone rings) I was just about to call you.
Have you heard from jenny? She just left.
Where are you? I'm heading to the ostroff center After talking to dan.
Oh, good, because jenny's on her way over there now To come clean about what we did.
Well, maybe she should.
I will tell you the same thing that I told her with one caveat.
We are not responsible for what serena did After she left that night.
If jenny wants to come clean, They will forgive her eventually.
(suitcase handle clatters) She's family.
You're not.
You will lose all of them, especially dan.
He will use you as an excuse To go right back to serena, And this time, that's where he'll stay.
If jenny wants to go down for something that we didn't do, Then that's her call, But she goes down alone.
(beep) (cell phone thuds) (inhales and exhales deeply) There you are.
I thought I'd go pick her up some comfort food from e.
A.
T.
Do you wanna come up? Sure, I guess.
I'm glad that we can be here together for serena.
I'd like to know that when push comes to shove, Maybe nothing has to change between us.
(footsteps approach) Blair.
Dad, I came as soon as I-- Sorry.
I had to tell him what you did to serena.
What I did? Vanessa told me she overheard How you were gonna turn everyone against serena.
That's the real reason you came back-- To teach her some kind of a lesson? Well, you sure did.
Are you proud of yourself? Rufus, I can't believe what just happened.
(sighs) What's wrong? It's serena.
She's gone.
To relieve five major symptoms, What could possibly hold together All the natural energy found in peanuts? Caramel works.
Payday.
Crunchy roasted peanuts and soft chewy caramel Come together to give you sweet energy.
Payday.
The sweet taste of energy.
Time to head in? Yeah, but you have another visitor joining you first.
I'll be right back to get you.
Mom.
When you didn't show up at the car, I thought long and hard about what you said.
I'm not making any promises, but at the very least, I should hear your father out before I end things.
What changed your mind? We made a ton of mistakes in our marriage, But you weren't one of them.
If my son is asking me to do this, Then I need to try.
And, uh, grandfather's thanksgiving? It'll be nice to make him wait.
No one ever does.
(chuckles) How do I look? You look great.
All right, why don't you grab some food, Whatever you can for the trip? I'm gonna get some, uh, clothes and toiletries.
Okay.
We got some, um, apples, but they're squishy and brown.
Uh, cereal Not much else except some old milk And tofu, if you like that, which you apparently do.
Mm, no, that's vanessa.
Where is she? That's a good question.
You know, there's a bodega by the bus station.
Come on.
I bust you out of the loony bin.
You're gonna mock my choice of transportation? We're fugitives, all right? We're taking the bus.
Are we really doing this-- just running away together? No, running away is what guilty people do.
We're just getting out of the city for a few days To get some space and clear your head.
It's a It's a vacation.
A vacation? I like that.
Hey.
Thank you for believing in me.
How can I not? There you are.
Both of you.
I didn't wanna get into it in front of everyone, But now it's your turn to face the music.
(sighs) maybe I did try to trick serena At the saints and sinners party, but I didn't do it alone, And we didn't mean for it to end up like this.
"we"? Yes, me, juliet, and vanessa-- we were all in it together.
That's not what vanessa said.
What, are you gonna believe her more than me? Jenny, I'm not gonna argue with you About how responsible you are.
One-third, two-thirds.
You can't deny you did it, and I am not vanessa And juliet's father.
I'm yours.
Serena could have died.
I know! Dad, I know.
(voice breaks) I'm sorry! I It was supposed to be a prank to teach her a lesson.
I never should have come back to the city.
Well, on that we can both agree.
Then I guess there's no reason for me to stay.
Jenny, where are you going? You can spare me whatever you rehearsed On the way over.
I'm not going back.
Even if it's what's best for you? You don't get a vote.
I can't believe you took her side.
Serena-- Look, call whoever you need to call, but the only way I'm going back there is in a straitjacket.
Dan, you stay here for just a moment.
(door creaks) You may not agree with every decision I make regarding My daughter's well-being, but you have no right To intervene.
I am her mother.
I know her much better than you do, And I have been there for certain parts of her life That you have no idea about.
Really? Which parts are those? Because from the way serena tells it, It sounds like I've clocked more hours by her side Than you have.
Look, I love you.
You know that.
And you have a big heart just like your father, And just like him, you tend to see the good in everyone, No matter what they do.
No, not always.
She's not just the beautiful teenage girl You saw at some party anymore.
She's a troubled young woman, Avoiding some very real consequences.
And unless you wanna help her deal with those, Then I suggest you step out of the way so that I can.
With all due respect, Maybe I am only seeing the good in serena, But--but I'm at least looking at her and not at myself.
And what is that supposed to mean? You committed her because you don't wanna deal with her.
You--you don't even wanna talk to her.
Why? (sighs) Well, maybe I'm afraid of what she might say.
Maybe (gulps) what she did was a cry for help (voice breaking) and I'm the only one who can hear it.
Well, I I don't know, but if that is the case, You should know, and if it's not, Then we really should find out what happened, But regardless, the only way to find out Is to--is to sit and talk.
What makes you think I wanna talk to you any more than her? Do you remember when I had my problem? And I never wanted to go to dr.
Sherman? So you would walk me and wait outside the building To make sure that I went in, And an hour later you'd be standing there to walk me home, No questions asked.
If it wasn't for you, I'd never have gotten better.
Except I don't need to get better.
I didn't do anything.
So, what? Someone went on a bender and rented a room With your credit card and forced pills down your throat? I know how it sounds.
Good, 'cause it sounds Crazy.
Yeah.
I got that.
(cell phone alert chimes) (sighs) Afternoon, upper east siders.
Were your dinners as filling as mine was? Hope not, because have I got some dessert for you With sugar on top.
Mom, um I'm sorry.
It seems everyone's favorite party girl Fell off the wagon and landed in rehab.
Good luck getting a lohan-dle on things, s.
From the looks of it, You've got a lot to recover from.
Take me back to ostroff.
(knocks on door) Hey.
If I don't remember what happened in this photo, Who knows what else I did that I don't remember? Don't do that to yourself.
Thank you for being the one person who believed in me Even though it turns out you were wrong, too.
I wasn't wrong to believe in you.
I still do.
I always will.
(knock on door) Mom's downstairs.
You ready? (sighs) (door creaks) I really thought I was doing the right thing.
I'm--I'm sorry.
Why don't you come back to the apartment with us? I'm hoping it's where your sister ran off to, And maybe we can turn this thanksgiving around.
Thanks, but I-I-I really need to spend some time alone.
We're around if you change your mind.
Where have you been? I've been trying to contact you.
I was baking you a pumpkin pie with a file inside.
What's up with you? We have a lot to be thankful for.
Saints and sinners went perfectly.
Everyone turned against her.
I even got her to drop out of columbia.
That's great.
W-why didn't you tell me? Because it's serena.
She worms herself out of everything, And I needed to make sure that there was one more nail In her coffin- something that would force Her family and friends to look at her differently Forever.
What did you do? They took serena to st.
Margaret's On a drug overdose.
Oh, my god.
You drugged her? Don't worry.
I don't think there was any permanent damage-- To her health, at least.
(scoffs) that was not part of the plan.
Well, I made it part of the plan.
My financial support, Apartment, columbia, Nate Look, this isn't just about you anymore.
If there is a line that you wouldn't have crossed, You should've told me before I lost everything.
Happy thanksgiving, brother.
You know, I'd never even been to brooklyn Until serena met dan humphrey.
Now I know the drive way too well.
I missed my flight and I forgot to call daddy and roman.
They'll be worried.
I should do that when I get home.
It'll be way too late there now.
We should go back to my place, see what food I have.
Maybe watch a movie? Dorota downloaded a whole bunch of mgm musicals for the plane.
She said it would cheer me up.
I know how much you love cyd charisse.
Blair.
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little bit of a mess right now.
After everything that happened today, The thought of losing serena forever Maybe a part of me is questioning What I said to you last week.
I showed up today for serena.
 What you said was right.
We need to be on our own, figure out where we go from there.
Otherwise, we're just torturing ourselves.
This isn't torturing me.
I can't be your friend right now, As much as I wish I could.
I'm sorry.
I'm not.
I got to spend a little more time with you.
Happy thanksgiving, chuck.
(eminem's "space bound" playing) (door closes) (eminem) nobody knows me, I'm cold  walk down this road all alone  it's no one's fault but my own  it's the path I've chosen to go, frozen as snow  Sorry.
Oh, no, it was me.
don't ask me why I have no love  for these  bloodsucking succubuses, what the Is up with this?  I've tried in this department  but I ain't had no luck with this  it sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be  like trying to start over  I've got a hole in my heart  like some kind of emotional roller coaster  something I won't go on so you toy with my emotions  it's over  Hey, juliet.
See you next week? I'm actually going away for a bit.
and I'm a  I'm a space bound rocket ship, and your heart's the moon  and I'm aiming right at you  right at you  Juliet? 250,000 miles on a clear night in June  Oh, no.
and I'm so lost without you  without you  without you  He's really spent this time getting his life in order, Hasn't he? Uh-huh.
And here I thought all the times he wanted me to come out here, He was up to no good.
I love saying "I told you so.
" Well, you have a right to.
I'm proud of you.
You've always held this family together.
All right.
Well, I'm glad you let me.
I'll see you at grandfather's.
I'm gonna say bye to dad.
Okay.
Maybe tell him the good news? (chuckles) I'll call you a car.
Okay.
(lily sighs) Do you know that once upon a time, Thanksgiving was my favorite holiday? I guess we should know better at this point.
At least serena's safe for now.
Did you find jenny? She texted she was on her way back to her mother's.
(whispers) oh, good.
Listen, lil, I don't totally understand this, But I-I think jenny had something to do With what happened to serena.
(normal voice) well, whatever happened, um, Serena did what she did.
And if anyone should accept responsibility, it's me.
It was my job to raise my daughter To make the right choices when life didn't go as planned, And I failed.
Parenting can only go so far.
And you and I couldn't be any more different In that regard, Yet we both have daughters we can't control.
Hey, what do you say to packing up some of this dinner We never had and, um, Spending the rest of the holiday at ostroff with the family? (cell phone ringing) Oh, my gosh.
Oh! You know what? I have one stop to make, And then I'll meet you there, okay? Absolutely.
(footsteps approaching) How many times do I have to go courtney love on your ass Before you get the message? I don't want you here! The girl in gossip girl's blast isn't serena.
What? It's juliet.
We had a plan to turn everyone against her.
When you and chuck were exposed at his party, that was me.
You? And while I was doing that, juliet was kissing dan and nate.
We were both dressed exactly like serena.
This is from her costume, And it's what she wore in those photos.
That's a pretty tall tale from a not too reliable source.
Blair, what reason do I have to come clean? Like it or not, you know me, And you know that I love a good game as much as the next girl, But I would never want to hurt serena for real.
Juliet did, and she used vanessa and me to do it.
Are you willing to go double agent, Help me bring juliet d I wish I could, but you were right In banishing me.
I thought I could change, and I didn't.
So I think the best thing for me to do is go And stay gone.
Thanksgiving without jenny humphrey What fun would that be? Juliet's apartment's empty.
I'm pretty sure she left town.
Good luck.
(alexi murdoch's "through the dark" playing) (elevator bell dings) During the holidays, We call customary patterns of behavior tradition.
And like any pattern, once established, They are not easily broken.
someone  reaching for me now  Right on time.
I like that.
You couldn't have waited till tomorrow? No, I couldn't.
I assume this will be enough to protect my daughter's history.
reaching for me now  Like we talked about last week, As long as the check arrives every month, The past stays in the past.
Oh, and I heard about serena.
I am so, so sorry.
At least she's getting the help that she needs.
I'm a firm believer in people facing what they've done.
Happy thanksgiving.
someone  Other times, we convince ourselves We can start new traditions Really nice seeing your mother up here after all this time.
Yeah.
Just in time, too, right? Just in time for what? Your father's parole.
He was talking about how much it'll mean to the parole board To hear who he's going home to.
And with your mom by his side, I'm sure he'll get out.
Yeah.
Thanks.
I'll see you later.
Only to realize it wouldn't be a tradition if it changed.
someone  to love  you more than I  I didn't order anything.
 (clank) (cell phone chimes) even with  (alert chimes) my heart  in the way  (beeping)  Mom? Hey, it's me.
I think I'm gonna come home after all.
Can you pick me up? I'm gonna take the last train.
Hey.
Did you find what you needed? Yes.
 Other times, ever things we never realized were traditions Can become one.
Whatever happens from here on out, We'll handle it together, okay? (speaking indistinctly) (lily laughs) But the best kinds of traditions Are the ones that bring people together, Even under the most unlikely of circumstances.
Vanessa? Oh.
Blair.
I owe you an apology.
Juliet may have been behind serena's overdose, And I have no intention of letting it go unavenged.
I need your help to find her and extract a confession.
Are you in? Aren't I about the last person you'd want helping you? You love serena, don't you? So we have something in common.
What do you say we find that bitch And get his little friend here justice? Come together right now.

, gossip girl.
Gossip Girl here, Your one and only source Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
My mom's filing for divorce.
I'd love the chance to talk to her So she could see for herself just how much I've changed.
I should hear your father out.
Really nice seeing your mother up here after all this time.
Yeah.
Just in time, too, right? Just in time for what? Your father's parole.
Serena and colin are over.
Do not continue To jeopardize her future.
If only he were the only teacher Serena had an inappropriate relationship with.
[dan] serena's in the hospital.
Oh, my god.
You drugged her? That was not part of the plan.
Look, this isn't just about you anymore.
I was wondering if you wanted to discuss A place for her recovery.
Ostroff center.
Your daughter wakes up alone, drugged, In an empty motel room, and you just have her committed.
Juliet may have been behind serena's overdose.
What do you say we find that bitch And get us a little frontier justice? Serena Seeks Support And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

, gossip girl.
Spotted--dan and blair exiting sant ambroeus With espresso doppio for two, but we hear it's not The caffeine that's got them talking a mile a minute.
It's a mission.
So juliet dressed up like serena At saints and sinners to destroy her relationships With me and nate.
And enlists vanessa and jenny to mess with me.
Which is devious and pathetic, but let's face it, Around here, it's just another Saturday night.
Well, you can't show up at a masked ball and not expect At least one social-climbing doppelganger To try and impersonate you.
But then, according to jenny, juliet posted a photo of herself As serena doing coke.
And for that, she will be judged by a higher power, but we've-- We've seen worse.
Well, I was gonna say "done worse," but yes.
Okay, but then Serena wakes up in a motel room After almost o.
D.
Ing.
And that is where the "juliet express" Goes off the rails and heads straight for crazytown.
The next thing we know, serena wakes up, Insists she didn't go on a bender.
But then the photo shows up online, and she starts To doubt herself and checks herself into the ostroff, Which brings us up to the present.
The thing we need to figure out is why.
I mean, colin, nate, hamilton house-- None of that explains taking things so far.
Well, as someone well-acquainted with the darker human emotions, Let me offer my theory.
There is only one motive powerful enough to fuel A gaslighting like this, and that is retribution.
Retribution for what? [matt and kim's "am/fm sound" playing] I know I've already said this, But I'm really proud of you, and so is mom.
Is that why she's here-- to tell me herself? Do I even wanna know where she is? She and chuck are meeting with a reporter From "the post" this morning-- some profile on bass industries.
Oh, "the post," because they have such Award-winning business coverage.
Oh, don't tell me you detect a whiff Of eau de damage control.
Mom's classic scent brings back The fondest memories of childhood.
I am way ahead of you there, But when I confronted her about it, she didn't deny it.
Bass industries is a family-run company, And like it or not, what the family does Affects what people think about it.
I know I've put her in a tough position, But please promise me that you'll try to keep her honest About where I am and what's going on.
No stories about aunt carol's in miami like when you were here.
I-I am on it, although that marlins jersey That bart bass bought me that year for christmas Would look great on you.
[laughs] Serena, eric.
Hey.
So Have you made a decision? [blair] what do you mean, no visitors? I don't think you realize who we are.
Who she thinks she is, is more like.
Look, I'm family.
I'm serena's brother-- or stepbrother, technically, Which I do mostly try to put out of my mind Seeing as we dated pretty seriously-- Humphrey, they treat people in here For less serious complexes than that.
Do you wanna get committed? I'll just call her.
I'm sure that we're on her list.
There is no list, And her phone is locked away in a drawer somewhere.
Look, serena's doctor recommended That she start her treatment with 72 hours, no contact.
That includes me, my mom, and you guys.
No, but serena doesn't need to be here.
Juliet was behind everything.
And we have some questions for her.
Whatever screwy series of events got her in the front door, She's here now, and she's getting the help She's probably needed for a long time, So whatever you're up to, you need to do it without serena.
Looks like someone's gonna have a busy holiday season.
Well, unfortunately, they're all followed up By a polite phone call asking if your father will be attending.
Oh.
Or in the case of lily's holiday party For bass industries, a handwritten note Saying she hopes I understand.
Wow, I guess I always thought the mean girls Got a little nicer once they grew up And had kids of their own.
Quite the opposite, I'm afraid.
Yeah.
But no party is more important than family.
Yeah.
About that Nate, what is it? So I really appreciate Everything you've been doing for dad, and I, you know, Wanna make sure he deserved the chance you're giving him.
So I called the business manager and asked if dad had been In contact, made any plans for when he got out.
Please tell me he didn't book a one-way flight To the caribbean.
No, but he did ask about leasing a house outside the city.
Why wasn't I told about this? He wanted to tell you.
Dad begged him not to say anything.
I already said you'd find out soon enough.
It was supposed to be a surprise.
I wish I was surprised.
So he uses our addressarole, Then uses my money to get his own place.
Same old howard.
I'm sorry, mom.
I understand if you don't wanna go through with this.
I just, you know, I really thought he had changed.
So did I.
I'll call the lawyers.
I got you into this mess, okay? I'll go to dad.
I'll tell him.
We can't do nothing for three days.
Who knows how far juliet could get in that time? Yeah, I think we just gotta tell my dad and lily What juliet did with these pills is against the law.
Police and parents--of course that's your plan, humphrey.
Or we could sneak in to see serena.
That receptionist got a pretty good look at me, But maybe with a wig That's your plan-- disguises and accents? I never said anything about accents.
Can you do any? No, look, eric is right.
We need to leave serena out of this And just find juliet on our own.
Well, colin is her cousin.
We could track him down At whatever economic summit he's at this week.
Well, nate dated her.
My minions knew her for a whole year Before we showed up.
Or There is someone Who seems to know everything about everyone.
Besides me, who? Gossip girl? She's not a ouija board, humphrey.
You can't just ask, "where's juliet?" And expect her to point you in the right direction.
Maybe you can.
Look, think about it.
You and serena are her people, not juliet.
Serena really could have been hurt, and plus I'm sure she's furious that juliet sent in that fake photo.
Does she even know that it's fake? [mt.
Desolation's "state of our affairs" playing] # morning wears a veil of rain # Hey, juliet.
It's good to see you.
It's been a while.
Yeah, thanks.
It's good to be home.
# the traffic's edging forward again # This is excruciating.
What if she doesn't respond And all we're doing is wasting valuable time? Our time is not that valuable.
Until we know where juliet is, We don't know whether we need to charter a jet Or if your metro card will suffice for our journey.
[e-mail alert chimes] That's from her.
Open it.
[click] Well, I guess we have our mission.
[clicking] Buckle up, kids.
You up for a road trip? Looks like this unholy alliance is hitting the road.
Serena, help me understand.
Are you upset because of what you did Or because you can't remember it? [sighs] both and Neither.
You know, if you saw A photo of yourself on the internet doing cocaine, What would you think? I wouldn't know what to think.
I would never do that.
Exactly.
But with me, I can't be too sure.
You know, I may not remember kissing dan and nate Or--or crossing blair, but You know, this wouldn't be the first time That I had been with two guys in one night Or betrayed my best friend.
[cork pops] Aah! [laughs] That never happened.
You're still a man in my eyes.
I always knew there was something.
Get out! [serena] things had gotten so out of control, I didn't know how to pull them back anymore.
Hey, what's happening? Are you okay? We have to go.
No, we can't leave him.
There's drugs everywhere.
We can get arrested.
[serena] so I left town alone to cornwall, connecticut, To try to start over.
[engine rumbling] [sighs] is the pedal to the metal? Because I swear if I shove my feet through the floor, I could run faster.
At least there's no radio, So I'm spared your horrid taste in music.
I think we were supposed to turn there.
You know, I'd tell you to stop being such a backseat driver, But how can you be one when you don't even know how to drive? I offered to get us a car service-- Professional driver, comfortable seats, champagne! We're on a mission here.
We need to be able to move at any moment and tail people, Speed, if necessary.
Speed?! Please.
And as for tailing someone, A stretch hummer with a hot tub Would be more inconspicuous than this.
First, my dad swapped a '69 les paul for this car.
It's a collector's item, and second, It was either this or the lincoln hawk van, Which, all I'm saying, has graphics.
Fine.
We should almost be there.
Let me just consult the g.
P.
S.
Oh, wait.
That's me.
No, but for real, cornice should be just up here.
[lily] thank you so much for your time.
Enjoy your holiday.
We really appreciate "the post's" interest in the company.
Bye.
Bye.
Ahh.
Oh, my god.
That was punishing.
I think my face actually hurts from smiling so much.
Drink? Please.
It's barely afternoon, but we've earned it.
Serena only came up once.
Yes, and I kept my promise to eric to tell the truth.
She is exhausted.
I know I am.
I think we both killed it.
You talking about how proud you are Of the work I've done at the empire.
And you're saying what A great job I've done leading the board at bass.
Well, I meant what I said.
So do I.
Mm, there was that sticky question Of when I might take back the reins of bass industries.
You kind of flinched when she asked you about it.
Well, I didn't see that it was any of her business.
It's a long ways away, and it was off topic.
I will want it back at some point.
You know that, right? Of course.
It was never my intention to be anything More than a custodian, overseeing the board Until you were ready to do it yourself.
I have to get ready for this party, And the caterers are gonna be here any moment to set up, so I'll see you tonight.
Oh.
Mwah.
It's a little early in the day for that, don't you think? Things not go well? No, actually, the interview was, um, fine.
If this is juliet's house, Then she is even freakier than we thought.
Who pretends to be poor? Wait a second.
I'm not sure what's supposed to happen Right now.
If she is really in there, what's our plan? I mean, what are we gonna do? We're just gonna March up to her And pull her hair? For starters.
[nelly] # unh, unh, unh, I was thinkin' 'bout her # # thinkin' 'bout me # [man] take it off.
Yeah! Take it off, baby! # it was only just a dream # # Oh.
At least he's owning it.
[cheering] # it was only just a dream # Juliet wouldn't be at a party like this, let alone host it.
I-I don't think this is her house.
Well, gossip girl didn't say it was, So don't just look for juliet.
Look for clues.
[boys] body shots! [indistinct conversations] Or someone who has one.
# I realize, it was only just a dream # Damien dalgaard? # I don't understand.
What changed her mind? Found out about the rhinebeck house, dad.
You couldn't even wait two weeks Before you start spending her money? That's what you think? Nate, your mom and I vacationed at that place When we were first married.
She said it was her dream house.
I saw it was for lease and I thought, Wouldn't it be great if we could get out of the city, Just the two of us? Spend some time reconnecting, Away from all our so-called friends.
I'm sorry.
I might have-- Jumped to conclusions? Pretty quickly, too.
No, you're right.
I guess this transition's gonna be harder Than we thought.
I'll talk to mom.
Don't bother.
I guess you're not the only one who assumed I was incapable Of doing something nice.
I was kidding myself.
Two of us alone in the country? Two of us together at all? It's been over for a long time.
What does that mean when you get out? I mean If you don't come home to mom, are you gonna-- A halfway house? Yes, I am.
Dad, you-- Nate, coming off of two years behind bars? A halfway house sounds pretty good to me.
If you wanna stick around, I got tv privileges, and, uh, the game is on.
Sure.
Okay.
[damien] how's your sister? She's good.
She's been living in hudson.
I banished her.
Yeah, but it's been for the best.
Listen, we're not, uh, here for a reunion.
Yeah, me neither.
I'm working.
Connecticut 'burbs Do big business over the holidays.
College kids come home.
School is always reliable.
School? Yeah.
Knightley.
I went there.
Wait.
Boarding school? Where you met serena? I didn't make the connection, but of course.
When serena ran away, She went to the knightley school in cornwall.
So do you know juliet sharp? I do.
I saw her in the city about a week ago, But whatever this is, uh, I'm not getting involved.
Well, if you sold drugs to juliet, then you already are.
It was bad.
Serena ended up in the hospital, And she says she didn't do it to herself.
Is she okay? She will be.
[lowered voice] juliet made a pretty big buy, all right? She bought coke, pills, even some ether.
I assumed she was throwing a party for those sorority girls At whatever house.
Ether? It's like a turn-of-the-century roofie.
So serena goes to boarding school with damien.
Damien sells drugs to juliet.
But what's the connection between juliet and serena? You know what? Why don't we find her address And go ask her ourselves? This is where I first met juliet.
She's a townie.
[laughs] whoo! Oh! [brakes screech, laughter] [boy] whoa! Watch where you're going, man! [laughter] [damien] what's the deal with the can opener? It's a car from britain.
It's not that weird.
I told him we should park away from the house So no one would see us getting in it.
Oh, shotgun, by the way.
[tires screech] Whoo! [engine puttering] [gossip girl] better step on it, juliet, Because your clean getaway just got very messy.
Let the sugar cube melt.
Drop it in.
[soulja boy] # soulja boy, I tell 'em # Extinguish the flame.
# hey, I got a new dance for y'all called the soulja boy # And drink up.
# three times from left to right, ahh # Ooh! [laughs] # soulja boy # Whoo! Oh, check it out.
I love this song.
# crank that soulja boy, that superman, that oh # # crank than soulja, now watch me you # # crank than soulja, now watch me you # # crank than soulja, now watch me you # Serena, wh-what do you think about a b-minus? I want an a-plus.
I know.
I just think it would seem pretty obvious If all of a sudden you started getting a's in spanish.
I thought we were going for more of a gradual improvement.
You've been studying harder And working with a-- with a tutor.
[laughs] aw, my tutor.
[giggles] # ahh, you # [knock on window] Mrs.
Sharp.
Hi.
Uh, we're juliet's friends from new york.
Is, uh, is she around? Oh.
[chuckles] um, no, no, she's out running some errands for me.
I see.
Um, I guess we'll-- we'll try again later.
Or maybe we can come in and wait? We've been dying to see her, and it was a long ride.
Um, sure.
[chuckles] sure.
Come on in.
Well, what did you say your names were? Oh, we didn't.
I'm blair.
This is dan and damien.
I'll put the kettle on.
You guys sit.
Um, so do you go to columbia with jules, or I do.
Oh.
Um, but dan goes to n.
Y.
U.
, And damien's in the school of life.
I actually know juliet from here.
I went to knightley.
Oh.
Uh, so I-I assume you know our ben.
He was a damn good teacher, no matter what they say.
I don't remember a mr.
Sharp.
No, no, his last name is donovan-- The same as my first husband.
Do you recognize him? [lowered was julies brother.
[lowered voice] well, if I taught at knightley, I wouldn't bring my "mystic pizza" townie family To school events either.
When serena went back to the city, He got fired for sleeping with a student.
Everyone was sure it was her.
Is, uh, earl grey okay? Actually, we won't be able to stay.
So you're at a new school, but it's the same old thing-- Partying, boys.
Yeah, but there was one person there who was different.
Mr.
Donovan, hey.
If you're wondering, No, I don't plan to drink both of these coffees.
One is actually for you.
It's, uh, with two creams and no sugar.
I notice that's how you take it in the dining hall.
Thank you.
Um, so if you don't mind, I was, um, wondering, I actually have some questions about arbor imagery In the poems of sylvia plath.
Well, I happen to know that will be on the final next week.
So, uh, will you sit down? [chuckles] Thank you.
Yeah, of course.
[serena] it felt good to have someone Who paid attention to me for a positive reason, And we began to spend more and more time together.
There wasn't a keg cracked within 10 miles That serena didn't know about, d then suddenly, She started staying home, reading in her room.
The generous conclusion to draw would be that serena Was getting her act together, focusing on school.
Yeah, but no one thought that.
They assumed she was sleeping With the handsome, young english teacher.
Was she? Well, I always thought the best about serena, but-- But something made you believe it was true.
I was having dinner with my aunt at the millbrook inn In poughkeepsie.
[thunder crashes] [laughing] Oh.
[laughs] [damien] as we were heading out, I saw serena Checking in with mr.
Donovan.
Uh, I-I can't believe we got a flat tire in that weather.
A trip to the mary mccarthy collection At the vassar library is so not worth it.
[laughs] Ah.
Why don't you, uh, dry off and get something to eat? And I'll go take care of that car.
What? Are you kidding? You're not going back out there.
You'll drown.
The tire's not gonna fix itself.
Yeah, but it'll stop raining by morning.
Maybe we could Get a room.
Serena Come on.
You can't act like you haven't thought about it.
The ability to have thoughts and not act on them-- It's what separates man from beast.
You're not gonna quote your way out of this.
I know what the stakes are for you.
For me, too.
But this is real on both sides, And if you deny it, you're lying.
I'm not a liar.
I'm not gonna deny anything.
I care about you very much, serena Which is why I'm going to brave the weather and fix the tire So I can drive you home So you can sleep in your own bed tonight.
[thunder crashing] You know, I think he was the only guy To ever say no to me.
I was in love with him.
Well, as in love as I had ever been at that point.
After that, I didn't know how to act around him, So We, uh, we never really talked again.
This must have been Very disappointing to the 16-year-old adventuress That you were at the time, But when you tell this story now, What does it make you think? That ben donovan was a pretty great guy.
[phone rings] Hey.
Finally.
[juliet] what do you need, ben? What's with the mood? Mom wear you out christmas shopping? No, we actually never made it to the mall.
Dan and blair showed up in cornwall with damien dalgaard.
Damien? What's he doing with them? Well, considering he's the one who sold me the pills That I used on serena, I think I have a pretty good guess.
Look, I told you the drugs were going too far.
Never mind if they go to the cops.
What if those guys show up at mom's And start asking questions? Yeah, I'm sure they already did.
And I'm sure they're figuring it all out right now, Which is exactly why I am gonna finish this thing Once and for all like I should have done in the first place.
Where are you? Are you in the city? Juliet You have done enough.
Do not go after serena.
If you touch her-- What? It's not like you can stop me.
[beep] Hey, I-I need to make another call.
Please, you've got to let me make a call.
Okay, fine, you make the call, but someone has to warn her.
Serena van der woodsen.
Hey, archibald! I'm ben.
I'm juliet's brother.
All right, you need to find serena and make sure she's okay.
Wait, wait.
What? Hey! Hey, man.
You gotta back up from the bars, man.
You can't talk to him, okay? Hey, man, what's up? [nate] hey, when's the last time you talked with serena? She's not answering her phone.
No, they took it away.
It's part of her therapy.
Oh, so she's still at the ostroff? That's good.
I guess she's safe there.
What do you mean? Safe from what? I was visiting my dad, and I ran into juliet's brother ben? He was really upset, and he, uh, seemed to think Serena's in danger.
From--from who? Juliet? I don't know.
He didn't get a chance to say.
But, uh, we should probably go check on her.
Can you go? I'm in staten island.
No, I'm [sighs] I'm with blair and damien in connecticut.
It's a long story, but All right, meet us at the van der woodsens'.
Serena should be okay where she is, But we--we need to find juliet.
Okay, I'll see you there.
[twilight sleep's "architect 10.
20 mix" playing] # [click] [gossip girl] uh-oh, s.
You've got a surprise visitor, And she's about to give you shock therapy.
Look, I think I figured it out.
Okay, serena had an affair with her teacher Because, let's face it.
It's serena, And what else is there to do in connecticut? Then she came to her senses and discarded him Like last season's chanel booties.
Then he became a crazy stalker, and serena pressharges.
That should be a warning to you, humphrey.
Yeah, because the parallels are striking.
Never-to-be-realized literary aspirations--check.
Townie--you're from brooklyn, so check.
And giving up everything to become Serena van der woodsen's stalker--check.
Face it, humphrey.
You are one knitted tie away from mr.
Donovan territory.
Yeah, except for the fact that stalker implies one-sided.
Serena went to the saints and sinners ball Because she chose me.
Yes, it was obvious this morning at the ostroff center That serena couldn't wait to be in your arms.
And for the record, I haven't given anything up To be with serena.
Oh, of course not Besides your time and your dignity.
You are chauffeuring me around, aren't you? And I'm just curious.
When was the last time you wrote anything? And scribbling "d.
Loves s.
" All over your journal every night doesn't count.
[serena] and the photo of me on "gossip girl"-- That was you, too? Yep.
I went out dressed like you And partied like it was 2007.
And then you just left me for dead in a motel room-- Why? Because of nate or colin? No, you stupid bitch, Because you destroyed my brother's life.
Who's your brother? Ben donovan.
Ben is your brother? Wh-what did I ever do to him? [scoffs] The official charge is statutory rape And transporting a minor across state lines.
But nothing happened.
The girl signed an affidavit stating otherwise.
I can't believe serena would do this.
Okay.
So I prove my innocence in court.
It's her word against mine.
I have to advise against going to trial.
They have a witness that saw you at the bed and breakfast.
You left campus with an underage student And drove across state lines.
To a library.
I know.
It's a bitter pill, but the girl's family Doesn't want the story to get out either, So they pressured the d.
A.
Into offering a plea bargain.
They can do that? Serena's from a powerful family.
And we're nobodies.
A plea bargain keeps the case out of the papers And keeps your name off the national s*x offenders list.
You can start over again.
After I serve time for a crime I didn't commit.
I'm sorry, ben.
Thanks to you, My brother's currently serving a 5-year sentence.
I swear, I never accused ben of any crime.
He was nothing but good to me.
I saw the affidavit.
I didn't sign anything.
Then who did? [man] lily! The party's lovely.
Thank you.
Now tell me, honestly, how is serena doing? Oh, she's fine.
She just needed a breather, And if it were up to me, She would be at canyon ranch right now, but they were booked.
Actually, my sister needs more than a hot stone massage To get better, but she's on her way to a full recovery.
I'm sorry, But that was what serena wanted, and you know it.
Eric, somewhere between a marlins jersey And the absolute truth lies the better part of decorum.
Becoming an adult is about learning the distinction.
[indistinct conversations] [jazz version of "here we come a-wassailing" playing] [anne] you're doing some very exciting things, I hear.
I appreciate that.
Mom, hey.
Oh, sweetheart, hi.
Well, looks like lily heard the divorce is back on.
Look, I messed up.
The house dad rented-- It was this place in rhinebeck You guys went on your first vacation.
He really did want to surprise you.
I'm afraid it doesn't change anything.
But it's not his fault, And now he's gonna have to go to a halfway house.
I'm sorry, nate.
It was never gonna work.
We were all just fooling ourselves.
[woman] hi, anne! The truth is, I need this more than I need your father.
Minnie, hi.
Hi.
How are you? Is that one of your designs? It is.
Oh! You look adorable.
Thank you.
Come.
[laughs] I need to catch up with you.
[clink] Good evening.
On behalf of bass industries, I'd like to wish you all a very happy holiday.
I'd also like to acknowledge my stepmother And all the work she's done for the company.
[applause] Serena, what is she doing here? It's okay.
I asked juliet to come.
Wait here.
I'm gonna go talk to my mom.
Okay.
[lily] when charles asked me to take over, I was overwhelmed.
Serena will explain.
But he's family, and I've tried to do what's best For my family.
It's the one thing that has always guided me.
[gasps] Serena! What a lovely surprise.
Everything okay? I need to talk to you.
Okay.
Well, let's just take a few photos real quick.
Smile.
What's going on? I don't know, but I feel a little sick inside And not just because I'm looking at him.
What, have you come to recruit another virgin To be your drug mule? I would say, "why, are you available?" But I'm leaving.
Thanks for the ride into the city.
[serena] okay, that's enough.
Thanks for helping.
[lily] just one more.
I can't do this.
Hi.
I'm--I'm serena.
I'm lily's daughter.
I wasn't gonna be able to make it tonight Because, um, I was actually at the ostroff center.
But if it were up to my mother, She'd have you believe that I was at canyon ranch.
That's because having a daughter who's in a mental hospital Threatens her carefully protected image.
She wants you all to think that she's the perfect host And mother and wife, but the truth is She's a selfish liar who will destroy anyone Who stands in her way.
Time to turn on the charm, lily, Because your perfect party just turned into the perfect storm.
I apologize.
I told serena she couldn't take The company plane to belize for christmas break, And apparently, she took it harder than I realized.
# [lowered voice] go find out What's going on with your sister.
Please, rufus, take the holiday to get things under control.
With the upcoming sale of bass industries, We don't need any more surprises.
Lily said she told you.
Of course.
Forgive me.
Um, it's been a dizzying few days.
Look, I don't know what's going on, But serena brought juliet here tonight.
[instrumental "we wish you a merry christmas" playing] Don't take one step closer to her.
How do you feel about prison food And daily strip searches? B.
, it's okay.
I talked to juliet.
She's not the problem anymore.
It's my mom.
Well, clearly, she's drugged serena again.
Dan, write a list of everything Damien said that he sold to juliet, and, you, Look at the list and tell us which one of those drugs Causes you to repeatedly trust psychopaths.
And you call the police.
Okay, nobody is calling the police.
I know everything that juliet did, And nothing excuses it, But the van der woodsens are not putting any more Of her family members behind bars.
Juliet, I'll find a way to get ben out of prison, I promise.
You're free to go now.
What? No! No, this is unacceptable.
Juliet has tried to hurt you too many times.
You can't just let her walk away.
Blair's right, serena.
I promise I won't do anything to harm serena again, Or anyone else for that matter.
[nate] yeah, that's reassuring.
I'm sorry.
I just spent a day In a Car with dan humphrey to try to track her down, And you're just letting her leave.
I really need someone to tell me what's going on.
Okay, look, I'll explain everything to everyone.
I just need to talk to my mom first.
I apologize, charles.
[sighs] It seems that my biological children Don't understand that when business is at stake, You need to leave your dirty laundry in the hamper.
Is that what ben donovan was to you--dirty laundry? Who's ben donovan? He was my boarding school teacher.
Mom falsely accused him of statutory rape, So now he's serving time for a crime he didn't commit.
Is that what the ostroff center calls treatment these days? Public scenes and false accusations? Juliet is ben's sister.
She told me everything.
So, please, no more lying.
What happened? You wanted to come home, and I wanted you here.
But when constance saw your records from knightley, They wouldn't take you back, and it was the same With all the decent schools.
And I-I was worried About your future, so I went to knightley And talked to the administration.
Of course you did.
Well, when I was on campus, There were some girls gossiping about you.
They said that you had spent the night At a bed and breakfast with one of your teachers.
That was just gossip.
Well, it was gossip I could use to our advantage.
I expressed my concern to the school That one of their teachers was having An inappropriate relationship with my underage daughter.
So you sent ben to prison so that I could go to constance? Well, no! O-of course not.
But after I left, the school Alerted the authorities, And then I didn't know what I had set in motion Until I was contacted by the d.
A.
, And by then, it was too late.
What, too late to tell the truth? So you just destroy a man's life, All so that you can keep up appearances? No, I did this for you, for your future.
Look, it's not like mr.
Donovan was guilt-free.
He--he shouldn't have been having an affair with a student.
But he didn't do anything.
Nothing ever happened.
Serena, you don't have to protect him.
I'm not protecting him.
He never touched me, mom.
You sent an innocent man to prison.
Look, everyone here has crossed the line at some point To protect someone they care about.
Sometimes There's collateral damage.
It's not so easy when you're the collateral damage.
Maybe it's time to put everything on the table.
Lily, do you have something you need to tell chuck? Well, if there was something I wanted to tell charles, I would have told him.
Lily's selling bass industries.
It's all very complicated.
I had to talk to the board first.
I trusted you with my father's company.
I want it back Immediately.
Do you really think the board would allow me to give The company to someone who just disappeared for three months? Your instability is the reason that I ended up in charge In the first place.
I won't let you do this, lily.
Serena, I'm so sorry.
Please believe me.
You have to.
I don't have to do anything for you ever again.
I I didn't wanna hurt anyone, rufus.
I really thought I was helping.
I'm sorry, lily.
I-I don't know that I believe that anymore.
They say you reap what you sow.
Better get out your gardening gloves, lily.
Looks like you're going to have a bumper crop this year.
[the rosebuds' "oh it's christmas" playing] See, I told ya, Food is more delicious when you cook it yourself.
Yep, that's why we're gonna end this experiment In middle class living and call housekeeping to clean up.
No way! I stuck my hand up a turkey's butt.
You're not getting out of your job.
Well, I provided the location, so I did my part.
Now I'm off to new zealand to enjoy a taste of summer And girls who like s*x games in the rain forest.
Well, I'll help clear.
It's only fitting, Seeing as I did the shopping, set the table, And oversaw the cooking.
All right.
[cell phone rings, beep] [nate] is that lily? By proxy.
She's in montecito so she's having cece call.
Is rufus going to join her? Yeah, but he's driving out on his own.
See? I told you road trips are strictly for humphreys.
Since my mom isn't going to help get ben out of jail, I wanna find the judge whose name is on the affidavit.
I think that he lives upstate, so I thought I'd turn it Into a road trip.
Why don't you come with me? Uh, how long were you thinking? Well, I have to be back by the time school starts.
I called dean reuther and explained that It wasn't me that dropped out.
She was not happy, But she did reinstate me.
Good-bye, friends, dan.
I'll see you in the new year.
Wait.
I'll, uh, I'll walk you out.
Here.
# New zealand? That's awfully close to australia.
You know me.
I like the heat.
Well, you'll get plenty of it if you try to make a deal With the devil.
Jack will never help you.
Maybe, but a shared enemy makes for unlikely friends.
You ready? [elevator bell dings] # oh it's christmas # Happy holidays, blair.
# [utensils clattering] Hey.
I'm sorry to just spring a road trip On you like that.
I didn't even ask what your plans for the break were.
Oh, no, I don't really have any plans.
I was Sort of hoping to hang out with you And Go see some movies, maybe get some writing done.
Well, then why don't you come with me? You could still write.
Come on.
It would be so much fun.
It would be just the two of us listening to the radio And eating roadside food and do a little recon along the way.
What do you say? I think it would be good for us.
But would it be good for you? Serena, I would love to go away with you, But it feels like this trip Is something you might need to do on your own.
I've been trying so hard to prove to the world That I've changed.
But I think the person that doubted the most was me.
I'm gonna work on that.
And you'll succeed.
I know you will.
I mean, I know you better than anyone.
[kisses] Be safe.
[diddy-dirty money] # tell the world I'm coming home # # let the rain wash away # Whenever we give up something we really care about, We hope that the universe Will reward our selfless choice.
Ho, ho, ho! Hey, dad, how's it going? I've done some research On my options for halfway houses, And some of them aren't too bad.
I mean, after prison, It's not like I need the four seasons.
What about the empire? What do you mean? Well, I spoke with the parole board.
I gave them my address as where you'll be reporting in January.
I want you to come back to a home.
Thank you, nate.
I can't tell you how much this means to me.
Well, I'm out buying you some new clothes.
I know you've been locked away for a while, But no one's wearing orange this season.
[laughs] However, it's not always fate that gives us a gift.
Sometimes it's someone closer to home.
What are you still doing here? Shouldn't you be off living your dream-- Days on end in a real car with serena? No, I'm staying here, so actually, I'll be living out my nightmare, Trapped in the city with only blair waldorf to talk to.
Nate's here.
I'll share custody as long as I'm in first position.
No, nate's with his grandfather.
Eric, then.
Gstaad with elliot.
Please don't continue down the list.
I promise you, it's just me.
I won't be calling.
I'm gonna be very busy writing, Turning vanessa's room into an office, Seeing "nnette" at the film forum.
I'm seeing "nnette" at film forum.
You like french documentaries about orangutans? "nnette" is an inspiration.
Last summer, I'd go to the jardin des plantes All the time just to visit her.
If we happen to run into each other, Please don't sit next to me.
I wouldn't think of it.
Let's just finish these dishes so we can go home, all right? I'll wash.
You dry.
You wouldn't know how to handle riedel.
This coming from the one holding what appears to be A bottle of l'occitane shampoo.
You can't wash good wineglasses in common dish soap.
Just follow my lead, humphrey.
You're used to doing that.
# coming home, tell the world that I'm coming home # Excuse me.
Could you please just tell me what's going on? My mom and sister are out of town, So I know they aren't visiting.
# thank you lord, I'm coming home # # I'm coming home # Serena.
What are you doing here? I had to come see you.
# all the pain of yesterday # I don't know what to say.
Neither do I.
But I feel like I should start.
If you love someone, set them free.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, gossip girl.
I never accused ben of any crime.
I saw the affidavit.
I didn't sign anything.
Then who did? Lily's selling bass industries.
I won't let you do this, lily.
since my mom isn't gonna help get ben out of jail, I wanna find the judge whose name is on the affidavit.
Why don't you come with me? Serena, I would love to go away with you, But it feels like this trip Is something you might need to do on your own.
I- I promise you I'm gonna be very busy writing, Seeing "nnette" at the film forum.
I'm seeing "nnette" at film forum.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

, gossip girl.
It's a cold new year, upper east siders.
Time to donate that fall wardrobe to the help And to present the world with a better version of you Which could mean facing your future je te plumerai le tte  And forgetting past mistakes bang, you're dead, alouette  paint your silhouette  je te plumerai le tte  Or finally settling on a brave new path.
But a new year doesn't wipe away old problems.
Well, welcome back.
All this for two weeks? I had no idea where my p.
I.
Mission was gonna take me.
I had to be prepared.
For a night with taylor swift? Aside from forging affidavits that send innocent men to jail, Judge stephens also enjoys riding horses On his ranch in virginia.
Well, someone did her research.
Apparently, not enough, because he wasn't there, And no one knew where he was, So I had to pull an erin brockovich and go down To the litchfield county clerk's office To try to get a copy of the case.
And how's this for irony? Court records are public, So you wore a push-up bra for no reason? No, the file was sealed because the case involved a minor.
just take me away from my problems.
Please, tell me, what did you do over the break? Why? What did you hear? I Ate leftovers And supervised dorota taking down the tree, And I finally settled On who I want to intern for this semester.
Indra nooyi- "forbes'" number six most powerful woman in the world.
Wow.
I'm impressed.
As she will be once I figure out how to win her over Before the internship deadline, which, yes, is in three days.
Did you Happen to see dan over the break? Why would I? What's going on with you two anyway? I don't know.
I guess we'll find out how we both feel at family brunch.
Well, here's my advice.
Have a little faith.
And if that doesn't work, a lot of mimosas.
un, deux, trois  bang, bang, bang  alouette  when feathers fly, you deny everything  Hey, man.
How was new zealand? I have to say, it was an extraordinary bust.
Jack was out of the country.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Man.
I knew you were counting on his help.
As fate would have it, I might've found one last ally.
My father's old friend russell thorpe Is in town from chicago.
He's hosting a party at apella this afternoon.
I'm on my way to his field office To see if I can get a meeting.
oh, yeah! give it! I hear you've kept yourself entertained in my absence.
No, that's not me.
That's right.
Your father's out on parole.
How's it been? 40-15.
I know he's earned the right to blow off a little steam, But it's been nothing but spas and restaurants and nightclubs.
I mean, shouldn't he be concentrating on-on his future? Perhaps you should dock his allowance.
Oh, yeah! Hey, nate, need one more for a foursome.
You in, dude? That's not what it sounded like.
But I should go.
Good luck.
You, too.
Boom goes the dynamite! People still use mailboxes? Oh.
No, it's vanessa's mail.
She's moving back into the dorms.
Welcome home.
So How was your break? What did you do? Why? What'd you hear? Nothing, which I'm afraid Is what I have to report from my road trip.
Mm.
I'm sorry.
I know you were hoping for some closure.
Well, my mom's deviousness is the gift that keeps on giving.
So, for now at least, the past still lingers.
Uh, was brunch a special occasion? No, no, no.
I have an interview with writers house later.
It's a literary agency for my internship.
Well, that's the one good thing about being a freshman.
I don't have to think about that this year.
Mm, that and-and a lot of other things, it seems.
Dan, you knew my focus was fixing things for ben.
I didn't realize I had an ultimatum.
you know, let's go inside.
It's cold out.
Hey, I, uh, I wanted to call, but she wouldn't let me.
are you telling me it's been a week, And you still can't get me five minutes alone with indra? She's only here for two days Before heading to chennai tomorrow.
Her schedule's packed.
Oh, I've always wanted to go to india.
Can you get me a seat on her plane? Or get me her itinerary.
It's being faxed over.
go, go, go, go.
Make a decision, laurel, Or I'll make the last one you'll hear.
Got it.
What are you girls doing? Just solidifying the details of my internship.
Oh, honey, that reminds me.
I was thinking, why not work with me at waldorf designs? You love fashion.
Well, I also love a good pot au feu, But that doesn't mean that I'm gonna build a career around it.
Well, I have a-a monster of a day.
Ohh! Do you know how many women would kill to work with your mother? Yes, And they're the jenny humphreys of the world.
Indra's itinerary.
Ugh.
This isn't hers, it's my mother's.
And indra's on it.
My mother's dressing her for a party this afternoon.
Dorota! Well, mr.
Thorpe can't meet at noon, So you can push or you can cancel, Whichever you prefer.
Thought so.
If I could impose on you to pop back up to the office And tell mr.
Thorpe chuck bass is here to see him.
I'll take a coffee and today's "pravda" If it'll be a few minutes.
I'm sorry.
Who are you? Chuck bass.
I just flew in from new zealand, Got the invitation to mr.
Thorpe's party.
Thought I'd stop by early to discuss business.
Would you mind telling me what this is regarding? I don't usually expose my private matters To assistants.
"assistant"? I prefer the term "secretary," don't you? Why not just call things as you see them? Couldn't agree more.
So since I'm sure your boss will see me, If you just tell him I'm here- That won't be possible.
Let me save your job, sweetheart, And tell you why it is possible.
I'm trying to block the potential sale Of bass industries, my dead father's legacy.
And since mr.
Thorpe and my father were business associates When they were starting out, I'm sure he'd like The opportunity to help me intervene.
I meant, that won't be possible Because mr.
Thorpe hasn't touched down from chicago yet.
And I probably shouldn't tell you this, But I'm listening.
In my position here, I'm privy to certain information, And it appears you may be out of the loop.
The potential sale of bass industries is very real.
There's a deal on the table, And it's fast-tracked to close in 24 hours.
I'm guessing I'll be seeing you at my boss' party later? I'm sorry for ambushing you guys, But we need to start talking again All of us.
Dan, how's that internship search going? Oh, that's right.
Maybe I can help.
I can call one of my friends at cond nast.
Hmm.
Maybe you could, uh, Forge your signature on the cover letter? serena.
This talking thing's going great.
What I wanna know is how many times You got your hair done this week While an innocent man sat in prison.
Serena.
Contrary to what you might believe, I'm handling this in a way that is best for this family, And we're not gonna discuss it anymore.
Okay.
I'm gonna make sure she's okay.
And I'm not hungry anymore, so I'll see you at home.
Hmm.
She'll come around.
Just give her time.
Thank you for trusting me.
Mm.
I'm, uh, I'm gonna go get our check and coats.
Oh, judge stephens.
Hi.
Um, I hope you enjoyed your time in the city, Um, but you can return to the ranch now.
I'll take it from here.
Crazy question, But why isn't ben just going after lily himself? Because he knows she'll go to the cops And tell them what juliet did to me.
Oh, you mean kidnap and drug you? Look, however wrong it was, Enough harm has been done to their family by ours.
It's a lot to take on by yourself, that's all.
You know, I am tired, And this crusade has taken me away from other things.
Well, you wanna go somewhere and talk? Or not talk? Serena, a moment.
Uh, now is not a good time.
Unfortunately, time is why I'm here.
Unless we stop her, your mother is going to sell bass industries In 24 hours.
I think I have a plan that can get us both what we want.
Well, we've waited this long.
What's a few more hours? Sure.
My interview's at 2:30, so Okay, we'll meet at the waldorf's at 2:00 And then cab down there together.
Watch your back, lily.
These kids are definitely not all right.
As I see it, we have two distinct goals.
I want to block the sale of bass industries, You want to get old ben out of jail.
Yet, a single strategy may satisfy us both.
Which is? Blackmail.
But I can't pressure her unless I have hard evidence.
Oh, while you were brunching, I took the liberty of checking the safe at the house.
Did you know she has a safety deposit box At the dorset bank on madison? No.
I know you've spent your entire life Not wanting to become your mother, but desperate times You gettin' soft, kid? No, I'm getting bursitis.
That was mile nine.
Maybe we should head back.
I feel like I'm 20 again.
I am 20.
I think I'm gonna puke up a lung.
Don't you have things to do? Like what? Something on your mind? Just making sure You're concentrating on the future, is all.
Your terms of parole are pretty specific-a job, for one.
I know what the terms are, Which was why my p.
O.
Already has An interview set up for me this afternoon.
Really? Why didn't you tell me? That's fantastic.
Well, I thought it'd be a nice surprise.
How about this? After I gethis job, What do you say I take you out to celebrate? I told chuck I'm going to this thorpe party later.
Russell thorpe? Yeah.
But you know what? A celebratory dinner sounds like a good after-party.
Maybe you could get an advance and pick up the check.
At the pay grade I'm at, I hope you don't mind the halal cart.
Uh, you look beat.
Listen, uh I'll see you later, all right? Yeah.
Sure.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I was wondering Elevator's coming up.
Okay.
Thank god.
Showtime.
What are you doing here? Hello to you, too.
I told you that it was just one movie on one lonely holiday break.
That's it.
No, I'm here to see serena.
Oh.
Well, she's not here to see you.
shocker.
Where is she? Uh, she's off scheming with chuck.
Disguises are involved.
It can't end well.
I'll wait.
I'm sure she'll be back.
She knows I have an interview to get to.
You do know that "powerful woman" Is not actually a career, right? And neither is serena van der woodsen, But 10 bucks says that You'll miss your interview waiting for her Yet again.
scheme you're cooking up Blows up in your face, as per usual.
loitering lounge is upstairs.
Already there, sister.
no, laurel.
Go! The schedule was not sent over.
Look, I can't have the office falling apart now.
I am in over my head with fittings.
What? I'm sorry about what I said earlier.
It was the stress talking.
I thought about it, And I really would love to intern with you.
Really? Well That is just great, dear.
And since you seem to have your hands full, I thought maybe I could accompany you Oh.
On your fittings for the midwestern mogul party.
Well-well-well, perhaps, uh, it might be more efficient, Uh, for you to have your own assignment Rather than accompanying me.
Even better.
Why not- Patti blagojevich! I'm going to assume that that noise was a sneeze And that you meant to say indra nooyi.
indra? Don't be silly.
She is a huge new client, and you are just an intern.
But You can deliver this to patti And you can style her.
god knows she needs it.
But- darling, I am thrilled.
Tell indra's people That her eleanor waldorf fitting has been moved up a half-hour.
Relax.
You're a spitting image.
Remind me to kill you later for that.
The teller we need to talk to is named julie.
She's new.
I'd remember her.
And who do we say you are? My son? Is it weird hearing you say that actually turns me on? This better be worth the therapy.
Let's get this over with.
Yeah, hi, this is dan humphrey.
I am caught in some brutal traffic.
Can I reschedule? No, I didn't realize he was deciding today or I I wouldn't have put myself in this position.
okay.
Thank you.
Will lonely boy ever learn that s.
Can't tell time, Especially when she's wasting someone else's? mostly I don't seem  All I have in my pile are divorce papers, jewelry, And artful nudes of my mother in her groupie days.
Swap piles? I knew there would be nothing.
What did you expect to find in here, anyway? A gun.
The smoking kind.
I snap back  Oh, my god.
You found a copy of the affidavit.
Any handwriting expert would be able to prove That this is not mine.
Not that we'll ever need to call one.
The threat alone is enough.
Looks like serena may have found Ben's get-out-of-jail-free card.
We have her.
You wanna make the call or should I? No.
Later, in person.
I like the way you think, mom.
Charles.
I assume you weren't upstairs playing rufus' guitars.
If you didn't want me rooting around in the family safe, You should've changed the combination.
Well, I'm just curious- what were you hoping to find? A way to stop you from disposing Of the last remaining bit of my father.
Is that what you think I'm doing? Why else would you be selling bass industries? Because it's in trouble, charles.
What are you talking about? You read the papers.
Real estate, hotels Even in manhattan, no one's impervious.
Why wouldn't you tell me? Because I thought we could ride it out, Refinance or something.
I was hoping I could turn it around And wouldn't have to tell you, but then you disappeared.
And by the time you got back, it was an inevitability.
You expect me just to accept this, go on with my day? If I sell now, I can control how we sell it and to whom.
There's a private buyer that's made a very generous offer.
The company will stay intact, and so will your father's name.
And the money from the sale Will give you a chance to build a future.
And who knows? Maybe even buy it back someday.
But if this deal gets messed up- Bass industries will go to the highest bidder- Someone who'll fire the employees, Cheapen the brand.
Exactly.
This buyer's committed to maintaining The company's integrity, your father's integrity.
And I know he'd want you to be a part of the next phase.
Is it russell thorpe? You don't have to say.
I know it's him.
The important thing is that you believe me When I tell you I don't want your father's legacy to die.
I'm trying to save what's left of it.
In 24 hours, you'll see, And hopefully serena will see some things, too.
Yes, penelope, You will stand in the cold and hail me a cab.
Call me when it's curbside.
And show some leg if you have to.
I'm already late for indra.
Is dan still here? No.
He left 20 minutes ago.
Where were you? Oh, I feel terrible about standing him up, But we found a copy of the affidavit.
B.
, I think I can get ben out of prison.
What? You didn't know him.
He was a good man before all this happened.
They're all good men before something happens to them, s.
Some of them stay good, no matter how they're treated.
I thought you hated dan.
I do, so very much.
But whatever it is that you see in him, He seems to see in you as well.
I know you wanna focus on ben, But maybe you're avoiding your future, not fixing your past.
Hey, I thought we were gonna meet up later.
We'll have to hit "pause" on that.
I think lily is trying to do the right thing By the company and by your inmate, too.
She said she'll prove it in 24 hours.
Of course she did.
Well, there's something I have to do anyway, so One more day.
Who is this russell thorpe exactly? His name sounds familiar.
Oh.
Um He and bart started out in real estate About the same time.
He ended up settling in chicago.
Comes into town once a year, throws a garish party So we all know he still exists.
I wish we didn't have to go, but But nothing.
According to this invitation, it's gonna be a wingding.
why aren't you dressed? Uh, shirt, pants Yeah, I'm dressed.
Look, I know you disapprove of me, But can't you please do so in a tuxedo? The sale of bass industries is in a very delicate stage, And it's vital that we at least present a unified family front.
Fine.
Then it's just us.
Hello? may I speak to mrs.
Humphrey, please? This is the concierge at the palace.
Uh, yeah, she just left.
Can I take a message? It seems that The guest mrs.
Humphrey was hosting, john stephens, Left a pair of cufflinks in his room When he checked out this morning.
Um, I'm sorry, you mean Judge john stephens? Dorota, have you seen the dress marked for indra nooyi? And-and what is patti blagojevich's dress Still doing here? Uh-oh.
Where is blair? No one is answering in her room, miss.
Thus the reason I need your services.
Now let's see that master key card of yours.
It's against hotel policy to open- Listen Harvey? Ms.
Nooyi was expecting me.
So the silence on the other side of the door Could only mean one of two things.
Either she neglected her appointment, Which a woman of her professionalism Is not wont to do, or she's lying there, Having choked on one of her own snack chips, While you're standing here quibbling about policy.
As I thought.
Spotted-b.
Using old tricks To get to one nooyi.
Ms.
Nooyi? Indra? Assistants? Anyone? But it seems That someone got an s.
O.
S.
To the c.
E.
O.
Sorry, b.
That internship has sailed.
Hey.
Nice tie.
You changed it.
Mm.
I'm-I'm really sorry.
I- I swear I thought I would make it in time.
Did you miss your interview? Yeah, but it was my own fault For thinking you'd show up on time.
Look, I-I-I really can't get into this now.
I'm on my way out.
Where you going? Well, james franco's giving a reading Of some of his short stories at housing works, And the writers house agent is gonna be there.
So I'm gonna go and try to- try to woo him.
The agent, not james franco.
Well, why don't I go with you as your date? And then after you impress the hell out of the agent, We can have that talk.
Well, you did come all the way to brooklyn to apologize, And you aren't dressed for a party, so Hold on.
Hey, eric.
What's up? You know that judge stephens you were looking for? Mom was hiding him at the palace while you were gone.
And guess when he checked out.
This morning, after brunch? Hey, shall we? Um, let me call you back.
Yeah, I just need to make a quick detour first.
Looks like serena's ablaze on a path to punishment.
Suit up, lily.
Your baby's out for blood.
Why don't you get us some drinks? I'll be just a minute.
All right.
Hey.
What are you doing here? I thought you went to brooklyn.
I did.
Dan came with me.
Have you seen chuck? No.
Have you seen indra nooyi? No.
Oh, but I do see your mother, And she doesn't seem too happy to see you.
Gotta go.
Bye.
Hey.
What are you doing here? With your family? Serena.
You? I got a call this afternoon, so I'm looking for my dad, Who skipped a job interview he was required to go to By his parole officer.
Oh, and what did he skip it to do? Eat a chicago superdawg?  Mr.
Bass.
Looking dapper.
Thank you Raina.
Someone wanted to say hello.
mr.
Thorpe.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, sir.
Call me russell.
I see you met my daughter.
Raina thorpe.
Mm-hmm.
Wharton grad, Thorpe enterprises' vice president, And most trusted advisor to her proud and aging papa.
You said you were his assistant.
You said that.
I said I prefer the term "secretary," Which I do, for those whom it actually refers to.
Raina never lies.
It's her best quality.
I highly doubt that.
Actually I know it's premature, russell, but, uh, I came here To shake the hand of the man who's buying bass industries.
What's that? I understand your need for discretion.
And while I wasn't happy the company was being sold, I was heartened to learn That it would be my father's old friend at the helm.
Son, uh, I'm not the buyer.
And I was good friends with your father Until he kicked me out of every deal he could And pushed me out of new york.
If I'd known in time that his company was going up for sale, I would've bought it cheap, dismantled it for parts, And hosted a fire sale.
Dan? This party doesn't seem like your speed.
Are you kidding? There are actually beers behind the bar I can pronounce.
No, I, uh, I'm here with serena.
Oh, she didn't tell me she was coming.
No, she wasn't, but eric called her, and Here we are.
Hi, mom.
I, uh- so sorry I'm late, But I couldn't find my cufflinks, So I just- I borrowed the ones That judge stephens left at the palace.
Uh, what's going on? Dan, when you see serena, please tell her to stop whatever It is she's planning on doing before she destroys our family.
I can't believe your nerve.
What were you planning to do, Lobby ms.
Nooyi for a job in the changing room? No, I was going to wait until after.
Meetings in underwear tend not to be taken seriously.
You would use me and jeopardize my business To pursue a career you thought of five minutes ago Based on some power list? I'm sorry I lied to you, But your dress was going to look stunning on her No matter who zipped it up in the back.
I have to take my future into my own hands.
Otherwise Otherwise what? You'll be forced to follow in my footsteps? no, that's- that's fine, dear.
Now that I realize that your childish games Are actually who you are and not a phase, I wouldn't want someone like you Wanting to be like me.
And you are fired.
There are you.
What's wrong? Let's just say my patience is as strained As your mother's credibility.
Ugh.
What did she do? She misled me.
The question is, why? You know why-to serve her own best interests, always.
I found out that she paid off the judge twice- Once years ago to notarize my signature And again recently to disappear So that I couldn't hold him accountable.
You have the affidavit? Let's go find my mom.
Wait, I've got a better idea.
We need to fire a warning shot.
That guy is a journalist for the "post.
" Give it to him, Tell him to ask questions.
Start with your mother.
That way she'll know we're serious.
Hey, what are we doing here? Just one more minute.
No, no more minutes.
I'll head off lily.
Look, she can't keep getting away with this.
It's-it's not fair.
Fair? My agent meeting was important today.
It was my last shot.
I know, but you'll get another chance.
Mm, no, I won't.
Normal people don't get an endless number of chances No matter the situation.
That's just you.
Whatever it is you're planning to do, Is it worth it? Or are you gonna walk out the door with me right now?  I'm sorry.
It seems like love can't compete With the allure of war.
Find your seats, honored guests.
Justice is served.
Serena, what's in the envelope You just gave the "post" reporter? That is a copy of the affidavit.
So you can have judge stephens release ben And cancel the sale of bass industries.
If not, I'll tell the reporter the truth, And the "post" will have a cover story.
Excuse me, this what I think it is? There's an explanation.
No need.
I get it.
I know how bad the job market is these days.
What? Can you please this dan humphrey that while I'm very flattered, I don't have the power to hire anyone.
Print's a dying medium.
He switched the envelopes.
Hmm.
That's my boy.
I need a drink.
My son was actually looking for an internship, not a job.
What in the hell were you trying to do? Get ben out of prison, mom.
What, by putting me in? I wasn't gonna press charges against you.
Well, it wouldn't be your choice.
It would be the district attorney's.
The information about ben and the affidavit Can never get out, ever.
Now can you just trust me when I say I'm handling it? hey, I still have some friends in this town, And some of them are at this party.
Why are you so upset? Because you skipped your job interview today, dad.
Lucky for you, I covered.
I told your p.
O.
You twisted your ankle on our jog.
Got him to reschedule it for tomorrow.
Nate, I went to the damn interview, okay? I walked into that waiting room in my suit and tie, And I realized I was there to beg for a janitor's job Along with half a dozen other ex-cons Who probably don't have a high school education.
Do you know how that makes me feel? Not good, I'm guessing.
I mean here to reignite some old business connections, To remind people that before everything that went down, I used to be good at what I did.
 I'm gonna make you proud of me, I promise.
That's what you said right before you got caught.
Here are your coats.
oh, thank you very much.
I thought I saw you storm out of here ten minutes ago.
Well, on top of everything else, they can't find my coat.
So it doesn't take a genius to figure out That your sorry scheme blew up in your face.
You owe me $10.
And serena disappointed you twice today, so you owe me $20.
Coat checker! What's wrong? It's not the coat.
I'm sorry.
Are we friends? Of course not.
Here you go, sir.
Oh, excellent.
Thank you.
Here you are.
I had a horrible fight with my mother.
I tried to be indra nooyi, And while I admit that choice may have been a bit random, The other choice was to be my mother, and I didn't want that.
Why not? You care about fashion More than most people care about, uh Well, anything.
You used to send girls home crying from constance For wearing tights as pants.
Well, somebody had to.
It was for the greater good, Just like my suggestion that you take off that tie And shove it in your pocket right now.
You're an evil dictator of taste, blair.
Why deny that just because it's what your mother does? And by the way, this tie was my grandfather's.
If only he'd been buried in it.
I didn't lie to you, charles.
Are you familiar with the sin of omission? You seemed calmed by the idea of thorpe as the buyer, And I needed to keep things smooth for another 24 hours So that this deal would close without incident, But it looks like I failed.
the buyer just called.
Somehow, he heard about the scene that just transpired, The little war between me and my children, And he's backing out.
Over a family squabble? All he had to do was hear that you and I were in a standoff.
And now he's concerned that there would be problems Between us every step of the acquisition.
So My father's life's work Is heading for the auction block? pray it goes to someone who doesn't chop it up.
shh, shh.
Thank you, all, for coming, and, uh, a special thanks To the folks who came in from chicago, Uh, where we've enjoyed a great run.
But a wise man once told me, "if you stay in one place long enough, You'll never go anywhere.
" Which is why my daughter and I Are very pleased to announce That thorpe enterprises is packing up and moving east To new york city.
I was planning to get settled before I dove into business, But I'm a restless man.
So I've decided to set my sights high on a company That has just this minute come back up on the block- My dear departed friend's bass industries.
Looks like "page six" of this party will read, "the world according to thorpe.
" So Cheers to new friends And inevitable enemies.
Forget your usual suspects, upper east siders.
I look forward to facing you all.
cheers.
There's a new family in town.
Come to twist the knife further? You were right.
I used you And I shouldn't have.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
I- I've watched you struggling to find your path, And I guess I just hoped that you would want to follow mine.
But like any self-respecting daughter With an egocentric mother Would be repelled by the thought of being anything like her.
That is not true.
Uh, mother, you are brilliant And resilient.
And A businesswoman And an artist.
I'd be crazy not to want to be like you.
Really? But you are not a designer.
You are a, um A dictator of taste.
Exactly.
I love that.
Who said that? A friend of mine.
Well, if only there was a person who did that for a living, Someone for you to aspire to.
There is.
Editrix of a high fashion magazine.
So we'll strategize in the morning? once there was a friend of mine who  I realized I didn't really need to be in possession of this.
he lost his way  Thank you, I guess.
he loved  I would say I'm sorry about today, But in my head, that just sounds inadequate.
Nah, you don't need to apologize.
It's not your fault that I seem to drop everything Just to make myself available to you.
I don't mean to take you for granted.
It's just, if we're being completely honest We are.
I think that maybe sometimes I test you.
You know, I keep thinking that if things get too hard, You'll give up on me, but you never do.
And I never will.
If you really need me ever, I am there, But I think there's a reason you didn't insist I come with you over break.
And why you didn't try to make me stay? So where does that leave us? With one last shot.
If we ever do jump in again, that'll be it.
We either sink or swim.
We won't get another chance.
And when that time comes, We better make damn sure we're ready.
Yeah.
We should.
and then you'll see her again  Nate, I can't talk right now.
Yes, you can.
Your parole officer just called me 'cause he didn't know where you were again.
Dad, if you don't get a job soon, They're gonna send you back to prison.
Kid, I'm at an interview right now.
Yeah, at this time of night? Sure, dad.
Whatever you say.
sorry about that.
Just my son.
Anyway, you were saying? Well, I've been gone for a while, and, uh, We've been hard-pressed to find just the right financial guy To introduce us to n.
Y.
C.
I know you've still got a lot of friends, family connections.
What do you think? In the new year, We resolve to do things we've only dreamed of doing And not to do other things ever again.
I hope your visits don't become a habit, humphrey.
Don't worry.
I don't think You'll be seeing me around here for a while.
Heading home to brooklyn? No.
actually, I was gonna catch "monsieur hulot's holiday" at the walter reade.
Try to cheer myself up.
Oh.
Well, I do enjoy myself some tati.
Though I suppose if you're trying to improve your mood That my coming with you would defeat that purpose.
It is pretty funny.
Even you couldn't kill that much comedy.
I still require you to sit two seats away.
works for me.
Keeps your paws off my popcorn.
Wait here while I change.
We may surprise ourselves as we face the future Or be surprised when cleaning up the past.
gets crazy life  where every breath  Hi.
I'm here to see ben donovan.
I know it's late, but I really need to talk to him.
I'm sorry.
You just missed him.
Mr.
Donovan was released.
What? How? His parole was moved up by a judge stephens.
When did this happen? Says here the paperwork was filed a couple days ago, Just went through this evening.
call me  So russell thorpe seems nice.
Oh, my god.
It's not just his disloyalty or deviousness.
It's his pomposity.
And the fact that you slept with him? How did you kn- I remembered where I knew the name.
It's from the time when we exchanged our lists.
Oh, well, it was a long time ago, and it was fleeting.
I'll break your heart  Just when you thought You'd escaped another major scandal today Dishonesty may help some make a few good amends all dangers start  While others are left to wonder if they can handle the truth.
What are you doing here? Riverpark's one of the only bars I like in new york.
And I came to offer you an apology.
Today at the office, the identity game- I'm usually more straightforward than that, Which leads me to my next point.
Edge of my seat.
My father reported Your family's fight to the buyer during the party.
Scared him off so he could go after it himself.
While I'm impressed with your honesty, I can't say I like the information Or your relationship to it.
It's just business.
Right now I'm trying to focus on whatever pleasure I can.
If you can separate the two, so can I.
My car is just outside.
I'll wait five minutes before taking off.
If I go home alone, I'll never bring it up again.
hold on right now  we won't let you fall  we are waiting  for you  with your dying need for  And whether you kick things off by sleeping with the enemy Or trying your best to remake a former friend Serena.
You're still here.
Just waiting for the bus.
What are you even doing here? Are you free for coffee? I'm free for anything.
One thing's for sure- Anything is possible.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, gossip girl.
Bass Industries.
My car is just outside.
I'll wait five minutes before taking off.
What in the hell were you trying to do? Get Ben out of prison.
What, by putting me in? The information about Ben in the affidavit can never get out, ever.
I'm here to see Ben Donovan.
I'm sorry.
You just missed him.
Mr.
Donovan was released.
Are you free for coffee? I'm free for anything.
Have you come to recruit another virgin to be your drug mule? I would say, why, are you available? And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

, Gossip Girl.
Brr, Upper East siders.
It's cold outside.
And as February approaches, we need to find ways to fight frostbite.
Some keep warm the old-fashioned way.
Who knew what a turn-on it would be to sleep with a woman trying to buy my company? As long as we play clean in business, I'm happy to keep it dirty between the sheets.
Some seek the comfort of loved ones.
And some try to keep away the gloom What are you doing up this early? By painting things bright.
Breakfast with Ben.
And don't lecture.
He's a nice person a nice, innocent person who deserves a friend after what my mom did to him.
A lot of mascara for a friend, but you can have breakfast with whomever you want.
I don't judge.
Well, today I don't, because today everything is new and fresh and golden.
Today my internship begins.
You're finally going to tell me where it is? It's too important.
I can't jinx it.
I'll tell you after my first day, but I must go.
But you realize most offices aren't even open this early unless you're interning at a doughnut shop? I want to be early.
What is wrong with being early? Catch the worm! Okay, I'll see you at the "W" party tonight.
And good luck at your new job at the mayor's office or the Whitney or CIA or whatever.
This this is like living with Don Draper.
Lily, again, thank you so much for getting me this opportunity.
Just so you know, it may not be what don't worry.
I realize most internships are about exploitation and espresso runs.
I'm just happy to get a chance to be around writing again.
Well, then you're welcome, Daniel.
How about a celebratory breakfast? Uh, you know, I-I can't.
I'm super busy.
I gotta I gotta limber up for all this bootlicking I'm gonna be doing, but thank you.
Okay.
Bye.
Well, at least one of our kids appreciates me.
Lily.
I get Ben out on parole, but Serena and Eric continue to treat me like I'm toxic.
I know you did what you could, but Ben's still gonna have a criminal record.
Give them time.
Everything I do or have ever done is for my children.
And someday they'll realize that.
Right? Hmm.
Hmm.
No, please, let me.
I asked.
You got last time.
I'm sorry I had to leave so abruptly.
My, uh, friend Edward was waiting for me.
How's life on his sofa? Pullout couch beats a prison cot.
Serena The reason I asked you here is 'cause I heard from an old college friend.
He's starting an organic farm in Ithaca, wants me to move up there.
Wow.
Ithaca it's supposed to be beautiful.
But are you sure? Being outside all day, working with my hands after being cooped up for so long, it's kind of ideal.
Yeah.
Well, I hope we get to spend some time together before you go.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I wanna start my new life as soon as possible.
I hope you understand.
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
I'm sure we can, you know, write or e-mail or call or I'm really happy for you.
Take care, Serena.
Rufus, hey, you used to have a plot in a community garden, right? You gotta be kidding me.
"Scorpio Rising" was a great film.
That dreck puts the "ick" in "esoteric.
" All right, fine.
We can go see The Merchant Ivory Retrospective.
You can ensure that your delicate sensibilities aren't disturbed, and I can catch up on my sleep.
Going to movies is a one or 4-time thing.
It's not like we're friends.
I never suggested we were, but I am going to see The Joseph Beuys exhibit in Chelsea.
Oh, you are such a boy.
How could you go to that when the Degas is about to close at the Morgan? You are such a girl.
I'm gonna take a pass on the ballerinas.
Frilly dresses and tutus are not my idea of art.
Fashion is the most powerful art there is.
It's movement, design, and architecture all in one.
It shows the world who we are and who we'd like to be, just like your scarf suggests that you'd like to sell used cars.
Vanessa gave me this scarf.
Look, I-I have to go.
Stop wasting my time.
You know today is a big day for me.
So you're gonna finally tell me what internship you got? No, all right.
Well, then I won't say which one I got either.
I will see you Sunday at the Morgan.
I will wear my most fashionable toe shoes.
Don't get your hopes up.
Serena.
Hey, it's great to see you.
I heard about the Ostroff Center, and Juliet giving you the the drugs that you sold her? I had no idea what her plans were.
I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Look, I couldn't care less about clearing your conscience.
When are you gonna realize your occupation hurts people? I don't give anyone anything that they don't come looking for.
Okay, well, then I guess you're only half responsible that I almost died.
"W" stands for "way better" than I even imagined.
I'm already planning outfits in my head.
If you mean outfits for Lara stone to wear in our Meisel shoot on Friday, I would love to hear your thoughts, but if you're dreaming about what you're gonna wear to the party tonight, think again.
I saw that movie, too, but this is real life, not some Hollywood chick flick where a girl with a scrunchie gets a makeover and triumphs in the end.
I have never owned a scrunchie.
I think I read that on your rsum.
Down there is the main production area, conference room, and through those doors editor in chief, Stefano Tonchi.
And how soon can I get a sit-down with him? I have some exciting new ideas that I've organized in a Powerpoint presentation.
I've been Stefano's assistant since he took over.
I've barely had five minutes alone with him.
But my research says he has an open door policy, that he's collaborative.
Doesn't mean he isn't crazy busy.
Then it sounds like he needs my help immediately.
Ah, you're all so young, so adorable.
All who? All of you interns.
But I Thought it was just me.
Thousands of applications.
These are the best of the best.
I'm the best of the best.
I'm Blair Waldorf.
Assuming that's your way of saying you're the most distinguished, ambitious student at your school, then they're all Blair Waldorfs from Princeton, Yale, Penn, and Parsons.
Here you are.
This must be our sixth and final intern.
Oh, I think there must be some mistake.
Daniel Humphrey, N.
Y.
U.
? I'm Epperly Lawrence, your supervisor.
Welcome to "w.
" Nothing says January like a brand-new cold war.
Hey.
Um, Mrs.
Humphrey? Oh, Jonathan, hello.
Eric left this in class the other day.
I thought he might need it.
Oh, that is so considerate.
Jonathan, how are you? I haven't seen you since you Eric and I broke up, probably.
Well, not that I see my son much these days either.
He's been with Elliot nonstop since they got back from Gstaad.
What? Elliot broke up with Eric over the holidays.
It's all anyone was talking about the first day back at school.
But Eric slept at his place last night.
Hey.
Brought you some coffee.
She looks a little lost.
Can I help you, miss? Um, no, thank you.
I'm just here to bring something to a friend, but I think I have the wrong address.
Is your friend an ex-con? Then you're in the right place.
This is a halfway house.
Focus on your work ethic, not your wardrobe.
"W" is about more than just fashion and beauty.
We do probing interviews, an art issue.
We're looking for visionaries.
Get out of here, Humphrey.
This is my world.
I can't just quit.
When Lily said cond nast, I figured she meant "Vanity Fair" or "The New Yorker, but that doesn't mean she didn't pull every string she had on my behalf.
Turns out it's easier to get a guy paroled than it is to get a magazine internship in this town.
You don't know the difference between Rodarte and road kill.
You'll be guillotined.
We're interns.
I may not know couture, but I know how to collate.
And I know how to staple, so stay out of my way, or I'll use one to attach your tongue to your shoulder blade.
Blair? I'm sorry.
Dan here was just telling me how much he'd love to work for "The New Yorker.
" Oh, that's right.
You're the writer.
Maybe you could do something special for our new blog we're announcing tonight at the party books, movies, "Fashion On Film.
" This month we'll be in celebration of contemporary authors, and Lynn Hirschberg's writing the intro.
I'll be sure to introduce you.
Wow.
Thank you.
Jonathan? What are you doing here? Where were you last night? And don't say Elliot's.
I called over there and spoke to his mother.
Well, I was with a friend.
Why didn't you tell me that you two broke up? I didn't wanna share a huge fact from my life.
I wonder where I got that gene from.
Now you listen to me Lily, can I maybe talk to Eric alone? Fine.
Are you okay? What's going on with you and your mother? Oh.
Now you care.
'Cause you didn't when you dumped me.
I was angry, and rightly so, but I've always cared, and you know that.
It's my family, and and Elliot, and it's just been A rough few weeks for me.
But I missed having you in my life.
Well, I'm here now.
Uh, your mother said you guys were going to some party tonight.
Is there any chance you'd wanna bring someone along to be there for you, help keep the peace? Make fun of everyone we see? Yeah, that sounds perfect.
No, I don't know.
There.
Okay, I'll let her know.
What'd he say? These strappy zanottis would look great with your sweaty gym socks.
Epperly asked me to pull the lemon Louboutins.
Oh.
You poor lost lamb.
Let me help you.
I didn't date Serena Van Der Woodsen for two years and not come away knowing that those are Marc Jacobs, and they're mustard.
Ugh! Why does this taste like chanel no.
5? Hey, I was, uh, just getting myself a cappuccino.
I thought you might like one, too.
The nutmeg foam that's a Humphrey touch.
My dad used to own a coffee bar.
Thank you, Daniel.
That's very thoughtful.
Who's got a stapler? Give it up, Blair.
I'm actually good at this, and unlike the other interns, I know you.
Your stupid tricks won't work.
Oh, look, it's Georgina's baby.
Ow.
Where have you been? I've been calling you.
Your parole officer told me you missed another job interview.
I didn't wanna tell ya until everything was settled.
I have incredible news.
I got a job a real job, as a financial advisor in a top tier company.
Are you serious? Dad, that's great.
I never thought it would happen again the suits, the business lunches, the ability to pay my own hotel bills.
I can't stop pinching myself.
What's the firm? Thorpe Enterprises.
I'll be working with Russell Thorpe himself.
See you later, pal.
Hey, Chuck.
Did I just walk past your dad in a $2,000 suit? Seems The Captain, who could barely get an interview for a custodial position, got a big executive job with the guy trying to buy your company.
So how are you enjoying your first day? Well, what should have been perfection has now been tainted by a run-in with Brookyln's Benedict Arnold.
How am I a traitor? The only reason you're still here is 'cause no one has ratted out your attempts at sabotage to Epperly.
And the only reason you're still here is because no one's asked you, "Who's Givenchy?" Lynn Hirschberg's flight from Dublin got canceled.
I knew Stefano should've made that Colin Farrell interview a phoner instead.
Hirschberg's out.
Major disaster.
Unless someone shows up with a new author and saves the day.
Yes.
And when she does, she will shine as the best intern.
And her insipid competition will be fired.
You do realize that I know Jeremiah Harris personally, right? And you do realize that I know everyone personally, right? Okay, so then we'll both show up with our authors tonight at the party, and whoever Epperly decides is the best fit for "W" wins.
The other resigns.
I can agree to that.
It's gotta be a clean fight.
Do you understand that as a concept? No sabotage? I can't wait to see you bleeding on the rack.
But yes, no sabotage.
Hey, is Eric here? I'm supposed to take him to lunch.
Oh, he's brooding in his room.
Here.
Vanya asked me to give this to you.
What is it? Everything okay, Lily? Yes, it's nothing.
I'll deal with it later.
Oh, come on, mom.
We're all trying to move forward here.
No more secrets.
Well, it's not a secret.
In fact, I have no idea what it is or who it's from.
Then what's the big deal about opening it in front of us? This was for Ben.
"Please use this money to start a new life far away from me and my family.
" Charming, mom.
Seems Serena's getting frosty with her mother over an envelope of cold-hard cash.
Looks like not everything or everyone's on sale this January.
Well, at least now I know why Ben lied.
He doesn't wanna have anything to do with me because I'm the daughter of the person that ruined the last three years of his life and is trying to ruin the rest of it.
$30,000 would hardly ruin his life.
You said you were gonna help Ben find an apartment, not pay him to disappear.
Mom paid someone off again.
Well, we should make this a drinking game.
Ben Donovan has information that can ruin this family.
What's wrong with not wanting him around? Because he's blameless.
Because he was a wonderful teacher who can't do what he loves thanks to you, and because he deserves more.
I'm going out.
I'm right behind you.
Yeah.
Hold the elevator.
Well, I did a little Humphrey smooth talking, and Jeremiah Harris said he'd be delighted to come, so I'm just gonna add his name to the list real quick.
Oh! Well, you can put him under Lorrie Moore, my author.
He'll be most comfortable there.
I don't think so.
Before Jeremiah Harris was a novelist, he wrote film reviews for "Vanity Fair," and he had a wine column in "Bon Appetit," and Stefano also knows him from "The Times.
" So? Lorrie Moore was a 2010 finalist for the P.
E.
N.
/Faulkner Award.
True.
Maybe she is a better get.
Oh, but did I mention that Jeremiah is on the board of admissions at Williams, where Stefano's niece is applying to college? So glad you called.
Afternooners are my favorite.
I thought you said you were totally aboveboard when it comes to business.
I did, and I am.
So why did you hire my best friend's father to work for your company? The Captain? He and my dad are old friends.
My father believes in second chances, and we need someone who knows the lay of the land.
His son's my roommate.
It's an obvious conflict.
Chuck, we just met.
I had no idea who you live with.
I know that you're sensitive to this, I assure you, Thorpe Enterprises has no interest in corporate espionage.
Even so, I spoke to Nate.
The Captain's a loose Cannon.
I'd consider it a personal favor if you'd have him fired.
Now what were you saying about afternooners? Actually I just remembered I have a meeting.
Sorry, Chuck.
Your mother might be up to her old tricks, but maybe it's best for Ben to get a fresh start without you.
Maybe.
I don't know.
I just don't want to go down without a fight.
Speaking of fights, I'm at full-on war with Humphrey.
B.
, I know you like to turn everything into a contest, but surely Dan isn't your biggest competition at "W" All the other girls are variations on a theme, and that theme slightly lesser versions of me.
But Dan is a writer.
He makes delicious coffee.
Never mind the fact that he's not a completely horrible-looking straight guy working at a fashion magazine.
He's got the whole office buzzing.
Sounds like someone's feeling a little threatened.
Well, not for long.
My author will make his look like a monkey with a typewriter Or maybe an invisible monkey with a typewriter.
B.
, I hear scheming in your voice.
You cannot sabotage him.
Why not? I'm not gonna treat him any better than all my other enemies just because you sporadically love him.
He's not your enemy.
Earn the spotlight on your own merits.
You'll feel better.
Well, I'll call you later.
Let Ben go? Let Dan be.
Oh, picking up a late lunch for Epperly? No.
Actually, it's for you.
Don't worry.
It's not poisoned.
I wouldn't wanna win due to my rival's starvation, and I figured you were too much of a food snob to deign to eat at the commissary.
And Epperly needs me to alphabetize.
Duty calls.
Fancy seeing you here, Mr.
Donovan.
Damien Dalgaard.
I heard you went to the pokey for poking a student.
Congratulations on getting out.
Sure you've been doing a lot of celebrating, yeah? Wanna buy some party favors? So it's true.
Straitlaced academic star became a dealer.
Guilty.
I remember that paper you wrote comparing "The Wire" to "The Iliad.
" Did not intend for English comp to be an occupational training course.
Well, you always said what we learned in high school would inform our futures in unexpected ways.
Yeah, the thing with "The Wire" is the witnesses usually had evidence before they testified.
I know you were the one who said you saw me and Serena at that b&b.
I told the truth.
Nothing happened between me and Serena that night, but I went to prison anyway.
You say "potato.
" Judge says "pedophile.
" Well, it's been great catching up, Mr.
D.
, but my friend just arrived.
I'd introduce you, but you may or may not have statutorily raped his sister.
Might be a tad awkward.
Let's go.
Get a table.
Good job today.
I think you could be a great fit here, provided you survive.
I try and stay out of the intern drama, but I couldn't help but notice your friend Blair's a little competitive.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I admire your loyalty.
Maybe the striver thing is all an act, and maybe it's just a coincidence that my coffee tasted like her perfume.
I'm sure you know her better than I do.
Yeah, I do know her.
I know that her kindergarten yearbook quote is "the best defense is a good offense.
" Hi.
Uh, Ms.
Moore, I'm an assistant at "w," and I'm afraid there has been a terrible mix-up.
Careful, D.
, it's flu season, but nothing's more contagious than mistrust.
Uh, where's mom? She's still licking her wounds.
We were all pretty hard on her this afternoon.
I Never would have come to a party like this without her, but I needed some air.
Oh, hey, I get it.
Being in a room with a selfish manipulator can really suck the life out of you.
She's worried.
She's just trying to protect her family.
Hey.
You two have a good time.
I'll see you later.
Are you hungry? There's appetizers.
Yes, yeah.
I'm gonna I'll grab us some, yeah? Thakery, Imoon, enjoy your treats.
Um, I need to talk to you.
Hi.
Chuck Bass and no guest.
You may enter.
Blair Waldorf working the door? I got an internship at "w.
" Knowing you, you'll be editor by may.
Your plan's working.
So it seems to be.
Ben, you came.
Thank you for meeting me here.
Can we talk? Serena, I'm actually here because I saw your brother Eric with Damien Dalgaard, who we both know is a drug dealer.
No.
No, no.
Eric hates Damien, and he doesn't do drugs, so there there must be some sort of explanation.
Jonathan.
Hey.
By any chance, have you seen Eric? Eric? No.
The guy should become a magician.
He disappeared.
I thought we were here on a date.
I guess I'm getting played once again.
I'm sorry.
A date? What about Elliot? Elliot dumped him.
He didn't tell you? He promised me he was over his Jenny Humphrey phase.
I guess he was wrong.
Or maybe I was, for believing him.
It'll be okay.
Come on.
Let's find him.
Lorrie is a bit late, but she'll be here any minute.
I hope Jeremiah brought his "a" game.
Oh, he's not here yet either.
Any reason you think he might be late? The guy is a famous recluse.
He might not show up at all.
It's your fault for picking him.
My fa oh, you've got ta be kidding me.
We said no sabotaging.
What are you talking about? Jeremiah.
Hi.
Mr.
Humphrey, show me to the bar.
I warn you, if the krug is warmer than 55 degrees, I'm leaving.
Jeremiah Harris? Epperly Lawrence.
Yes.
How do you do? Daniel told me you were in a bit of a bind.
Nice.
Let's get you a glass of champagne.
I'll tell you all about our plans.
O.
M.
G.
I was just poleaxed by a poor person.
Fancy seeing you here.
Chuck, this is Stuart Fuji.
He's in the film business.
Stuart, can I borrow her for a moment? What are you doing with that bore? Let's get out of here.
Actually, I'm having a nice time.
Stuart understands that when I say I'm telling the truth, I am.
Raina, you're trying to take my company.
How can I just trust you? You'd think less of me if I did.
I couldn't think less of you than I do right now.
Sorry.
I wouldn't be like this if it wasn't my father's legacy.
Stakes are too high to take a chance on trust.
Hey.
It's just business.
From now on, I don't even know if we have that to discuss.
Maybe Eric went home.
He doesn't really like parties anyway.
He can't be buying from Damien.
Come on.
Your sister just clocked us.
Okay, wh-what do we do? Just go with me on this one.
Well, I'm gonna go get a drink.
Would you like anything, babe? Uh So you're Damien's "babe" now? You Williamsburg weasel! I can't believe you stabbed me in the back.
I only did it because I thought you did the same to me.
Hillary Clinton is one of my role models.
I do not break treaties, you ass, but I do secure borders, so I'm gonna go tell Epperly what you did right now.
No.
Blair, wait.
Look, we can we can figure something out.
Let go of me, you classless cling-on.
Blair, do not go to Epperly.
I need this job, all right? No! Uh whoa.
Aah! Oh, no.
Oh, is that Stefano Tonchi.
I'm on the list.
Stefano, this way, please.
Spotted dubious friends in definite hot water.
Obviously, you're both fired.
Go back to the office and pack your things.
Looks like "W" just left Dan and Blair both out in the cold.
I just got an interesting phone call from Raina Thorpe.
Did you tell Chuck to have me fired? Let me guess.
Uh, you thought I'd embarrass you.
The Thorpe's were trying to take over Bass Industries.
We thought they might be using you just to get information.
I'm a grown man, Nate, and I'm actually good at what I do.
Chuck is family.
I would never do anything to jeopardize things for him.
You do realize that's a total contradiction, though, being Chuck's family and then working for the Thorpe's? Word around the office is that he's banging Thorpe's daughter.
Talk about sleeping with the enemy.
But that's Chuck's decision, okay? And whatever happens with Raina is on him and him alone.
You need the second chance.
You can't go down in another scandal.
So you're getting me fired instead? All those nights in prison, when I thought I couldn't take it, when I wanted to quit or die or I didn't, because I knew there was still one person out there who believed in me.
Dad, you'll get another job.
Yeah, washing toilets.
You know what? I think I'd rather live in a halfway house than live with someone who only halfway trusts me.
Come on.
It was just an internship.
I'm sure you can have your mother call and get you a new one in a second.
My mother didn't get me "w.
" She's a designer.
She can't call in favors from a fashion magazine.
Well, you don't get jobs like this without a connection.
Well, I did.
I practically stalked Stefano.
I spent the night at his lobby waiting to meet him.
And after the police escorted me out for the third time, I faxed a letter to every machine in the building.
That's like 200 fax machines.
Wow, Blair, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know any of this.
What, the fact that you were willfully ignorant is supposed to make me feel better? You wanted an internship.
I wanted this one.
So why didn't you just sabotage me? You had every opportunity.
Guess I must have some undiagnosed brain injury, because I stupidly thought that this fake friendship might be real.
Damien Dalgaard, of all people you know what kind of person he is.
Oh, so now you wanna get all sisterly? You're dating a demon.
Can't you see he's using you like he did Jenny? Why? 'Cause nobody could ever like me for me? Hey, I know what it feels like when you think you got no one to turn to.
Who the hell are you? I'm Ben, Serena's non-rapist but still technically ex-con former teacher.
You have taken up a lot of time over the dinner table at our house.
I'm sure all that drama has been overshadowing what's going on in everyone else's life, especially yours.
No offense, man, but mind your own business.
When I got locked up, I befriended some not very good guys.
Found out the hard way, when you do things that betray who you are, it can become very difficult to recognize yourself.
I don't wanna see that happen to you.
Please, Eric.
Mom did this awful thing, and and you went away to Ostroff, and I was looking so forward to just being away with Elliot and having somebody to talk to, and then he broke up with, and I didn't have anybody.
You always have me.
No, I didn't.
You were off chasing some judge, trying to help him.
I don't want to feel sad.
I didn't wanna feel anything, and the one thing about Damien is he is a good distraction, but You're right.
Thank you.
I won't see him anymore.
Um, Serena, can I speak to you? It's okay.
I gotta go anyway.
What Juliet did has it crossed your mind that Ben was at least partially responsible? He wanted revenge because he thought I put him in prison.
But that's in the past.
You know, he just gave Eric some really fatherly advice, helped convince him to stay away from Damien Dalgaard.
Damien? Look, I would love to explain, but I need to find Ben right now.
Epperly, uh, it's Dan Humphrey.
I know I ruined your party and humiliated your boss and there's no reason for you to want to listen to me right now, but I've got to tell you something.
Eric.
I just heard that you've been hanging out with Damien.
Are you doing drugs? You know, I could lie and say no.
Um but I bought sleeping pills.
And then I needed Adderall to wake back up, but that was it, and, um, it was stupid, and I'm done with it.
If you need help, I wanna make sure you get it.
No, I don't care about the drugs.
Damien was just there when no one else would listen.
Ben, wait.
Please don't avoid me.
I wanna be your friend.
Serena, it's a lot easier for me to start over without any reminders from my past.
But why? I saw you talking to Eric, and it reminded me of what you were like in boarding school.
I'm not that person anymore.
Yes, you are.
You wanna know why I've been avoiding you? Because I see that look in your eye, and I know exactly what it means.
But I don't wanna be with you.
I didn't reciprocate back then, and I don't now.
I'm sorry.
you'll be snuggling up with this winter are warm memories.
I'm not heartbroken.
I'm humiliated.
I was falling for someone who wants nothing to do with me.
And I thought I found my calling, and now the only thing that brings me any joy is planning Dan Humphrey's long, slow demise.
Epperly? It's 9:20.
Where are you? W-what are you talking about? You fired me.
Yes, and then Dan confessed that you were the one who called Jeremiah, and he took credit for it and then staged that whole wrestling stunt to embarrass you.
I was totally wrong about him.
If you're gonna be a backstabber, just stab some backs, you know? Are you saying That Alex White is styling eight looks today, and I need someone to steam the couture? Yes.
I'll be there in 15.
You know what I just remembered? If you really want something, you don't stop for anyone or anything until you get it.
Thanks for meeting me.
Serena told me how helpful you were with Eric yesterday.
Just saying what I thought.
Ben, I realize my wife hasn't treated you justly in any way.
I'd like to help.
You're not gonna offer me more money, are you? You deserve a real shot at getting back on your feet again, and that's gonna be tough to do living in a halfway house.
I have an extra room at my loft, and I-I'd love it if you moved in.
After everything that's happened, it's the least we can do.
I haven't experienced a lot of kindness lately.
I gotta think about it, but sounds good.
Take your time.
Hi.
Could you connect me to room 312, please? Howard Archibald.
What do you mean, he's checked out? Yeah.
This winter.
Thank you.
Even though we bundle up, a cold shoulder can freeze us out.
I heard about what young Bass asked Raina to do.
It's terrible.
Well, I'm just thankful she gave me the heads up and you gave me a chance to talk.
We're old friends, and you're doing a bang-up job.
I, uh, should've told you about my plans for Bass Industries, but I didn't wanna put you in a compromising position.
I completely understand, and I can assure you, there are no conflicts anymore.
Whatever you need, I'm your guy.
What are you doing here? I was wrong to ask you to fire The Captain.
Stuart, a moment? Yes, you were.
I told you who I was when we met.
I don't play games in business or in my personal life.
My father is gonna do everything humanly possible to acquire Bass Industries.
It's not a secret.
It's a fact.
I know.
I apologize for losing sight of that.
Look, you're a beautiful girl who says what's on her mind and isn't afraid of the consequences.
I don't want to stop seeing you.
I can handle the complications if you can.
Hmm.
I think complications are the least of what I can handle.
But There is a man In a towel in my bathroom right now.
So Maybe another time? You look good here.
Guess it turns out your friend wasn't worthy.
Tell me about it.
I've been trying to convince people for years.
But just so you know, he was never really my friend.
Sometimes a ray of sun shines in and gives us hope.
I offered Ben the apartment, and he's thinking about it.
Thank you so much, Rufus.
We're just not gonna take "no" for an answer.
Ben is still a good person.
I-I know he is.
Consider this a warning.
Stay away from Serena.
Stay away from her family.
I remember your father, and I think we both know how he would respond to your dealing if someone were to tell him.
What do you care, huh? Those people ruined your life, not me.
You actually like her.
How I feel about Serena is none of your damn business.
The only thing you should be worried about is disappearing.
Hey, what are you doing right now? Sorry, Damien, but I'm done with the pills.
No, that's not what I meant.
You wanna hang out? As friends.
But on the Upper East Side, the slipperiest ice Uh, sure.
Why not? Good.
Is usually right in front of us.
Good.

I got an internship at "W.

He shouldn't have been having an affair with a student.
He never touched me, mom.
You sent an innocent man to prison.
Ben, you came.
Can we talk? I see that look in your eye, and I know exactly what it means, but I don't want to be with you.
I realize my wife hasn't treated you justly in any way, but I'd like to help.
I have an extra room at my loft, and I'd love if you moved in.
My father's gonna do everything humanly possible to acquire Bass Industries.

I'd introduce you, but you may or may not have statutorily raped his sister.
Might be a tad awkward.
Consider this a warning.
Stay away from Serena.
Stay away from her family.
You wanna hang out? Sorry, Damien I'm done with the pills, all right? No, as friends.
Uh, sure.
Why not? And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

Then we've got no time to waste.
From a warm good-bye Ten things I need done in an hour.
Sorry.
Fashion Week is starting.
To a chilly hello.
You have no new messages.
From quiet solitude to surprise company.
Hi.
Can I help you? Hi.
I'm here for the home inspection.
Inspection for what? Ah, sorry we're late.
You must be Ben's parole officer.
The day waits for no one.
Better switch that thing off or bring it to bed.
Vibration's a terrible thing to waste.
I'm not yours no more.
Mm.
Sorry.
That's my dad.
What? I can't ignore his calls.
He's my boss, remember? How could I forget? Don't move.
Don't worry.
Hi, dad.
I'm just running late.
I'll be right there.
I gotta go.
Rain check.
Oh, no, no.
What's wrong? Just lost the ace for the kickoff party.
Have to find a replacement large enough for Florence And The Machine to perform, call the caterers, reroute the flowers and the gift bags.
That sounds like my kind of crisis.
What can I do to help? Stop distracting me with questions, for starters, and have you even finished your list? That's a "no.
" So I guess in addition to everything else I have to do this week, I will spend your entire performance review tomorrow discussing your inability to finish your tasks in a timely fashion.
No.
I can't tank my review.
This internship is everything, and I've been working hard.
Try to understand.
Epperly's under a lot of pressure.
Oh, please, I've celebrated more Fashion Weeks than birthdays.
I know how it is.
My mother's very high-strung.
In fact, in the years between her marriages, you wouldn't believe.
Wait a minute.
How long do you think it's been since Epperly had her strings plucked? Excuse me? Well, there's no shame in it.
It's just what happens when you're married to your job.
It's hard for a powerful woman to find the time.
Maybe all I have to do, to get Epperly off my back Is to get her on hers.
Last time I checked the intern packet, I don't think "pimp daddy" was included in the description of duties.
Well, it just so happens that Epperly's perfect partner also owns the perfect hotel to host tonight's kickoff party.
Ahh.
Two birds, one Bass.
Well, that's the grand tour.
Bedrooms in the back, kitchen's in the front.
'90s rock relics everywhere.
Well, everything looks good.
Ben, I'll see you at the end of the week, okay? This is a pretty great thing you and your family are doing.
So I really can't thank you enough, Rufus, for letting me crash in your old room.
And, Dan, I know this is a huge imposition, but I'm gonna do my best to stay out of your hair.
If at any time you want me gone, I am.
I'm sure it won't come to that.
The parole board would rather have you in a home setting.
So would we.
Hey, dad, can I talk to you for a second? I'm gonna go unpack my stuff.
Are you seriously letting Serena's stalker move in here? I told you last week this was a possibility.
Well, I didn't think you'd actually do it, especially without talking to me first.
I didn't think I needed your approval.
After everything he's been through, don't you think we owe it to him? Sure, by "we," you mean Lily.
Why doesn't he just move into Chuck's old room? And what do you plan on telling Serena about this? I'm sure she's not gonna be okay with it.
Actually, she's more than okay with it.
It was her idea.
Hey.
Hey.
Uh, I already got the tickets and the ginger-sesame-caramel popcorn, so.
Yeah, I don't think I can make the movie today, man.
Oh.
Um, all right, well, let's We'll just grab a coffee then.
No.
I think I gotta get out of town for a few days, maybe even longer.
Since when? Why? Since recently and for reasons I'm not at liberty to discuss.
Seriously? Yeah.
Oh, come on.
You know you can trust me with anything.
I mean, the amount of crazy crap that people tell me and expect me to keep to myself, all all the drama about my mom and Serena and Ben.
Maybe that's the reason I can't tell you.
Because it's about Ben? Damien, if you know something about him, you gotta tell me.
Rufus just moved him into the loft.
Ben's living with Dan now.
Nice.
Okay.
The other morning, Ben jumped me.
What happened? I don't know.
He he just went nuts.
Told me if I didn't get lost, he was gonna tell my dad I was dealing.
You don't know my dad, Eric.
If he finds out, I am done.
Okay, that's crazy.
I mean, if anyone should have to leave the city, it's its Ben, not you.
That guy is dangerous, and I do not want him around my family or my friends.
Look, don't go yet.
I'm gonna figure something out.
Did I hear Raina just leave? What is that, three days in a row now? Things are getting serious.
Not fast enough.
We're stuck in this meaningless mind-blowing s*x loop.
Aw, I'm sorry to hear that.
Raina's the one person that can stop her father from swallowing up Bass Industries.
I need her to fall for me so she'll spare my company.
Yeah, well, she doesn't strike me as the love-at-first-sight type, so just give it some time.
Time is the one thing I don't have.
One of my corporate weasels informed me that their board is voting tonight at Once that happens, Bass Industries is toast.
I need to up my game.
No pun intended.
Hello? Anybody home? Epperly, meet my good friend Chuck Bass.
Nice to meet you, Mr.
Bass.
That's Nate.
Chuck, we need a favor.
The magazine lost its space for the kickoff party tonight, and Epperly and I both agree The Empire would be the perfect replacement.
Sadly, The Empire is spoken for, but The Palace is available.
The Palace would lend an air of old-world sophistication to the evening.
I'd have to check with Florence's manager.
Do you have a stage? They'll have one by tonight.
Okay.
I can get behind that.
And that brings me to another point of business.
Nate, would you show Epperly the view from the roof? It's something you must see.
Excellent idea.
I need to speak to Blair alone for a moment.
Looks like our favorite Upper East sinners just found the answer to their prayers.
I need your help.
Lucky for us, their road to heaven leads straight through hell.
Hey.
Dorota told me you were here.
Yeah, I came by to check on Eric.
With my mom away, I knew he wouldn't run into her, but turns out he's gone, too.
Want a berry? Oh, no, thanks.
I already had breakfast with my new roommate Ben.
What were you thinking? That he deserves a second chance.
Oh, to what, to drug you and leave you for dead in a motel room again? That wasn't Ben.
That was Juliet, and you know it.
And now she's off doing independent study somewhere, and I don't even think they talk anymore.
Look, I understand that you feel badly about what happened and what Lily did, but you can't forget that this guy spent the past six months out to get you.
Ben was a good guy before all this happened, and if you kept an open mind, you'd see that he still is.
You'd see what I see.
Oh.
Wow.
What? You have feelings for this guy.
No.
Not that it's any of your business.
It doesn't matter how I feel or don't feel about Ben.
He's made it perfectly clear he wants nothing to do with me.
I haven't even heard from him since the "W" party.
Yeah.
I guess I'm way off base.
Hey.
Serena, what's going on? Two guys from newel just showed up here with a bookcase from Ms.
Van Der Woodsen? Uh, I can explain.
I'll be right there.
Hey.
There you are.
I have to go now.
I'll call you later.
Wh Where's she going? To see Ben.
That's not a good idea.
Tell me about it.
What do you mean? Well, contrary to what Rufus and Serena believe, he hasn't changed.
He beat up a friend of mine just last week.
We have got to get rid of this guy, show everybody how dangerous he is.
What can I do for you? Epperly, my boss.
Fashion Week just started, so she's a stress case, but my performance review is tomorrow, and I need it to go well.
Surely saving tonight will earn you the gold star you crave.
No, it will calm her for a nanosecond until she finds something else to stress about.
I believe that only one thing can relax Epperly, and it's something that I can't give to her.
You need to turn that frown upside down before she pulls out the grading pencil.
And you're just the man for the job.
I'm not sure I am.
I've spent the last few weeks trying every trick I know in the bedroom to get Raina to fall in love with me Business reasons, of course.
Nothing seems to be working.
That's because that's how you win a guy's heart, not a girl's.
If you want Raina to fall for you, you have to stop pulling on her drawstrings and start pulling on her heartstrings.
And where are they located, exactly? In a common connection.
You and I bonded over a mutual love of scheming And burlesque.
Find something that you and Raina both share.
Let your guard down.
Show her a side of you that no one else sees.
I hear girls love that.
Open up, and she'll be forced to follow suit.
And once you hook her, reel her in, gut her emotionally and throw the carcass overboard.
You really do have a gift.
So it's a deal.
If I'm focused on Raina, I can't expend energy on Epperly.
That is not fair.
I give you gold and you can't spare two hours? Think of her as an amuse-bouche.
You were right, Blair.
The view is great up there.
It's so pretty.
Nate I was just saying how you should come with me and Epperly to lunch.
Yeah, sure, I'll go to lunch, as long as Epperly doesn't mind.
No, I'd love that.
So I'm sure Ben was a perfectly nice guy when Serena met him, but you lock anybody up for three years.
Yeah, for a crime he didn't commit.
I've seen every episode of "OZ.
" That place can change a man.
All right, so where's this friend of yours? Hey.
Damien is your friend? Just hear him out, all right? Eric, the guy's a drug dealer.
Who helped you and Blair find Juliet as soon as he realized Serena got hurt.
Humphrey, personal differences aside, Ben is dangerous.
We all know that.
We need to work together to expose him before it's too late.
No.
No.
My answer's "no.
" I'm not gonna team up with the one guy I trust less than Ben, and neither should you.
Did you remember to add the prospectus? If I say no, will you stop asking me? The I's are dotted, and the T's have been crossed.
We're ready.
We need a unanimous vote tonight, Raina.
Anything less, and the Bass board will sense weakness and put up a fight.
Speak of the devil.
Russell.
You have a beautiful hotel here.
I was just taking a look around.
With Raina by your side, of course.
Smile, shake hands, send a message to the Bass board that Thorpe Enterprises cares about the future of these properties.
Set them at ease.
Ah.
I never thought of that.
Hmm.
Okay, do I need to be here for this? You're right.
Where are my manners? If you'd like the real tour, you can start with lunch at our restaurant.
I, uh, have to get back to the office, but I think it's nice.
A Bass and a Thorpe to be seen working together, breaking bread.
Besides, there's nothing my daughter doesn't tell me.
Shall we? Oh, I'm I'm so sorry.
I just I thought Don't apologize.
Just return it.
I already called the delivery guys.
I can return this, too.
I can't believe you remembered.
I remember everything you've read to me.
In case you haven't noticed, I don't really let go of things so easily.
I guess I could use something to keep me company at night, but the bookshelf still goes.
I was about to go out and get some lunch.
You wanna join me? I don't wanna raid the Humphreys' pantry, but I'm kinda starving.
Well, I told the delivery guys I'd be here, so why don't we order in, if that's okay with you? I know where the menu book is.
So, Epperly, have you always worked in fashion? Pretty much.
After Oxford, I worked at the met for Harold Koda at the Costume Institute.
Ah, yeah.
But more importantly, you were a power pilates instructor.
For one semester in college.
But it still counts.
Core strength lasts a lifetime.
This is Epperly.
What do you think? She's cool.
Uh-huh.
What else? She's smart, stressed about work.
Where are you going with this? Whoa.
You need to sleep with her right away.
What? I need you to relieve all that pent-up tension before my first performance review tomorrow, and you better not be selfish, Archibald.
You know what I mean.
A woman remembers.
This is why you've been dragging me around? Well what's the big deal? It's not like you haven't done it before.
Just think of her as younger, more flexible lady Catherine.
Trouble.
Florence is stuck at J.
F.
K.
Because The Machine's flight is delayed.
Well, Epperly, it's fine.
We'll send another car.
Why don't you two grab lunch, and I'll go get a jump on it at "W"? No, I need to deal with this myself.
I'll see you back at the office.
I wasn't that selfish, was I? Was I? You were right.
Lunch was pretty amazing.
You'll have to tell Justin when you see him.
He's our executive chef.
Thank you, Daniel.
The service was impeccable as always.
Thank you so much, Mr.
Bass.
That's the third waiter you've greeted.
Chuck, I know you're trying to make me feel guilty about buying The Palace and firing all these nice people, but business is business.
You know that.
What's with the show? It's not a show.
I actually grew up here.
Other kids have neighbors and potlucks.
I have concierges and room service.
I know these people because they're my extended family.
I guess I shouldn't expect you to understand.
Actually, I do.
When my mother abandoned us, my dad couldn't sleep in our house anymore.
So he moved us into the penthouse of the Blake, and we never left.
Nothing like being a guest in your own home.
Let me take you out tonight.
There's a party here, then after maybe we can Some other night? I have a meeting I can't miss.
In fact Oh, my God.
I didn't realize the time.
I'm gonna get my coat.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay, you have to try a shishito pepper.
Absolutely not.
My mouth is still on fire from the spicy tuna roll.
Now please pour me some tea before I literally start to cry.
Okay, okay.
Look, I'm sorry that I've been how I've been.
I just I've spent the last three years blaming you for where I thought you put me.
I know, here you are somewhere else that I put you.
Is that a problem? No, actually.
I'm beginning to think I'm supposed to be here.
How's everybody doing? I should get going.
What are you doing? Leaving.
What is it gonna take for you to see this is a dangerous situation? What is it gonna take for you to see it isn't? We're not dating, so if it's all the same, I don't need your permission or protection.
Look, Dan, I know you're just looking out for Serena, and I understand your concern.
I do.
But you have nothing to worry about.
I swear.
Watch out, lonely boy.
Your new roommate's moving in fast, but you're the one who's going to have to unpack his lies.
Raina's remarkable.
I've honestly never been with a girl who understands me like she does.
No, today was just hard because I was showing her The Palace.
I know pretty soon it's all gonna be gone.
It's the one place that still feels like home.
I thought Raina would understand that.
No, I am so sorry, Epperly.
I really thought that you and Nate would hit it off.
No, of course it's not you.
No, don't blame yourself.
He said he thought you were beautiful.
He's just coming off a really crazy relationship, you know? No, I know.
He's as smart as he handsome, isn't he? Don't push it.
Wrap it up.
Oh.
Okay.
Well, I'll see you back at work, Epperly.
Hey.
I'll walk you to your car.
Thanks.
You know, I think I might like to see this place at night.
Honestly, it's your loss, Archibald.
Okay, so maybe I was too quick to say no about Epperly, but there's no harm in hanging out with her at the party now, is there? No harm at all.
Hey.
Hey, Serena.
Look, I gotta run.
I'll see you tonight, okay? Bye.
You're at home during the day with Nate? Do I smell a scheme? No, I'm just grabbing a quick bite and a change of clothes for the party.
And you're not coming from school, are you? No.
I saw Ben.
He called me, and we had lunch, and I don't know.
I think there really might be something there.
Am I crazy? Please don't say "yes.
" Bad boys have never really been your thing, but damaged outsiders are a definite weakness.
What do you mean? He's from a different social class.
Your mother hates him.
He hates your mother.
He's living in a loft in Dumbo.
I knew Ben before I ever met Dan.
Not my point.
Just ask yourself this.
Is it Ben or the idea of him? Taking off.
I'll see you later.
Hey, uh, glasses middle shelf.
Salad plates bottom shelf.
That's the way it's been my entire life, which is how long I've lived here with my family.
Listen, man, I know you're not too thrilled to have me staying here.
Picking up on that, huh? Little bit.
Look, when your dad offered me a place to stay, I had no idea that you were living here.
If you want me gone, don't rattle dishes.
Just tell me.
I never meant for Juliet to do what she did.
I've even told her to give me some space.
Well, maybe you should tell her again.
I saw she called you.
Because it's my mom's birthday.
That's the only reason.
Like it or not, they're the only family I have.
I'm not gonna lose them.
But it's okay for Serena to lose hers? She's already cutting herself off from her mother and Eric over what happened.
If you really cared about her, you wouldn't make her choose between you or them.
Yeah, 'cause that's what you did when you guys were together.
Are you saying you guys are together now? That's her, isn't it? Hey.
Hey.
So I know it's last minute, but I was wondering if you wanted to come with me to the "W" party tonight.
Party? Tonight? You know, if you'd asked me an hour ago, I would've said that's not such a good idea, but, uh you know what? I'm in.
Great.
I can't wait to see you.
Great news.
Nate is coming to the kickoff party tonight.
And he's very excited to see you.
That's great.
Too bad I won't be there.
Why not? Clearly the party has been a logistical nightmare, and my phone hasn't stopped ringing, and I can't miss a call.
Cinderella doesn't always get to go to the ball.
Well, she can if she has all her calls forwarded to her Blackberry and an able intern by her side the whole time.
I'm not saying to blow off your responsibilities, but if anything goes wrong, how can you fix it from here? It's not a good idea.
You can still do your job and have a fabulous night at the same time.
Nate can't wait to see you.
Trust me.
It's like riding a very cute bike.
All right, but we have to leave now.
Here's my phone.
Do your forwarding magic.
Different ringtones for different lines? Careful, B.
Your boss's phone is ringing off the hook, and it's your job on the line.
There's Nate.
Let's go say hi.
Maybe I should go make sure the gift bags are being set out properly.
I'm sure that they're fine.
If anyone needs to reach you, you have your phone.
Come on.
Look alive.
Ladies.
Epperly, care to join me at the bar? Go get her.
So you go to things like this every week? If you don't like it, we can leave.
I just thought the music would be good? Oh, no.
I'm I'm looking forward to it.
You thirsty? Yes, please.
I missed my meeting.
Was I worth it? I'll let you know.
I took the liberty of reserving my old suite.
Perhaps after the show, we can continue your tour upstairs.
Only on the condition that you show me something first.
Your hiding place from when you were a little boy.
Did Nate tell you? I grew up in a hotel, too, remember? So can I see it? It wouldn't be so secret if I just showed it to you.
Fine.
I guess I'll just have to find it myself.
Whoa! Watch where you're going, man.
Watch where you're going! Damien, what are you Doing here? This is a party.
I go to these.
You not so much.
I thought I told you to stay away from him.
Or what? Huh? Not here.
You name the place.
I'll be there.
Get out of my way.
That's not what we planned.
You said he had a short fuse.
Damien baited Ben.
He just didn't bite.
Eric said you met his parole officer? Yeah.
Why? You should call him.
Parolee's about to get violent at a private event.
To be clear, I'm doing this for Serena, and if you turn out to be lying about Ben, I will make sure that you never set foot in this town again.
Understood.
I'll be back.
Well What's this for? Your hand in about three minutes.
You're gonna punch me in the face as hard as you can.
Blair, have you seen Epperly? Yes, and I can hear my performance review now.
Check plus, check plus, check plus You don't understand.
The party planner delivered all the gift bags to the old location.
Well, I'm sure she can fix it.
She's right over there.
I don't understand.
Where'd she go? Warmer? Scalding.
Excellent.
Under the table.
Or In the corner By the shelf.
The corner how on earth did you know that? I hid in the same place.
You can see everyone, but no one can see you.
I even carved my name in the wall with a salad fork.
The old wood floor was replaced by tile in the last Reno.
Otherwise, I could've shown you my work.
See? I know you better than you know yourself.
I know how much The Palace means to you.
It's your home.
I think I can keep you from losing it.
Raina Before we go any further, there's something I have to tell you.
Don't bother.
Allow me.
Dad, wh-what are you doing here? I should ask you the same question.
How dare you miss the meeting.
I told you, we needed a unanimous vote.
I'm sorry.
But I'm not even sure if we should buy Bass Industries anymore.
Raina one of Chuck's associates called our chairman tonight.
Chuck knew about the vote.
He kept you away on purpose.
Is this true? No, I wish you guys could have seen it.
Hey, Ben, I want you to meet Shala, Humberto, and Jen.
Hi.
How are you? Humberto.
Uh, look, I think I'm gonna take off.
Oh, I'll come with you.
No, you should stay.
I mean, your family's here Eric, what are you doing here with Damien? What happened to your face? Ben.
He threatened me earlier, and then he followed me to the bathroom, and then he jumped me.
Eric, are you kidding me? There's no way.
No, he did it.
I saw it myself.
Don't even try to deny it.
I can see that look on your face.
Sorry, S.
, your new beau may have the right to remain silent but you just became the talk of the town.
I don't understand.
It doesn't make any sense.
Why would Ben just come and hit you unprovoked? The guy's obviously got some serious anger issues.
And his parole officer just happened to be here? Come on.
No, I called him.
Because you knew that he'd hit Damien? Because I knew he was a danger to you, to me, to anyone he came into contact with.
I tried to tell you all this, but you wouldn't listen to me.
Because I don't believe it, and I don't believe you.
Serena, wait.
Wait.
Did you really know our board meeting was tonight? Tell me the truth.
Yes.
Raina, when we first met, I was so desperate to save my father's company.
I didn't care what it took, who I had to betray.
I thought if you fell for me, you might find a way to spare it.
But after spending today together, I realized how much I actually do care about you.
I'm so sorry, Chuck.
There's nothing you can ever say to make me trust you again.
My father's waiting for me.
I won't be able to get you in front of a judge till morning.
Let me guess.
You're not springing for a room at this place.
This is serious, Ben.
I'd hoped for better from you.
Wait! Stop.
You're making a mistake.
Serena, don't.
I know you didn't do anything.
Tell him.
Nate, where's Epperly? We're having a gift bag crisis.
How should I know? She left with this guy she knew from Oxford.
What? How could you let some toff just punt off with her? He's definitely gonna try and hook up with her.
You should've heard this guy's accent.
Epperly was right.
You can't take your eye off the ball.
I need to fix this.
Let's go.
You are gonna help me get 650 gift bags from 29th Street in 20 minutes, or so help me, Archibald, I will tell everyone what your favorite movie is.
Hey, do not knock "The Sound Of Music.
" It's got nuns and Nazis.
Julie Andrews was hot.
So I say we go back to your place, pop in some "Call Of Duty" and celebrate.
Listen, man, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I think we're pretty much done here.
I don't understand.
I I thought we were friends.
You're my client.
Former client, actually.
So you were just using me to find out where Ben was so you could get rid of me? And now he's gone, and so am I.
See ya.
You heard what happened? Are you seriously mad at me now? Well, I can't say I'm entirely pleased.
You put Max Cady in my living room.
What was I supposed to do? I guess I didn't realize how deeply you felt about it.
I know you got a lot on your plate right now.
It's gotta be hard for you to be caught in the middle like this.
Well, I'm sorry I didn't ask you first.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
Uh, you were.
Ben didn't hit Damien I-I did.
Oh, my God.
Spotted a lonely boy trying to save an innocent man.
Looks like Brooklyn's the one who's guilty By association.
Hey, have you talked to Eric? He wasn't here when I got up.
I wouldn't be surprised if he was off somewhere with Damien I don't know what to do, how to get through to him.
It's gonna be okay.
I'm meeting with Nate.
We're gonna take care of it.
Uh, I've gotta call you back.
I don't know where to begin.
How about "I'm sorry"? I didn't think that would be enough.
I'm pretty easy.
Well, then I'm sorry.
Honestly, I don't know what I was thinking.
I was jealous.
I was angry.
I cost you a night in jail.
What's one more after three years? Thank you for calling my P.
O.
, setting the record straight.
I'll pack up my stuff.
No, you don't have to move out.
In fact, I would like you to stay.
I realize you're someone I should trust, just like Serena said I should.
She said that? Yeah.
If you don't believe me, you can ask her yourself.
Hey.
Dan invited me to come over and wait for you.
She was right.
I was wrong.
Just give everyone else some time.
They'll come around.
I need to go meet Nate.
Where have you been? I was just getting coffee at Sicaffe.
I-I got you one, too.
You should know that, um, Dan and Nate are on their way over to Damien's to look for you.
Yeah, well, Damien ditched me after the party, so Strongest drug I'm on is double macchiato.
Are we done? No, no, no.
We're not.
Talk to me.
Make me understand why you wanna spend so much time with a guy like him when you have all your other friends.
What other friends? Can't believe I'm gonna say this out loud.
It sounds so stupid, but I I thought Damien got me.
You know, we could just hang out together and do nothing.
He was there for me.
That kind of a guy always is.
Yeah.
Yeah, well Lesson learned.
Thank you.
For what? A speechless Chuck Bass.
Will wonders never cease? Honestly, I never thought you'd talk to me again.
Neither did I.
But then I got a phone call from your friend Blair.
Not a staged call a real one.
She told me you may have said all those things on the phone with her for the wrong reasons.
But that you also meant them.
When it comes to me, Blair has a nasty habit of never being wrong.
She said the same thing.
So I've decided to ignore my better judgment and give you a second chance.
If you ever lie to me again.
You have my word.
Business is business.
You need to do what's right for Thorpe Enterprises.
I'll find another way to save my family legacy One that doesn't involve you.
I would But I can't right now.
I have a meeting.
Dinner tonight? Room service.
Epperly's been in with Stefano for over an hour.
But it was just gift bags.
And we still got them there on time.
This is all my fault.
I wanted Epperly to get laid, not laid off.
Did you get fired? Of course not.
The party was a huge success.
Are you having a psychotic break? No, but I am taking a break.
I quit.
Blair, at the party, I ran into the guy that I dated when I was living in London, and we spent the whole night together just talking.
And he is heading off to Bali to a yoga retreat, and I decided I want to go with him.
You're leaving the magazine for "Eat Pray Love"? I guess you can't have it all.
No, of course you can.
Don't quit.
You're amazing at your job.
I know, and you will be, too.
What? As a token of my appreciation for helping me see what was missing in my life, I suggested that you be promoted to replace me.
Congratulations.
Stefano's giving you a trial run, starting now.
This is the office, international, Stefano only.
Now your day begins every morning at 6:00 A.
M.
No, no, I am a full-time student.
I go to Columbia.
If James Franco can do it, so can you.
Blair, you wanted it all, and you just got it.
They say the universe has a great sense of humor, that sometimes having your dreams come true can feel like a nightmare.
The board is waiting for us.
Raina, after last night, I need to ask if I have your full support to buy Bass Industries.
Yes, under one condition.
Name it.
After the deal closes, I want you to give Chuck a chance to be part of the new company.
I don't need Chuck's help to run Bass Industries.
Yes, you do.
You just don't know it yet.
Because getting what you want always comes with strings attached.
Archibald, Humphrey.
What are you guys doing here? Well, we came looking for Eric.
We ran into your dad instead.
He's a nice guy.
I mean, at least he was to us.
How he is to you after what we told him might be a different story.
Wait.
You guys realize what you've done? My dad's gonna cut me off! And even when you think you're finally in the clear, you're never home free.
You haven't slept.
I couldn't, not until I knew you were safe.
Last night at the party when everyone else doubted you, I never did, not for a second, and I never will.
What about your family? What if us being together drives them all away? I don't think it will, but that's a risk I'm willing to take if you are.
Every happy ending is just a new beginning Because on the Upper East Side, the good times never last forever.
Gossip Girl here.
Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan elite.
I thought we were friends.
Damien ditched me after the party, so Strongest drug I'm on is double macchiato.
I have decided to set my sights on Bass lndustries.
It's not just his disloyalty.
It's his pomposity.
And the fact that you slept with him? Oh, well, that was a long time ago, and it was fleeting.
You wanted an internship.
I wanted this one.
I stupidly thought that this fake friendship might be real.
I suggested that you be promoted to replace me.
Blair, you wanted it all.
You just got it.
I got a phone call from your friend Blair.
So I've decided to give you a second chance.
You need to do what's right for Thorpe Enterprises.
I want you to give Chuck a chance to be part of the new company.
I don't need Chuck's help to run Bass lndustries.
Yes, you do.
What about your family? What if us being together drives them all away? I don't think it will, but that's a risk I'm willing to take if you are.
It's cold out there, but on the Upper East Side, things are heating up, because Valentine's Day is around the corner.
Please don't tell me you're leaving already.
Between classes at Columbia or your job at "W.
" the only proof that I have you still exist is the faint trace of Chanel in the morning.
I'm so sorry, S.
But if I can turn this into a permanent job, it'll knock 6 months off my 2-year plan.
Are you sure you're not just burying yourself in work to avoid thinking about tomorrow? Tomorrow? I don't even know what day today is.
Last year, Chuck and I honored Valentine's Day by staging our very own bacchanal.
And no, there were no goats, if that's the look that just fluttered across your face.
But this year, I'm sitting out "V" day to focus on my career, as is Chuck with his fake relationship with Raina Thorpe.
Right, but I thought you reached out to Raina and told her that Chuck's feelings were real.
He needed to get back in her good graces, and I knew exactly how to get him there.
Chuck and I may need some time to forge our own paths before we risk a romantic rejoining, but we're still there for each other.
And what about you and Ben? It must be very special for him, spending Valentine's Day with someone other than his cellie.
We decided to sit it out, too.
We just started dating.
It's too much pressure.
Hey, why don't you and I have a friends Valentine's Day? Manis, macaroons, massages? Uh, it sounds amazing.
I'll let you know.
But if the 2-year plan wins out, will you be okay? I'll be fine.
I'm glad you agreed to this brunch with Chuck and Lily.
It shows a lot of good faith on their part.
I mean, we came in with guns blazing, and they responded with an olive branch.
More like olive bread.
I agreed to a meal, Raina.
That's it.
I don't trust the Basses.
They don't operate like we do.
They're a family, just like us.
The Lily I remember didn't have a maternal bone in her body.
Family was just about money and power.
Well, I hope hosting this brunch proves to you once and for all I have the company's best interests at heart.
And also elegantly forces the enemy to come to you.
Yes, Sun Tzu is right beside Emily post on my bookshelf.
But, Charles, don't let your feelings for Raina affect your judgment.
We have to be careful with the Thorpes.
Believe me, I know.
Don't worry.
I'm not banking on their sympathy.
Welcome.
So is anyone hungry? How's the job search going? I think the check the "have you ever committed a felony?" box limits my options.
But yours seem to be improving.
I'm sorry if I overstepped.
The article was just sitting there.
Being single while living with the guy seeing your ex? We nailed the awkwardness.
Yeah, well, it's very fresh.
It's a good thing Serena and I decided not to do anything for Valentine's Day.
I can't afford to take her out anyway.
Well, you already read how awkward I feel about this, but, um, with me, she was always happy to just play pool and drink beer.
Right now I couldn't even afford to do that.
Uh well, you know what? I used to work for a catering company.
They could always use an extra hand around a holiday.
I could make a call.
It's good money.
And and no offense, but judging from my past coworkers, I think they have the "don't ask, don't tell" policy regarding felons.
Uh, thanks.
Appreciate that.
Uh, and, you what's next for the article? Uh, well, I e-mailed my Conde' Nast contact, Epperly, but I got an auto response saying she doesn't work there anymore, so I gotta I gotta Facebook her.
I don't know about the cater-waiter me, but the teacher me thinks maybe you should step out from behind the computer and find out who the new Epperly is and give her the article in person.
Huh.
The new Epperly.
I hadn't thought about that.
As part of W's" online expansion, Stefano wants to kick off a new feature Bright young thing.
We'll follow an "It" girl one night a month as she navigates the Manhattan social scene.
Our inaugural "It" girl needs to be special, as should her Valentine's Day plans.
Blair, you're friends with Serena Van Der Woodsen? Yes.
Well, D, Serena definitely is "It," but what if there was someone fabulous that we could break ourselves? Someone like Raina Thorpe.
Daughter of Russell? I like it.
Keep going.
Well, she's typically shunned publicity, which makes her an even bigger get.
So if I could come through I'd recommend Stefano consider your trial period over.
I'll have her by lunch.
Hey.
How well do you know Raina Thorpe? Um, not at all.
Do you know where she is right now? I'm guessing you do.
At your house.
Where my mother lives.
No way.
We're still at war.
And why are you asking anyway? Because I need to do a story on Raina for the magazine tomorrow night.
Okay, well, why don't you just ask her yourself? After the Chuck thing, doesn't she owe you a favor? Yes, but she's not answering her phone, and I can't leave the office.
Besides, it's better this way.
Just two "It" girls talking.
And explain that you'll do the profile yourself.
Right, because this is all really just a favor to me and not a convoluted way for you to keep your eye on Raina and Chuck on Valentine's Day? Mm, I hadn't thought of that.
Thank you! Lily, everything was delicious, especially the eggs.
Ah, Spanish tortilla.
That's perfect after a late night or a breakfast in bed after too much Rioja.
Thank you, Russell.
Um, here in America, we call it a frittata.
Did I just hear your dad laugh? I told you this would work.
I'm going in.
Okay.
Mr.
Thorpe, we're all very grateful we have found a buyer for Bass lndustries that we can all approve of.
And though it may be your instinct to keep the company under the Thorpe umbrella, that might be a mistake.
The Bass name has equity.
I'd like the chance to prove that all in one night Tomorrow, to be exact.
I've leased a landmark mansion outside the city.
It's a destination.
You travel to get there, and the reservations are made before.
And what do people get when they arrive? Imagine you're at a club.
Forget the year, the continent.
You don't want the night to end.
In this case, it doesn't have to.
When the time is right, you drift upstairs to a private room.
Spend the night or just a few hours.
It's up to you.
But, uh, what makes you think people will show up? It sounds like you need a big marketing push just to get the word out.
No marketing.
I say where and when, people show up.
If I can prove to you the Bass brand has a quantifiable worth, will you look at my business plan? It shows how you can keep the company together under the Bass name, with my involvement.
I'll put a pin in my current plans for If this thing you've planned succeeds, we'll talk.
You nailed it.
I'll see you at the hotel, dad.
Serena.
We weren't expecting you.
I'm here to see Raina.
Hey, we haven't officially met, but our mutual friend Blair Waldorf wants to talk to you.
She'll explain everything.
Um Blair has to follow a socialite around on Valentine's Day.
It's for work, she figured you wouldn't mind since everything with Raina is, you know I know what? Oh.
Blair was wrong.
You do have feelings for Raina.
I do.
I have something spectacular planned for tomorrow night.
Uh-oh.
B's in for a shock when she finds out what she thought was as fake as a c.
Z.
Is actually as real as Harry Winston.
Oh, my gosh.
All the shoppers on Madison are so stressed.
It's like the entire future of humanity lies in the balance.
"Should I get him boxers or cologne?" "Are red roses cliche?" "If I hide the ring in her food, will she choke?" I'm so happy we're sidestepping Valentine's.
You sure? It's not very romantic.
Speak for yourself.
I have a hot date with my blu-ray player.
What about you? What are you doing? Believe it or not, I am working.
Really? Ben, that's great.
Where? Uh, it's nothing big, but it's a start.
Oh, let me guess.
Uh, at a publishing house? Tutoring service? Um you're doing research for a Professor? You'd be so good at that.
Uh I how'd you know? So which one is it? Tutoring.
Well, all you have to do is get one kid into an Ivy, and your phone will be ringing off the hook.
I have to go meet a friend, but I'll see you on the 15th when all this craziness is over.
Happy tutoring.
Thanks.
Uh, I'll talk to you later.
Hey, there you are.
Listen, we need to talk to you.
Not now, Archibalds.
Russell bit.
My party tomorrow needs to be legendary if I'm going to secure my place after the takeover.
Forget it.
Whatever Russell Thorpe promised you is a lie.
I think I'll take my advice from someone not interested in grinding an ax across my knuckles, if you don't mind.
After you and Nate tried to get me fired, I realized that your actions weren't completely unwarranted, so I asked to be taken off of all Bass business, and Thorpe agreed.
But this morning I was copied on a report I shouldn't have been.
It was a breakdown of how Russell's gonna sell your company for parts and who he's selling them to.
Your intel's stale.
We brokered a deal at brunch.
Russell promised to postpone those meetings.
Just confirmed one an hour ago.
And something else.
I dug around accounting.
Bass lndustries is more profitable kept whole.
So why is Thorpe determined to slice it up? Russell didn't become a billionaire by making money-losing decisions.
Look, you told me he had issues with Bart, right? So maybe it isn't a business decision.
Maybe it's personal.
So you sound pretty excited about tomorrow, like maybe it's not just another night of hanging out with Chuck, business as usual? I guess that's true.
At first, it was purely for the s*x.
Oh, that's Chuck.
No, I meant me.
Chuck was just trying to get me to help him with my father.
"Was"? But now? Things have gotten kind of serious.
I wanna find an amazing dress and totally take his breath away.
Oh, well, that that does sound serious.
So how about a little help? It's overwhelming.
Oh, well, the secret about these places is that they always keep the best stuff in the back, which is why I called ahead.
What do you think? Ohh.
Wow.
That's the one.
Our work here is done.
No need to try this one, even though I love the detail.
I actually really love this dress.
Then try it on.
You can wear it tomorrow to the club.
Oh, no, I wish, but I have other plans.
Something's better than a Chuck Bass party? If Serena Van Der Woodsen isn't going, maybe he was exaggerating the value of his so-called brand.
No, it's not that.
It's just I'm in a new relationship, but we're trying to keep things simple.
Ah.
You know how it is.
Yeah.
Speaking of, are you sure it's a good idea for you and Chuck to be doing this thing for "W.
"? I normally pass on all publicity, but Blair asked me, so I couldn't say no.
I know how important she is to Chuck, and she knows how important I am to him, too, obviously.
So I'm glad there's no weirdness there.
Well, actually, there may be some weirdness.
Blair still has feelings for Chuck, so if she follows you around on Valentine's Day, she's gonna be hurt.
And if she finds out I ever told you this, I'll be hurt.
I hope my best friend would do the same for me.
Your secret's safe.
I do hate to cancel last minute, though.
Well, I'm sure she'll understand.
Besides, before "W.
" gave her this assignment, she wanted to spend Valentine's Day with me anyway, so Waldorf.
Where's the new Epperly? You're looking at her.
Oh, God, what'd you do to her? She's in a better place.
She's in Bali doing downward dogs with some British Wally named prat or prat named Wally.
In any case, she quit.
That's great.
My only contact at Conde Nast has been replaced by a stapler stealer.
And I will staple whatever's in your sweaty hand to your jeans if you don't leave this instant.
What's in my hand is an article.
Epperly said she'd get it to "Details.
" I'm assuming you can't do the same.
I-I did I did kinda get this job for you.
Only after you got me fired.
How many times must I repeat myself? We are not friends.
Just because we went to go see a movie Or five together does mean that I'll go out on a limb for you.
Okay, well, how about I just drop it in your in-box? As you can see, I don't have time to read faux-ticles by wannabe writers.
Blair, please.
I'll apply for another internship if I have to and get back in the ring with you.
Remember our little wrestling match? How about you apply yourself to a job more within your breeding? Isn't there a bat mitzvah girl somewhere in need of a Shirley temple? No, actually, I gave my cater-waiter contact to Ben.
He's doing Martha Stewart's Valentine's party.
Raina, hi.
I have those advanced questions like you asked for.
Should I fax them? I'm really sorry, Blair, but I'm not gonna be able to do the profile.
What? Why? I should have never agreed to do a social piece.
I just Think it's not a good idea.
Guess you'll have time to read my article now.
Chuck, hello.
Hey, I was just wondering Do you actually know why my father hates mine? I always assumed it was a business deal gone bad, but maybe there's more to it.
I don't think so.
My dad's too much of a gentleman to hold a grudge, and honestly, I don't even know how serious they were either of them.
I was at penn at the time.
Why? What did Lily say? Lily? Say about what? You don't know? She and my dad used to date.
She left him for your father.
Looks like this was one love letter Lily didn't want anyone else to read.
Hey, thanks for meeting me.
I'm surprised my dad and Lily let you out of the house, even for food.
Oh, well, it might have something to do with my volunteering or, uh, voluntary drug testing.
Look, the schnitzel's on me.
I'm sorry about lying last week.
Oh, thanks.
Have you heard from Damien? Uh, no, actually.
Uh, knowing the amBassador, after you told him Damien was dealing, I'm sure he was exiled to some very cold, very distant country.
You know who else I haven't heard from, though, is, uh, is Jonathan.
See, I I knew he probably didn't wanna talk to me again, but I-I thought he'd at least return my call and tell me so.
Well, leaving a message for someone isn't very romantic.
Have you thought about doing something big for him or show him how much you wanna see him? Like what? Like inviting him to Chuck's event.
Uh, I am not going to Chuck's event.
I have a hot date with a vehicle filled with hot meals.
I would feel sorry for myself except I am delivering food to people too sick to cook.
Oh, hey, at least it would be original.
So make the play, man.
Go out in a blaze of glory Or at least a double-parked panel van.
Ah, yeah, I really should take my own advice.
Why? Who do you wanna spend Valentine's Day with? Blair.
No, it's not no, no, no.
It's not like that.
It's, uh I I need her help with something.
You could be waiting a long time.
You're right, which is why I'm gonna find her at the party tonight.
May both our fortunes change for the better.
Can I interest you in some nucky? I snuck out of work early to catch up on "Boardwalk Empire.
" I need a primer on how to do business with Chicago.
Raina won't recommit.
I didn't realize the profile was that big of a deal.
She seemed so into it at first.
I need to find out why she backed out.
Well, if the profile isn't happening, we can do that friends Valentine's like I suggested.
Well, I'd hate to have nothing planned, but first, Ben is prison-poor.
Who is showering you with gifts on Valentine's Day? Just my mom.
She was glad that I came by.
Thank you for sending me.
I'm gonna go call the masseuse.
This won't take long, Russell.
I know you're a busy man.
Good.
I believe there's something standing in the way of Bass lndustries' survival something of a personal matter.
To what exactly are you referring? I know Lily broke your heart.
She broke my father's heart, too.
I wanna be clear.
My loyalty is with the Bass name only.
That's a lovely sentiment, but what does it mean? I'll do whatever it takes to stay in the company.
If Lily is an obstacle, I'll handle it.
Saying it is one thing, Chuck.
Following through is an entirely different matter.
The woman adopted you after your father died.
She's the only family you have.
Holmberg? Chuck Bass.
Gather the board.
It's been brought to my attention that Lily failed to disclose a significant conflict of interest with Thorpe Enterprises.
It needs to be handled immediately.
I'll explain when I'm back.
Yet again, I'm impressed.
Stay the course.
And I see no reason to believe that you and your legacy won't be well taken care of when the sale goes through.
Thank you, sir.
Hey.
Aren't you a little overdressed for hot stones? Donna called.
She needs me at work.
Oh, this is terrible.
The masseuse is already on her way.
I was really looking forward to spending time with you.
You have no idea how much.
S.
, cancel the masseuse and go to Chuck's.
No one should be alone tonight, and it would mean a lot to him to have you there, not because you're an "It" girl, but because he considers you family.
Well, I told Ben that I was staying in, but he's tutoring, so he won't mind.
Tutoring? Are you sure? Don't make fun.
He was so nervous, he didn't even wanna tell me.
I think it's noble.
No, of course you do, and you should.
Tutoring is great.
Now go put on your sexiest dress and treat yourself to a night out.
Thank you for saving me from a Valentine's Day even more depressing than the movie about it I was gonna watch.
Can we please have friend time after, though? I think it'll be too late for that.
I'm sorry.
"Love Actually" and the Jacques Torres fondue will have to wait.
I just got off the phone with Pete Holmberg.
There was an emergency meeting of the Bass board.
I'm being accused of an ethics violation and conflict of interest.
Well, stand up for yourself.
Don't let Thorpe get away with that.
It wasn't Thorpe.
It was Charles.
He had me removed from the board effective immediately.
What are you gonna do? I don't know what deal he cut with Thorpe, but it is not the way to win.
Yes, hello.
I'm calling on behalf of Chuck Bass.
His friend Dan Humphrey sent over a new employee today Ben Donovan.
Mr.
Bass wants to be sure that Ben is only working his event tonight and nowhere else.
Can you see to it? Thank you so much.
and it's filled to capacity.
This place is a gold mine.
I know how to tap a vein.
A few days ago, this was pillow talk.
Look at the ways you inspire me.
You're the one who pulled it off.
No one's gonna forget tonight.
Go get some b-roll of the food and drink, and be discreet.
We are not TMZ.
Humphrey, what are you doing here? Stalking you, actually.
You didn't, by chance, read my article? I don't need to.
I know what it's about a boy from Brooklyn and an untouchable Upper East Side blonde.
Well, uh, as a matter of fact I work at "W.
" now.
I'm an arbiter of taste.
If I were to stand behind some lame Humphrey lamentation, then it would be like showing up at an accessories shoot in crocs.
How do you know it's lame? You haven't read it.
Maybe Maybe I've matured as a writer, or maybe you've matured as a person and can help someone out who really needs it just because it's the right thing to do.
If you'll excuse me, I have a Valentine's vendetta to exact.
Where the hell is my crew? There she is.
Start rolling.
What the hell are you doing? I thought you were gonna be working all night.
I am.
"W.
" sent me here with a cameraman to get good stuff for the blog, and if I go back with only footage of Amanda Lepore and Ed Burns, then my 2-year plan might as well become 20.
Okay, fine, they can interview me, but please tell them to keep it brief.
Thank you, thank you, and it will be over before you know it.
Can we get some light over here, please? Lily.
Looking beautiful as always.
Oh, spare me the niceties, Russell.
I'm here to speak to Charles.
He's off with Raina somewhere.
You know, they're a wonderful couple, don't you think? What I think is that whatever it is you're up to appears to be working, and my son should know that.
Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, we need to have a little talk.
You realize you're the worst wingman ever.
Well, maybe so, but I hope you see I'm trying to be a good father.
I came here tonight to find Russell, say hello, and hand in my resignation.
Since I kept you from your trip to Venice, I thought I'd bring Venice to you.
How did you know? I saw your calendar.
Buona sera, arrigo.
Your favorites from Harry's bar.
I can't believe you did this for me.
When I care about someone, I'm not afraid to show it.
Hello, Daniel.
Have you seen Charles? And any resort plans this season? Uh, Mystique, maybe? I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.
Shoe of the moment.
Uh, Louboutin "Bianca.
" Are we almost done? Have you asked her who her Valentine is? We were instructed to ask everyone.
Uh, I'm not gonna answer that.
I'd like to keep my private life private.
But you do have a special someone Ben Donovan.
He's standing at the bar right now.
Or make that behind it.
Don't be embarrassed, S.
It's okay to below the line.
Madonna and Julia Roberts paved the way for girls like you.
So much for the quiet night at home.
And I thought you were tutoring.
I wasn't.
I just didn't know how to tell you.
Tell me what? You go, Serena.
Give that convict a chance to explain himself.
Before Ben was serving drinks, he served three years hard time.
In fact, he's been out on parole for what, a month? Ben, please, wait.
Okay, that's enough.
Let's go.
You know, I think that we've seen enough of each other tonight.
Lily, how dare you just barge in here.
This place is supposed to be my fantasy? All I wish for is the truth.
Why did you have me fired? You should've told me about your relationship with Russell.
If you were so concerned, why didn't you ask me about it? He has no bearing on my performance at Bass lndustries.
How can you be sure? Maybe your emotions clouded your judgment.
It wouldn't be the first time.
What? We both know you're a socialite, not a businesswoman.
You traded musicians for titans of industry, upgraded from a tour bus to a corporate jet.
I'm sorry, but I had to.
I've done nothing but try to salvage that company for you.
I stepped in so Jack wouldn't take it away, and every day since, I have fought for your future.
If we had stuck together on this, we would've won.
It looks like I did, anyway.
No, you haven't, Charles.
You've lost, and I'm not talking about your battle with Thorpe.
Please, that adoption was as much a business decision as this was.
Chuck.
That's enough.
Wait.
Where are you going? Anywhere but here.
You almost cost me my company.
You'd better not have cost me Raina.
Whatever price you pay for what you've done, that's on you.
I see you're a man of your word.
I said I'd get rid of Lily.
I did.
Too bad words are overrated.
What? Now that Lily's been ousted from the board, it's just you and me.
And as much I like you, I think I'll like dismantling Bass lndustries a lot more.
Now you have no company, no family, and from what I just saw, my daughter's lost her taste as well.
Great party, by the way.
You think Raina will keep you on that pedestal once she learns what you've done? Go find out.
I think you know how much family means to Raina, just as she now knows How little it means to you.
One lonely Bass adrift at sea.
Looks like Venice isn't the only thing that's sinking.
Blair.
I can't believe you ambushed me, and why? For a leg up at work? Is your career really more important than our friendship? Obviously you don't think my career is important at all since you forced Raina to back out just so you didn't have to be alone on Valentine's Day.
That's not why I did it.
I had a good reason.
You can't stand that I'm getting successful while you're flailing around with 15 hours of class and an ex-con.
That's not true.
I couldn't be more proud of your job at "W.
" I wanted to protect you from seeing Chuck and Raina together on Valentine's Day.
For the last time, he's using her.
It's not real.
It's just business.
How come no one believes me? Blair.
Look, you know what? I'm gonna go get him so he can tell you himself.
Russell.
Ah! Howard.
You're fired.
What? On what grounds? I mean, I was actually coming over here to quit anyway, but You leaked a private document.
Granted, that's exactly what I wanted you to do, but still.
I can't have someone around I don't trust.
Take care of yourself.
What just happened? Blair.
I'm looking for Chuck.
What is this place? Uh, he built it for Raina.
Oh.
He's pretty serious about this game.
Oh, I don't I don't I don't really think it's a game.
It's Raina, I just need five minutes.
Shh! I'm only here because I refuse to make this anyone else's business.
Look, I'm sorry you had to witness that scene with Lily.
I'm not the one you need to apologize to.
You went behind Lily's back.
You disrespected her.
Is this what you do wonderful things for people you care about before you turn on them? Look, you put family before all else.
I can't do that.
My father was never there for me.
My mother abandoned and betrayed me.
My Uncle is my worst enemy.
But maybe your father isn't as perfect as you think.
What are you saying? He's the reason I went after Lily.
He pitted me against her.
So you're trying to turn me against him? Destroy my relationship? Nothing is sacred to you.
That's not true.
You are sacred to me.
Until I do something you don't like and you turn on me, too.
Give me a chance to show you that's not who I am.
Please.
I'm sorry.
I've seen all I needed to see.
Rubies are red.
Hydrangeas are blue.
Chuck's given his heart away Wow, he's good.
But guess what, Blair? Not to you.
Shut up, Humphrey.
Well They're not Richart, but they're all I could find at this hour.
I was gonna leave them on your pillow.
Blair, please, it's been a long night.
I'm tired.
You were right.
Chuck and Raina are real.
Were real, anyway.
I know that chocolates from Duane Reade won't make it any better, but I'm so sorry.
Well, maybe I made the wrong decision in going to Raina first instead of you, but I was worried about your heart, not your job.
I knew that you'd bounce back stronger than ever at "W.
" You may be right.
Donna texted me.
She said your profile's gonna be amazing.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not thrilled you got an "a"-plus at Ben's expense.
After mentioning I'd stumbled across some incriminating Facebook photos, the interviewer wisely agreed to redact the Ben part of the article.
I'm sure he'd really appreciate that if he ever speaks to me again.
You're gonna be okay alone? Not yet, but I need to start learning to be.
Go have fun with your parolee.
Maybe it's a secret Valentine.
Hello? Why the hell would you do that? Well, this way, I can initiate a whole new round of pestering you to submit it.
But I already did yesterday.
I gave your article to a junior editor at "Vanity Fair," not "Details.
" I'm assuming that won't be a problem? Wait.
So you submitted it without reading? Of course I read it.
I have a reputation to uphold.
And you still put me through the wringer? It was good.
Mm, I'm sorry.
What'd you just say? You heard me.
It was sharp and well observed.
When it comes to experiencing an ex with a new love, you have some insight.
Mm.
How how are you doing with all that? Uh just seeking refuge with the perfect anti-Valentine's Day movie "Rosemary's Baby.
" What part are you at? I'll watch with you.
Forgive me if I've memorized some of Ruth Gordon's dialogue.
Uh, okay, all of it.
It just started.
Lesson learned.
"Wall Street" didn't need a sequel.
In the theater or in my life.
Now I just have to find something between manual labor and high finance.
Wish I'd been wrong about Thorpe.
Wish I had a company I could put you in.
Now one good thing I realized tonight I still got game.
As soon as Russell fired me, I had to turn over my key card.
So I gave him one To the gym at The Empire.
This Is to Thorpe's office.
And this All the passwords you need.
They change them weekly on Thursdays, so that should give you a good 48 hours.
Good luck.
Way to go.
A Valentine can be a red-hot weapon of revenge Or a heartfelt apology.
Thanks for comin'.
I should've told you I was waitering.
I should have owned it.
Well, I should've given you the chance and not put words in your mouth.
Hey.
It's still Valentine's Day for another ten minutes.
Maybe we can share 'em together? I made enough money tonight to buy us some beers.
Sounds great except for the beer part.
It's Valentine's Day.
We should have champagne.
Well, have you ever heard of a black velvet? That is champagne mixed with beer.
Uh, delicious or not.
Serena.
I just came over to thank you for saying all those nice things to us the other night My point is, paranoia can save your life.
Oh, so she was supposed to know that her husband was gonna sell their firstborn to a coven? The woman couldn't be more naive.
I mean, who eats unsolicited desserts? Mm, point taken.
The the mousse was creepy.
Do you know how many gloves I've lost on the subway? Well, you do often seem cursed.
I do, don't I? Or sometimes there's a way to candy-coat the fact you're all alone.
You know, I got more hugs tonight from strangers than my grandmother's doled out my entire life, which I guess is comforting, but it's not exactly Valentine's Day.
No, but you still might get one.
A guy came by earlier and asked for you.
Cute guy, brown hair.
Said you'd know who he was.
He's waiting around the corner.
Have fun.
Well, then I'll I'm gonna go Yeah.
And, uh Thank you, Eric.
Jonathan? Miss me? Okay, look, I want nothing to do with you, all right, Damien? You think I wanted Dan and Nate to rat me out to my own father? Now I'm under a microscope, and that is a big, big problem.
Yeah, that's an occupational hazard.
Listen to me.
You're not understanding what I'm saying.
It's also a problem for you.
Remember when you had all that stuff on your mind when we first started hanging out together What you told me about your mom and Ben? Well Perjury is a felony, and, well, Lily could be spending a lot of time in jail if, say, I were to tell everybody.
Here's what we're gonna do.
But whatever your Valentine's Day brings, never forget that some years, it's a massacre.
Gossip Girl here.
Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Perjury is a felony, and Lily could be spending a lot of time in jail if say, I were to tell everybody.
Lily and my date used to date, but that was a long time ago.
I'll do whatever it takes to stay in the company.
If Lily is an obstacle, I'll handle it.
Nothing is sacred to you.
That's not true.
You are sacred to me.
I've seen all I needed to see.
I suggested that you be promoted to replace me.
Congratulations.
Stefano's giving you a trial run starting now.
We are not friends.
Just because we went to go see a movie Or five together does not mean that I'll go out on a limb for you.
What about your family? What if us being together drives them all away? I don't think it will, but that's a risk I'm willing to take if you are.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.
O.
X.
O.
Gossip Girl.
Mick, Keith, and their questionably costumed cohorts said, "you can't always get what you want," but that doesn't mean it's okay for anyone else to have it either.
It's just toast.
But it's perfect.
It's the perfect amount of toasty.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry if we kept you up last night.
We were playing Scrabble.
She fell asleep to avoid losing.
Since when do you enjoy scrabble? Do you want some coffee? I made it.
Be careful.
She makes it strong.
She's giving staten Island Correctional a run for its money.
No, thanks.
I'm actually craving some Zibetto's.
You're gonna go all the way to midtown for coffee? Yeah, yeah, I have a meeting lunch up there anyway.
So see you guys later.
I should get going, too.
I agreed to so I could help plan Eric's 18th birthday party.
And I can't show up in yesterday's clothes.
Well, tell him I say congratulations and to be careful now that he's old enough to be tried as an adult.
Actually, I was hoping maybe you could come to the party and tell him yourself.
I'm not going to your mother's, Serena.
I'm not eating her food or drinking her wine or smiling and pretending that everything's okay.
I know.
I don't forgive her either.
I just We'll hang out when you're done.
I wished for chills on my birthday, but not thanks to the flu.
Well, looks like I'll be ushering in adulthood with warm tea and flat ginger ale.
Oh, we'll have to celebrate another time.
Oh, I need to get to this meeting.
Get some rest, okay? And I'll call everyone when I get home and cancel the party.
How's the patient? Do I need to change my breakfast with Thurston? No.
He's gonna be fine.
I wish I could say the same about this meeting.
Stay strong.
I know you'll do great.
Okay, I try not to meddle in Dorota's duties, but don't you think you're taking it a bit too far? Marie Antoinette, Scarlett O'Hara I merely following the footsteps or other powerful women who did not have time to zip.
Or maybe you're just delusional from lack of sleep.
Your light hasn't been off for nights.
Great leaders only need three hours.
Mine just happen to be nonconsecutive.
It's all part of my 2-year plan.
Every minute is allotted for work, school, and personal obligations.
Ow! That was my skin.
Studies stay not enough sleep make people psychotic.
Shouldn't you be brushing? Are you sure your workaholism has nothing to do with Raina and Chuck and Valentine's day? They broke up, and I only have 30 seconds left of "being a good friend" time, so spill.
Where were you last night? At the loft, just sleeping.
It's hard to find the time with Dan always there and you here, and you know, there's been a lot of buildup.
A 3-year stint in the big house I'd say so.
Obviously, "good friend time" has expired.
B.
, please, at least consider a nap.
What are you doing? Less reading, more grooming.
I'm the only one who can multitask.
Girls Inc.
Has found its new face in Raina Thorpe, if only Chuck Bass could get her to look at his again.
But New York's favorite bad boy always gets what he wants, and in this case, we think that's the girl who has everything.
I'm sure miss Raina does not have personal dresser.
Yes, but she has a company and a foundation and maybe a second chance with Chuck.
Keep up, Dorota.
The time has come for the dictator to delegate.
I'm moving up my time line.
Russell manipulated me to make me look like a monster with Lily so Raina would break up with me and I'd lose my one advocate within his company.
So you said more than a couple of times.
I have to get her back.
I need you to bump into her while she's meeting your mother about Girls Inc.
, then just distract her for a while.
I'm pretty sure a businesswoman like Raina has plans for the day, and what do I talk to her about anyway? Me.
I have faith in you, Nathaniel.
Your Archibald charm can get me the opening I need.
Just change the sweater.
What's wrong with my sweater? You called us here to Skype? No, I called you into "W.
" but apparently someone thought that stood for "Waldorf.
" It's fine.
No time to waste on blame.
Oh, thank God.
One does not get promoted without working 50-hour weeks, nor does one graduate early without doubling their course load.
There are philanthropic positions to secure as well as relations to nurture.
Yet with science so woefully behind in cloning technology, i can only be in one place at a time.
Dorota? Jessica, art history essay exam.
We got the question in advance.
You will just sit in front of the proctor and take my dictation over bluetooth.
Penmanship counts.
Now, Penelope, gifts for Eric's birthday and my mother's new home in Aix.
And please do try to approach my level of taste.
New minion? My name is Emily.
She has no time to care.
The opera is naming their new board, and I need to be on it, which means that I need to meet with Bryn Harold today.
I don't want to do gifts.
I'm sorry, but the time allotted for this attraction is now up.
Interns, step in.
Now since the new online blog is molding minds, I'll do that myself.
You will sort portfolios, draft editorial captions, and research back Are you talking to me? Of course not.
Where are my interns? They put in for transfers.
Your management style was a little aggressive.
One claims she has P.
T.
S.
D.
And threatened a lawsuit.
Oh.
Good luck.
The last assistant who lost her interns lost her job, too.
Not to worry.
My new intern is already here.
Thanks for coming.
I've requested a quiet table over there Oh, I'm not staying.
I only came to tell you to stop calling me.
Lily, I know I said some terrible things, but let me explain.
I've tolerated a lot from you over the years, but nothing could justify the humiliation that you put me through on Valentine's Day.
Russell Thorpe is setting me up.
I don't care Russell was doing behind the scenes.
It's no excuse for the things that you said to me.
I can't believe you're on his side.
This guy's trying to destroy our company.
Your company.
You had me fired.
I'm done trying to protect the Bass legacy.
Russell will make a marvelous owner.
What is it with this guy? You still have feelings for him? Please.
I'm a married woman.
That didn't stop you from cheating on my father.
I'm sure you'll do the same to Rufus.
Good-bye, Charles.
Hey.
I thought, since I no longer have a party to plan, I figured I could just come make sure Eric was okay, wish him happy birthday, and then we could spend the rest of the day doing whatever.
I heard "A Free Man Of Color" is great.
Matinee would get us out of the cold.
Or my room at the Waldorfs' is pretty cozy.
Maybe you don't even have to go up to see Eric.
Oh, it'll just be a minute, I promise.
I mean, he's right there.
Don't even try to tell me you're on an emergency ibuprofen run.
I'm not sick.
The slap was a nice touch Oscar-worthy.
Yes, well, it was surprisingly satisfying.
Lily, once again, I'm sorry.
I feel like a fool for ever believing Russell over you.
Well, let's just hope it's not long before he's the one feeling foolish.
Can't get no satisfaction.
Looks like that's up for debate.
I know that they were just trying to help, but Dan and Nate actually made things worse when they went to see Damien's father.
How, exactly? Damien's got his big coke shipment coming in today from Europe.
It's arriving at the flower market in the fertilizer packs of a hundred pink tulips.
And since his dad has people watching his every move, he's making me be his drug mule.
What? Why would you do that? What does he have on you? On me, nothing.
But he knows that mom forged the affidavit about Ben.
You told him? Eric, you know what would happen if that ever comes out.
Mom could go to prison.
I'm aware.
I stupidly thought that Damien was my friend, and I knew he would never wanna clear your name.
You can't blame yourself.
But you can't do this drug deal.
How else am I supposed to stop him from outing my mom? I did this.
I gotta fix it.
Great birthday, right? Go upstairs and tell mom that you're feeling better and not to cancel your party.
We'll take care of this, I promise.
Thank you.
If we go to the police, Damien will just tell them about my mom.
I-I should just get the flowers myself.
Serena, it's a drug deal.
Anyone who touches those flowers can get arrested.
Yeah, and if no one does, my mom will.
You can't risk anyone else's future to protect hers.
The right thing to do here is nothing.
Then the worst that happens is Lily pays for what she did.
At least no one else will.
Ben, she's my mother.
Who created this whole situation on her own.
I think we should take a rain check on our afternoon.
Yeah.
Call me later? This job offer won't last forever.
No way am I gonna work for you.
I came here to see if you wanted to have lunch, not sign up for indentured servitude.
Penelope, I see on "Gossip Girl" that you're between is a tasteful gift-free zone.
Get back in the cab.
What do you mean you don't know the price of the Prada clutch? You are Prada.
Let me speak to Miuccia.
Tell me.
For someone who is so determined to remain a free person, why are you still here? Listen, I'm not gonna work for you, but as a friend, I am willing to help out.
All you have to do is admit you need me.
What? Never.
The last person I need is Dan Humphrey, who shouldn't flatter himself by thinking he's my friend.
Yes, I need immediate delivery of four venti lattes with extra shots.
None of which are for you.
Oh, good, I don't really like refreshments with my theater.
Hey, Raina.
Nate.
I just finished having tea with your mom.
I would have stayed longer, but I have to meet Ivanka at Trump Place.
You haven't seen my driver, have you? You know what? The police probably got him for double parking.
It happens all the time on this block.
I guess I should just catch a cab.
Yeah, if you have an hour.
Cab to Riverside will take at least that long right now.
How is that possible? It's 15 blocks.
The best way to get anywhere right now is through the park.
You mean walk.
I'll escort you.
That way, you won't wander off into sheep's meadow.
Come on.
Trust me.
It'll be fast, and it's fun.
Okay, then.
Escort away.
There aren't really sheep there, right? No.
Just a lot of grass.
The kids theme is perfect for the party.
Eric has always been so serious and grown-up.
This will be his last grasp at childhood.
Thank you.
Nate's distracting Raina.
Now we have to get Russell out of the office, get access to his computer before they change the password The Captain gave me.
Well, Russell isn't liquid enough to acquire something as big as Bass Industries on his own, so he must have a backer, and if it's true that it's more profitable to keep Bass Industries intact, then I'm sure that this investor would appreciate if we told him this.
Let's hope we can find him before he writes Thorpe a check.
I don't know how much longer we can wait for Russell to call.
You could make the first move, play the modern woman.
Look, you of all people know that men like Russell need the pursuit.
Maybe I simply just don't have the allure that I used to.
No.
The way he's playing this, behind all the false claims, there's a real agenda, and it's personal.
I have to think it's his feelings for you.
Russell, what a surprise.
No, it's a pleasant one, actually.
Well, yes, after everything that's happened with Charles, I was hoping you would call.
Oh, I'd love to meet you for a drink.
No, the Oak Bar is perfect.
See you soon.
Do you have Bryn Harold? Well, then take off your shoes and chase her down, because I need that opera.
As a front-of-book idea.
They're doing "Boris Godunov" this spring.
Who doesn't love tsars and cossacks? Seems like a better concept for fall, but I'll run it by the group.
You sure you're not ready to admit you need my help? Never! No, "never" isn't what he transitioned Spain into.
It's modernism, and don't get caught talking during a test.
When was the last time you slept? Sleep is for the weak, and speaking of which, don't act like I don't know why you're really here.
It's because you're avoiding Ben and Serena at the loft.
No, I'm waiting for you to crack.
Stefano said to research the opera.
And what's the ETA.
On today's blog post? Uh uh within the hour.
Blair, if you take on one more thing, you're gonna break.
Blair, we need your help with a scheme.
She can't.
Oh.
I can.
New paragraph.
The nude Maja' began Goya's separation from religious iconography.
" What are you doing here? I'm leaving.
This just went from "Women On The Verge" to "Saw II", I don't like Gore p0rn really.
Are you sure you can help us? You seem pretty busy.
A takedown only takes two minutes.
Stefano Tonchi's office.
Please hold.
Yes.
You hold, too, Jessica.
Tell me the plot points.
Look at everyone Skating and kissing and Doing karate.
Oh, it's It's Tai Chi.
I mean, don't they have parks in Chicago? Mm-hmm, Grant Park.
It's beautiful.
I think I saw a picture of myself there At the age of 3.
But it may have been The White House lawn.
Guess that's what happens when your mother walks out before you can walk.
I'm sorry.
I, uh, I had no idea.
My mom used to take me skating here every winter.
I've never been.
What? You're from the home of The Hawks, and you haven't been skating? I watch from our box, not from the ice.
Oh.
Oh, come on.
I'll teach you.
What about my meeting? Trust me.
Your first time in skates is worth being a few minutes late, okay? Look, go take a look.
I'll get the skates and be right there.
All right, 7 1/2 Penelope, I'm putting someone else on gifts.
Return immediately for your new and urgent flower mission.
All the details are on a purple sticky note on my computer.
It's about time.
You texted me, like, two minutes ago.
I was downstairs getting a sandwich.
Now what's so urgent? I wanted to tell you that You were right About that thing.
Oh, now which thing was that? I, Blair Waldorf, need Dan Humphrey's help.
As a friend and peer, not as an underling.
As my friend and peer, not my underling.
As my friend and peer, not an underling.
Culinary crisis in features.
Ted's got a lead on rare white truffles in Tuscany.
We need you.
Okay, so all right, what do you want me to do? It's all on my desk.
Just start.
Painting it black has nothing on the trouble one piece of purple paper can cause.
Hey, sorry again about, uh, spilling the cider.
Ice skating was worth it, plus I got to cancel my day and continue my adventure of things I've never done, like nothing at 2:00 in the afternoon.
What would you be doing if I wasn't here? Probably just studying.
What subjects? Well, I might be playing a little "Black Ops" first, yeah.
Would you be doing this, too? It does make me a better soldier.
Another thing I've never tried.
Seriously? That wasn't peer pressure, by the way.
I just Will you light me up? You know who gets really, really good weed? Chuck.
This really is a day of firsts.
To old friends and new beginnings.
Nothing would make me happier.
I hope you know I never meant for you to become collateral damage in this acquisition.
Oh, of course.
I remember how important it was for you to keep your personal life and business separate.
You always understood me.
Okay, have a good weekend.
You know, I still have a soft spot for that bar at the Peninsula Hotel.
We did have some memorable moments.
I don't want to cross any lines that you don't want to cross, Lily.
I'm only happy if we can move forward, even if it's just as friends.
Oh, maybe we could just get one more glass of wine.
I never really knew how you felt about me choosing Bart If I was important to you or just amusing.
You and Rufus seem to have a good thing going.
Yes, well, that is just a show.
After we lost the first Bass Industries buyer, I couldn't risk the rumors of more family trouble.
Look at what the Dodgers are going through with the Mccourts.
Exactly, but luckily the situation will be over once your bid goes through.
Right now I'm just grateful that Rufus doesn't come home very often.
Maybe husband number six will be the charm.
Oh, I can't believe what time it is.
I have to get home to Eric's 18th birthday party.
Thank you for such a lovely afternoon.
I hope it's not our last.
Me, too.
Please note which ones are the cossacks and which ones will play the tsars.
Thank you.
Bryn Harold is friends with Lily Humphrey.
She'll be at Eric's party tonight, I have all the information.
Well done, new minion.
Make sure my resume is up to date.
She doesn't take applications, Blair.
She just invites people who impress her And aren't still in college.
Well, as you can probably tell, I'm not a typical college student.
I'm a self-actualized, mature-beyond-her-years-yet- still-youthful-and-dewy working woman.
Bryn Harold will be impressed.
Those aren't tulips.
Why would I buy your mother and Eric tulips? I left you a message.
I didn't get it.
I took you off of gift duty and put you on purple sticky note.
What purple sticky note? The one that I said I left on my computer screen.
It was right here.
Oh.
Hey, is everything okay? You have a visitor, says her name is Vanessa.
Tell him I came to apologize, and I'm happy to wait here till he gets back.
She says that I heard, I heard.
Tell her that I got all of her texts and her handwritten letters, and I will be in touch when I'm ready.
He says do I really have to say that? Shouldn't you just talk to her yourself? No, no, no, no, no.
Giving her the message myself will defeat the entire purpose of the message, and I'm really busy right now.
I'm on the Upper East Side delivering, like, a hundred tulips.
A hundred tulips.
Got it.
Hey, is anyone waiting for a tulip delivery? Why on earth did you get them? Uh, to help Blair.
These are purple.
Oh, and plant-y.
Why are you guys so interested in tulips? Well, at least no one will get arrested.
Except mom when Damien finds out we don't have his coke.
Okay, all right, will somebody tell me what the hell's going on? Poor E.
, only 18, and already welcoming all the makings of anyone's 19th nervous breakdown.
Blair, what were you thinking? That I would arrive at this party and be greeted appropriately.
I know you only admitted you needed me so you could make me your drug mule.
That sticky note was meant for Penelope.
Frankly, with her attitude, she could use some time behind bars.
So that's it? There's no "I'm sorry I could have gotten you arrested"? Well, you're here.
The party's lovely.
Everything obviously turned out fine.
Except that you sent Dan to get the wrong flowers.
The tulips with the coke were pink.
And I wrote that down.
This one's on you, Humphrey.
You wrote purple.
Classic stroop effect.
Where you write or say a color that you see instead of the one you mean.
You're not the only one who knows his neurodysfunction.
Happy Birthday.
Yeah, right.
Damien just called.
Turns out he pre-sold the coke and is therefore on his way to pick up the $100,000 he says I now owe him.
That's insane.
Nobody has that kind of money, do they? Not on them, but we need it now, or he's gonna out mom here tonight.
It's your 18th birthday, which means the checkbook to your Rhodes Trust Fund is somewhere in that pile of presents.
Okay.
All right.
Let's get unwrapping.
I know you're thinking that stroop is one of the symptoms of chronic fatigue, but I'm not even tired.
So it turns out Russell's financial backer is a guy named Bradley Kidd from Atlanta.
He owns a lot of property down South, nothing marquee.
Bass would be a huge move for him, and something he's capable of making.
How do we convince him not to? Because The Captain was right.
Thorpe ran a bunch of financial scenarios for Kidd, but nothing involved keeping Bass Industries intact.
Would Kidd consider backing us instead? That's why I invited him tonight, to convince him it's a better business move or to get him to break his deal with Russell.
Good spying.
Thank you.
I kind of like this double agent thing you have going on.
You do? Mm-hmm.
You gotta move in order to be better.
I'm trying.
Arm twist.
There you go.
Okay, finally.
Finally, a sport I can beat you in.
Oh, come on.
No.
First of all, this isn't even a sport.
Second of all, gloat all you want to.
Just please don't tell anybody I danced to "Tik Tok.
" I wouldn't call that dancing.
What? Hey, hey, at least I'm a good loser, okay? You threw your racket so hard, you almost broke the tv when I beat you at the tennis game.
This will make up for it.
Mmm.
That's awesome.
Mm-hmm.
We need to call Ben & Jerry.
No, we should start our own company.
Yes.
Hmm.
That was my dream when I was 5.
Don't tell my dad.
Mm, I won't.
This is really fun.
Hey.
Where have you been? I need you to bring Raina to Eric's party.
Sorry, man.
The music was really loud.
Music? Never mind.
Change of plan.
Keep her there until I call back.
Bye.
You know who loves ice cream? Chuck he loves it.
Nate I know what you've been trying to do all day.
You do? Mm-hmm.
Ugh! I hate professional gift wrapping.
What are you doing? Do you realize how gauche it is to open gifts at a party, before dessert? I was just so excited to have a new addition to my stock portfolio.
Well, at least make a list for thank-you notes.
I'm on hold with Victor from the flower market.
You've already done enough by getting me this, uh, salad bowl.
It's baccarat, and it's for my mother, which means that your Larry Clark print is on its way to her.
Penelope.
Keep going.
I'll be right back.
Yeah.
Great party.
Happy Birthday.
I'm guessing you're not here to celebrate.
I just saw Damien go up, and I know you sent Dan to get the drugs.
The Dan part was a mistake, but I did ask Blair to help.
I thought that you agreed that no one else should get hurt to protect your mother.
I'm not okay with what she did either, but it doesn't mean that I wanna destroy her.
Are you saying you choose Lily? You chose for me by turning to ice every time I mention her name.
I'm sorry.
I have to go help my brother now.
Bryn, I am so glad you could come.
Rufus and I are really enjoying the season so far.
Thanks.
You'll excuse me.
Mrs.
Harold, hi.
Oh, yes.
I'm Blair Waldorf.
Hi.
What a pleasure to meet you.
Russell, what a surprise.
Uh What are you doing here? Well, I figured he only turns 18 once.
Well, I don't think it's a good idea for you to stay.
Rufus decided to make an appearance.
I promise I won't draw attention.
I'm just a business associate, an old family friend stopping by with a gift.
Well, I suppose I can't argue with that.
You do look exceptionally lovely.
Lily, what the hell is going on? Nice to see you again, Rufus.
You think I'm a fool? I know what went on between you two, and looks like it's still going.
Please, this is not the time.
You're the one who invited him to Eric's 18th birthday party.
Actually, I was just leaving.
No, you know, some men know how to behave appropriately at social events.
Ahem.
Russell, I'm so sorry.
I'll call you later.
You know, you're not so bad at that double agent thing yourself.
Think he bought it? With my "W.
" blog, I'm imprinting proper etiquette and fashion sense as well as my philanthropic mandate on a whole new generation much like you did.
You do realize you're wearing two different shoes? By the way, um, have you seen Chuck Bass? I heard he's dating Raina Thorpe, and I'd love an introduction.
No, I haven't seen either of them.
Brad, what are you doing here? Russell, didn't expect to see you.
Looking for me.
Mr.
Kidd.
Chuck Bass.
Thanks for coming.
I think I'll stay, too.
Uh, that's Dalgaard Two "a's" after the "g.
" Why are you doing this? Angry cokeheads My father cut me off.
I have to pay them back somehow.
Make sure you don't leave out any of those zeroes.
Fine, but then that's the end of it.
$100,000? Eric, what is the meaning of this? I hear a storm is threatening someone's very life today.
Let's hope they find some shelter and it's not behind bars.
 $100,000 worth of drugs? You promised you were done with all of this.
Mom, it's it's not what it looks like.
Seems like you Van Der Woodsen/Humphreys have a lot of discussing to do, so I'm gonna go get a cocktail, maybe some Mac and Cheese.
You know your options.
Let me guess.
You and Lily are all made up, and she and Rufus are quite happily married.
I don't meddle in my stepmother's affairs, or in your case, a lack thereof.
Chuck here is just trying to manipulate you to pull your backing.
The only manipulation is yours.
You don't want anyone to know it doesn't make financial sense to rip Bass Industries apart.
You're just upset because you lost your daddy's company.
We understand.
It's very sad.
But it's time to get over it.
Brad, I'm sorry he dragged you into this.
Let me buy you a real dinner.
I think I'll stay and hear young Mr.
Bass out.
The only thing I hate more than being lied to is being cheated.
You're making a mistake.
What are you doing here? This is Serena's brother's birthday party.
It's not okay for you to just show up here.
All I wanna do is apologize for the part I played in what happened to her.
I had no idea that was Juliet's plan, and you know me, Dan.
I would never be okay with things going that far.
Yeah, that's what my sister said before she did the right thing and came clean.
You, on the other hand, pointed a finger at her and left town.
Wow.
I guess I can never come back, not even with you.
I'm not gonna chase after you, Vanessa.
And I wouldn't stop for you if you did.
Juliet's right, what she said.
I'm an outsider around here and always will be.
I'm relieved you're not going to overdose, but you should have come to me with this.
I just I-I didn't wanna worry you.
I wanted to fix my mistake.
The only mistake was mine When I forged Serena's signature.
Wow.
That's the first time you've admitted it was wrong.
Well, it seemed right at the time, but I know it wasn't.
And as much I appreciate you both trying to protect me, I can't allow anyone else to pay for what I did.
Hey.
Can't a person have some privacy to make a phone call? Where's your phone? Look, Blair, I just wanted to tell you that you were right.
I was only hanging out at "W.
" to avoid being at the loft with Ben and Serena.
That's your big revelation? I think you've actually gotten less smart since high school, Humphrey.
Oh, right.
You go to N.
Y.
U.
Well, I'm smart enough to see that your race to greatness has, uh, come down to a competition with Raina.
That's ridiculous.
She's from the midwest.
You're the one wearing two different shoes.
Because of Dorota.
My problem isn't emotional.
It's administrative.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have delegation disasters to fix.
Penelope sent me for the bowl, and Jessica said to tell you you got an "F" on your essay.
I guess she showed up at Professor Trudeau's class and Trudeau teaches history, not art history.
Yeah.
She figured that out after.
I really loved your blog, though.
The blog? What? I-I completely forgot.
Well, all that stuff about servants being like belts and purses and overpriced and interchangeable It was really funny Or mean.
Wait.
Was there something about admitting you need help from friends? "Friends are the fashion fundamentals.
" See? You did write it.
Well, of course.
Who else could turn minions into a metaphor? Bye.
Well, well, well, if it's not my favorite ex-con to run into in dark alleys.
If you ever use that information about Lily, I'll have you killed.
It's a tad melodramatic, don't you think? Well, that's up for you to decide while you're walking around, wondering if that guy behind you is the ex-con I got to do the job.
Those guys I had beat up Howard Archibald only stopped after ten minutes because I told them to.
It takes a hell of a lot less time to kill a man.
I always knew you read too much Shakespeare to be sane.
Bygones.
Turns out what Ben did while doing time wasn't on his side.
Now Vanessa has him under her thumb.
I appreciate you looking this over so quickly.
I'll be in touch either way.
You still with Raina? I'm ready for you to bring her over.
Dude, it's not happening.
What do you mean? I'm sorry.
She figured out what I was up to, and she split.
All right, I mean, you should just move on.
You can get any girl in New York, not to mention Europe, Australia, and several parts of Asia.
I appreciate your efforts, Nathaniel.
No worries, man.
You sure you don't wanna give him one more chance? I told you I've dated guys like Chuck my whole life.
I think I'm done with business in bed and portfolio pillow talk.
I want my day of firsts with you.
Then what else have you never done? Well, Happy Birthday.
Fork, please.
No Raina? Not tonight.
At least I got to see the look on Russell's face when you accused him of sleeping with Lily.
I know.
Rufus did play the jealous husband brilliantly.
Mm, so sad I missed all of this.
And did anyone else see Vanessa, or am I having ether flashbacks? It's probably the latter, although I did notice Blair wearing two different shoes.
Hmm.
And Ben.
He came, but then he turned right around and left.
Are you so sure about that? Sorry to interrupt.
Damien won't be bothering you anymore.
I made it clear that I wouldn't cooperate.
Thank you, Benjamin.
I can't believe you did that for her.
I didn't.
I did it for you.
I don't want anything to stand in the way of us moving forward.
Me either.
Maybe we should stay and eat some cake.
Not yet.
Forgiveness isn't gonna happen overnight, Serena.
I know.
What matters is that you made the first step.
Your "friends as fashion" metaphor Was well executed but did not save my job.
You got fired? Slash quit.
Donna said they'd been watching me for a while, hoping for the best, but let's face it.
I'm imploding.
At least you got your name in the blog.
I'm sorry, Blair.
I thought that if I could be the Blair Waldorf that I want to be a little sooner, that maybe I could return to Chuck before he fell for someone else.
Well, you do know Raina broke up with him.
Yes, in my head, but in my heart I feel further away than ever.
I mean, tonight he's thinking about a different girl, and meanwhile, I lost my job, I failed a test, I almost got my best friend's mother arrested.
And I'm in Brooklyn talking about it to Dan Humphrey.
Uh, well, I'm about to order some pizza If you wanna stay.
I think someone "Freaky Friday'ed" me, and this can't possibly be my life.
Well, it is.
What do you want? Gourmet, I suppose.
Burning the midnight oil, trying to put the Bass Industries deal back together? I'm sorry.
Have we met? Damien Dalgaard, fellow victim of the Bass/Van Der Woodsen Humphrey clan.
If you have $100,000 and promise to keep a secret, I have a little information you might find useful.
When you do finally get what you want, the problem is there's always someone who's trying to take it away.
Blair's light's off.
I noticed.
And all that wanting makes us blind to the fact that things aren't exactly what we think they are.
You're the worst kind there is an intellectual snob.
Maybe it's better sometimes to just get what you need.
X.
O.
X.
O.
Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
What in the hell were you trying to do? Get Ben out of prison, mom.
What, by putting me in? The information about Ben in the affidavit can never get out, ever.
If you ever use that information about Lily, I'll have you killed.
I figured we could spend the rest of the day doing whatever.
Tonight he's thinking about a different girl, and meanwhile, I lost my job, I failed a test, and I'm in Brooklyn talking about it to Dan Humphrey.
I overheard this guy talking about you to an employee.
He said that you were responsible for a fire in one of your own buildings.
I've had that man's death on my conscience for 20 years.
Someone died? You're just upset because you lost your daddy's company.
Brad, I'm sorry he dragged you into this.
Let me buy you a real dinner.
I think I'll stay and hear young Mr.
Bass out.
We'll get through this.
You sound so sure, I almost believe you.
They're ready for us.
I'll be waiting.
Hmm? Lily, this is Assistant District Attorney Vinson.
He's going to be taking your statement.
Whenever you're ready, Mrs.
Humphrey.
They say Rome wasn't built in a day, and yet what a difference a day makes.
I hear that shoe strings tend to break  But they tie back together great  I feel I know  I know where you're coming from  Notebooks filled with lines  Hey.
You coming down? I think I know  I know where you're coming from  Mm, hot tea, Dorota Decaf, and one of my leafy green juices.
Thank you.
B.
, you okay? You seem different.
Hmm? I'm doing a cleanse.
No, I mean Oh.
I'm fine.
Being fired/quitting "W" was humiliating, but it was also a wake-up call.
If Chuck and I are meant to be together, then I should trust that, and in the meantime, I want whatever's best for both of us.
Wow, that's very enlightened.
It's the leafy greens.
B vitamins are excellent for cognitive function.
Good, because I need your help.
Ben hasn't been returning any of my texts since we Spent the night together, and it was amazing, but it can't be a coincidence that he's suddenly avoiding me.
Well, did you tell him you thought it was amazing? Well, I think I made it pretty clear.
He is a guy.
You should march over there and make sure he knows.
And take a juice with you for the road.
Thank you.
B.
, you really do seem good.
You're doing it again.
Something is different about you.
I have a sixth sense.
You have no sense.
You don't come to me with any complaints about anything.
You're too happy Content.
I'm worried you join cult.
I have found my center, that's all.
But just to reassure you, here's a complaint.
Why haven't you picked up my cocktail dress for Chuck's party yet? Charles Bass to see you? Send him in.
Let me guess.
You were in the neighborhood, and you thought you'd stop by and gloat.
Oh, no.
I came to see Raina.
I guess she's not in yet.
I wanted to invite her to a party I'm having at the Empire tonight.
My deal with Kidd closes tomorrow.
You're welcome to attend as well.
Sorry.
I didn't come to gloat.
I've just always been a multitasker.
Don't you worry.
A victory lap might be premature.
Why would I? Thanks for my invitation, Chuck.
And as for my daughter's schedule, you might want to check with your buddy Nate Archibald.
They've been spending a lot of time together these last few days.
I see that's something else you aren't aware of.
Meaning? Your deal closes tomorrow, but you tell Lily I'll see you both tonight.
So I thought maybe we'd catch a matinee at the Ziegfeld before heading over to Blondies to watch Villanova whup ass on Notre Dame.
Sounds great, but Have you told Chuck about us yet? We're an "us"? I like you.
But I don't wanna come between you and your best friend, even if that best friend is Chuck Bass.
But We haven't done anything yet, so you're free to pull the chute and walk away if that's what you want.
That's not what I want, so I'll talk to Chuck today.
In the spirit of full disclosure, there's something you need to know about me.
My dad and I We're Notre Dame fans.
Oh, no.
No, you can't be.
What are you talking about? Uh-huh.
Guesskids are out of the question.
I can't believe I let you talk me into the Joseph Beuys exhibit after all.
There was a great article in here on him.
You should read it.
We should go over field trip procedures again.
Oh, joy.
Okay, I arrive first, survey the location in case there's anyone I know and scout out an exit strategy.
You arrive at least 15 minutes later.
Plausible deniability.
We just ran into each other.
You're really big on plausible deniability.
Has anybody ever told you that? Do you wanna explain to someone why we went somewhere together? Ms.
Blair? Uh go through my bathroom into Serena's room.
Come on.
Is this really necessary? Move it! Dorota.
You scared me.
What are you doing back so soon? Oh, I forgot claim ticket.
Who were you talking to? No one.
Maybe your sixth sense is picking up voices from the other side.
You know what? I could use some fresh air.
I will go with you to get the dress.
Let's go.
Now.
"Daniel Humphrey.
" Daniel Humphrey! Let's go! Chop-chop! Hey.
What are you doing here? I know I probably should have called first, but you haven't returned any of my earlier calls, so I figured I'd just swallow my pride and stop by.
Now would be a good time to give my pride a boost and invite me in.
Uh now actually isn't a good time.
Ben? What's she doing here? Uh Serena, this is my mother, Cynthia.
Mrs.
Sharp, I, um, I'm Serena.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I wish I could say the same.
Ben? Remember I told you Serena's friends with my roommate Dan.
I'm sorry.
He's not here right now, but I'll I'll let him know that you stopped by.
So you didn't tell her about us? No.
Why not? Sorry, S.
Looks like your sweetheart's mom is still a little sour.
Oh, thank you, Vanya.
I just need to make sure that my Elie Saab dress is in there for the party tonight.
Here you are, ma'am.
Thank you.
But when it comes to life's bitter pills Is everything okay? Yes, Vanya, thank you.
The hardest to swallow is a taste of your own medicine.
I-I'm sorry.
I-I should've given you a heads up.
She got here a few days ago.
That's why I haven't been able to return your calls.
And here I thought I was being paranoid.
Look, it's hard enough trying to explain to her why I haven't tried to clear my name.
If I if I tell her that we're dating, she's gonna think I'm doing all this for you.
Her issue is with my mother, not me.
You were able to win over my family and my friends.
I just want the same chance.
Hey, how about we have lunch today, just the three of us at my place? I'll talk to her.
Someone who knows about Ben is trying to send a message.
Subtle.
It's Russell, I'm assuming.
We spoke this morning.
He told me our victory party was premature.
Well, if he knows, he'll use it to kill the deal, threaten to go public unless He's fishing.
If he had proof, he would've made that play by now.
We need to shut down his lead, whoever it is.
What about Ben? You don't think Russell could have gotten to him? Well, I don't think so.
We seem to have resolved our issues, and I'd make sure if I were you.
In the meantime, I'll try and find out what Russell's planning.
Charles, I'm so sorry.
Hey.
Talk to Ben.
So why did you wanna grab coffee with your old man? Do I need a reason? No, but you have one.
I, uh, I need your advice, but I gotta keep the details vague.
Oh, please, the vaguer, the better.
Keeps parenting a challenge.
You ever hung out with someone but not been able to tell anyone? You mean, hang out, hang out, or, you know, hang out, hang out? Oh, God, this was a bad idea.
What? That was vague.
Well, for what it's worth, when Lily and I started hanging out again, neither of us wanted anyone else to know.
But friendship can be an excuse, a cover when there's something more you don't want to admit or you're too scared to explore.
No, no, no.
I mean, there's no way.
That I mean, even the thought of that is Scary.
No, I mean, we're not even friends, I swear.
We're not.
Listen, why don't we, uh, why don't we just turn this coffee into a lunch? Oh, I thought you said you only had an hour before you had to be somewhere.
I did, not now I don't.
Would you pick up the pace? Sorry, I don't want to make you late to What exhibit is it again? Joseph Beuys.
Why? Maybe I could go with you.
You don't even know who he is.
He created the term "social sculpture" to illustrate idea of art's potential to transform society.
How do you know that? From Mr.
Humphrey's "New York" magazine I found in your room.
Just what are you implying? Your new secrecy, calmness with Mr.
Chuck, supporting Ms.
Serena's new boyfriend, and last week, I find "NOVA" documentary in your Netflix queue! What are you doing in my queue? You and Lonely Boy are having affair! We are not! We have gone to a few things together.
It started over the holidays.
It's no big deal.
No big deal? We have to tell Ms.
Serena.
We will do no such thing.
I am not friends with Dan Humphrey.
And to prove it, I will happily skip the Beuys exhibit and leave him hanging.
I would rather shop anyhow.
So come on.
Let's go.
First stop, Chlo? Well, thank you for the tour, Serena.
Good thing you're serving lunch.
I'm hungry after all that walking.
Mom.
I'm just trying to joke.
I'm nervous.
I'm not used to being in a place like this.
So I thought I would keep things simple for lunch.
Most people's favorite pizza in Manhattan is John's, but I've always been partial to Joe's.
I'm, uh, lactose-intolerant.
Oh, my gosh.
I'm I'm so sorry.
Salad it is, then? Here you go.
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
This is, um About school, and I forgot the iced tea, so I'll be right back.
Hey, mom, can we talk later? This will only take a minute.
Why are you whispering? Ben and I are having lunch with his mother.
His mother? Serena, Charles and I think that Russell Thorpe knows about Ben and is gonna use it to sabotage Charles' deal.
I hate to ask this, but I need to make sure that Ben hasn't told anyone about the affidavit, that he hasn't had a change of heart.
No, no, no, of course he hasn't.
But I'll talk to him.
I'm sure everything's fine.
Thank you.
Oh, uh, someone's here.
Um, will you call me after you speak to him? Yeah, of course.
I know you don't wanna speak to me, but Serena won't return my calls, and she told her doorman to tell me she wasn't home even though I saw that she was on "Gossip Girl.
" Can you blame her? It's about Ben.
So if you haven't already guessed, Serena and I are more than just friends.
You think I don't know? Why do you think I came to New York? How'd you figure it out? It doesn't matter.
What matters is that you're giving up any chance of getting your life back for her.
I knew you were gonna say that.
Because it's the truth.
And you don't see it, but you're caught in a trap.
You wanna be the kind of man that Serena Van Der Woodsen could be with.
You could do that.
But not without clearing my name and getting my record expunged, which I can't do without destroying Serena's family.
You can only lose here, Ben.
Mom I think I left my purse upstairs.
Please, uh, tell Serena that I said good-bye.
You were right.
This is a much better idea than spending the day pretending to like some German pedagogue of art.
I'm gonna shop until you drop.
That could happen at any time.
Go to Ralph Lauren.
Have them pull everything in my size.
I'll meet you there.
But, please, myI'm beginning to lose feeling in my fingers.
Well, then go to Cafe Boulud and get us a table.
We'll have lunch.
I thought you were on cleanse.
Excuse me? Why aren't you at Moma meeting me? I decided to grab lunch with my dad instead.
Why aren't you at Moma meeting me? I'm standing you up.
Ah, well, apparently, great minds think alike.
But I had good reason.
And I would love to hear that reason, but my dad is gonna be out any second, and I haven't scouted an exit strategy for you, so We are not done here.
Yeah, we are.
Why would a friendship based on fight suddenly end in flight? They say we only run from the things that truly scare us.
Hey, I was watching you this morning, man.
You looked good.
Thanks.
I was, uh, just leaving.
What's up? I'm looking for Raina.
I thought you might know her schedule.
Or are you going to stand there and lie to my face? Look, we're just hanging out.
Okay? That's it.
I guess the Archibald charm wasn't as rusty as you thought, unlike the knife in my back.
I talked you up to her like you asked me to.
She wanted nothing to do with you.
Don't sugarcoat it.
I like Raina, all right? And she likes me.
I didn't mean for it to happen this way, but it did.
I'm sorry.
What else can I do? There is one thing.
Did you come all the way to Brooklyn just to yell at me? 'Cause that's really not necessary.
Yes, it is.
Dorota saw your "New York" magazine and accused us of having an affair.
That's why I stood you up.
So you mean because we were sneaking around, she assumed we were covering something up? Can you believe it? Well, only because my dad basically told me the same thing.
Look, if anyone else finds out about this They'll jump to the same conclusion.
God.
I knew you'd be my social death, Humphrey.
I just knew it! No, you know what? It's gonna be fine.
We can make it fine.
All we have to do is tell everyone that we've been hanging out.
It's not gonna be a big deal unless we keep making it a big deal.
Right, which it totally isn't.
You know, we should soften the ground, put out an anonymous post on "Gossip Girl" that some big secret is going to come out at Chuck's party.
That way, everyone will assume that some earth-shattering, huge scandal is eminent, like You getting traded for a hotel? Or you raising Georgina's baby by a Russian mobster.
We'll have successfully managed expectations, and by the time our friendship is announced, it'll seem like nothing at all.
So we tell everyone tonight.
Agreed? Agreed.
Oh, and only I get to joke about the hotel.
Still too soon.
A few years ago, my stepmother perjured herself, and an innocent man went to prison.
Why are you telling me this? Because I believe your father already knows.
And I think he's planning to use this information as leverage to blow my deal.
How many times do I have to tell you? He isn't like you.
Maybe not yet, but if I'm right, he's about to cross the line.
You can stop him, Raina.
But if you care about him, you'll do this.
I would never confront him based on your word alone.
I'm not asking you to.
Hey, mom, thanks for coming.
Lunch did not end well.
Serena, we need to talk.
What's she doing here? You need to listen to her.
No, I don't, and neither should you.
Vanessa, tell her.
When Nate's dad was in prison, was he attacked? Yeah, and Nate was pretty upset about it.
Why? What does this have to do with me? Because the person who had him attacked was Ben.
You're lying.
I heard it from Ben himself.
I overheard him telling Damien after Eric's party.
Just get out, please.
Serena, you should be careful.
His sister made me think she was someone else, too.
Darling, I think Vanessa's telling the truth.
Is it possible that you don't know Ben as well as you think you do? Is it possible that he's talked to Russell? Why would Ben care about Russell Thorpe? And if he wanted revenge, he would have gone to the police himself weeks ago.
Besides, the affidavit proves what you did.
Wait a minute.
You didn't destroy it? No.
I-I thought I should hold on to it for safekeeping.
I mean, isn't that why you had it in the safety deposit box in the first place? Did Ben know where you kept it? Yeah, but you don't think Where is it now? Oh, my God.
It's gone.
He took it.
Looks like the jury on Ben might be out after all.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Photo, Chuck? Champagne, sir? Thank you.
Thank you all for coming.
As you know, my deal with Bradley Kidd officially closes tomorrow.
As they always say, why put off till tomorrow a party you could throw today? Cheers.
We're all set.
When I meet Russell in my suite, Raina will be in the kitchen.
As soon as she hears him blackmail me, she'll confront him.
Do you think that'll be enough? The only thing that's more important to him than ruining us is maintaining his relationship with his daughter.
Have you spoken to Ben? He hasn't returned any of my calls.
Hopefully, he didn't hear the panic in my voice and is still coming here.
I know I can talk him out of it.
He just got turned around by his mother.
Well, I'm sure that's so, but if he's already given it to Russell, then it's over.
I'm so sorry, mom.
Ohh.
Don't be.
It's not your mistake.
It never was.
He's here.
Hey.
So did you see the post on "Gossip Girl" about some huge secret coming out tonight? Yeah, and I think I know what it's about.
You do? Ben has the forged affidavit that could put my mother in jail.
We think that he gave it to Russell Thorpe, who's gonna try to blackmail her and Chuck with it.
Oh, my gosh.
S.
, I'm so sorry.
Serena, hey.
Wow.
Listen, I mean, it's really not that big of a deal Impolite to interrupt, Humphrey.
Look, you go talk to Ben, and I'll be here whenever you need me.
Thank you.
What's going on? Did you tell her? Now's not a good time.
Hey.
Are you okay? I know you took it.
What? Don't.
You knew where the affidavit was.
Just please tell me you haven't given it to Russell yet.
Why would I do that? I heard your mother's speech today about how you couldn't have a life until you turned my mother in and turned your back on me.
I guess she convinced you.
After all this time, you still don't trust me? What do I need to do that I haven't done already? Be honest with me.
I have.
Okay.
Well, what about Nate's dad? I had that done, yeah.
But do you know how many things I haven't told you about my time in prison Things that I-I just wanna forget? Look, I know what you were going through, but to have someone attacked Do not tell me that you understand what I went through.
Hi.
Lily? We haven't officially met, but do you know who I am? Let me hazard a guess and say that I'm surprised to see you here, Mrs.
Sharp.
Hey, Russell, good to see you.
Oh.
My friend has arrived.
Good.
Hello, Russell.
How are you? Good to see you.
Are you enjoying yourself? Russell Thorpe.
How do you, uh Ben didn't steal the affidavit.
You did.
Mr.
Thorpe contacted me and said that if I could get Ben to turn on you, then he could get Ben his life back.
Of course, he wouldn't listen, but it didn't matter, because he'd already let it slip about the affidavit.
Ben will never forgive you for what you've done.
Well, as parents, sometimes we have to make those tough choices.
After all, isn't that what you told yourself? Hey, dad, I'm glad you're here.
There's actually something I need to talk to you or tell you about.
Well, am I getting some details this time? On a need-to-know basis, but yes.
Good, because I saw you talking to Blair earlier, and I just about had a heart attack.
What do you mean? Well, just how crazy it would be if your secret relationship was with someone like Blair Waldorf.
No, I know.
I know.
That would that would be crazy.
Um, Rufus, can I talk to you alone? Daniel, would you mind? It's fine.
It's, uh, it's nothing that can't wait.
Lil? What is it? Nate.
Hey.
What are you doing here? I was heading to the bar to meet you.
What are you doing here? You're looking for Chuck.
I am, actually, but You don't understand, and you can't be here.
Chuck is on his way up with my father.
Come on.
So ahem.
Is this quiet enough for you? I should talk to him alone.
No, this is my mess.
Trust me, you're going to need me.
Well, you called this meeting.
You didn't wanna wear that gift I sent you this morning? Orange is so your color.
I have guests downstairs.
And I have the nail for your coffin.
It's just a copy, of course.
Perjury, obstruction of justice, bribery of public officials.
Why don't we cut right to it? That I can do.
You sign over Bass Industries once and for all, or I'll destroy you and your entire family.
I'm surprised you even have to think it over.
I wasn't thinking.
I was waiting.
For what? For me.
He was right about you, this whole time.
He was right.
I'd follow her if I were you.
No.
He signs over the company right now, or you're going to jail.
Maybe, but not because of you or anyone else.
I called the D.
A.
ten minutes ago.
Rufus is waiting in the car to take me downtown.
Lily, you can't.
Once I go on record with the truth no one can hold this against us anymore.
Just promise me one thing.
Before Thorpe leaves here tonight, tell that son of a bitch where he can stick it.
Thank you for saving his legacy.
Bass Industries isn't his legacy, Charles.
You are.
Oh.
You heard the lady.
If that's all, I have guests downstairs.
They can wait.
Don't you even wanna know why why I was willing to sacrifice my own daughter just to destroy your precious little legacy? Because Lily left you for my father.
I think you know me better than that by now.
Did Raina ever talk about her mother? Careful, Chuck.
When it comes to Bart Bass, seek, and who knows what you may find? Raina, wait up.
Hey, wait.
Talk to me.
I can't.
You don't understand.
Trust me.
I do.
And finding out your father isn't the person you grew up idolizing sucks, but it doesn't mean he loves you any less.
Then what does it mean? It means that he's human.
Okay, and you have a chance, if you want, to get to know the real him the good and the bad.
What if I don't want to? You do.
When I was a little girl, he was larger than life Like Superman.
Yeah, but doesn't it make you feel a little better to know that he wasn't? You're smarter than you look, Archibald.
I get that a lot.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You wanna go catch the game highlights somewhere? I just need to not talk about this for a while.
Yeah.
That'd be great.
My mom just left.
She's turning herself in.
D.
A.
already called me to come down.
She told me it was your mother that took the affidavit.
Never should've mentioned it.
I just didn't think she would do something like that.
But I'm to blame for what happened either way.
Pretty sure Damien's the one that went to Thorpe.
Why would he do that? I thought you told him last week you wouldn't cooperate.
That's not exactly what I told him.
I got pretty physical with him a while back, and I told him what I had done to the captain.
You ever have a dream that feels so real, when you wake up, you just wanna lie there with your eyes closed to hold on to it? I barely remember being a teacher at Knightley.
Being with you makes it feel real because you remember.
I do.
But maybe it's time for me to open my eyes and let it go.
You mean let me go.
I obviously have a lot to figure out.
Well, that guy that I fell for at Knightley You're still him.
And I can see that even if you can't.
I don't know.
Maybe one day, when you do You're lying.
Believe me, I wish I were.
Because of your father, my wife is dead.
No.
I confronted my father about the fire when he was alive.
It was an accident.
He owned up to the death of the security guard.
He never mentioned a woman.
Why do you think the security guard was in the building? He was trying to save my wife.
No one knows the truth, not even Raina.
She thinks her mother left me for another man.
When my father died, we were in a good place.
You're trying to rob me of that.
You'd say anything to hurt me.
Perhaps.
But I think you know your father well enough to believe that he was capable of deliberately taking a life.
I hope your stepmother enjoys rotting in jail, protecting the legacy of the great Bart Bass.
Yeah, I'll have the same.
Lily turning herself in is already on "Gossip Girl.
" Looks like my fake post of big news turned out to be prophetic.
This is gonna hit the Upper East Side like a hurricane.
Serena, Eric, Lily They're gonna need us now more than ever.
And not us.
Dan and Blair individual entities, two proper nouns separated by a conjunction.
Or a comma, if if mentioned in a list.
Which is rare, since we have nothing in common, and are, in fact, opposites.
The kind of opposites who do not attract.
Most definitely not.
No.
The world just wasn't ready for a Humphrey/Waldorf friendship.
It's been nice not being friends with you.
Let's let's not do it again sometime.
Hey, everything okay? Shut it down.
What? This.
All of this Shut it down.
Don't let me fall  Thank you for coming down, Mr.
Donovan.
Mrs.
Humphrey has signed a full confession but has one demand she says is non-negotiable that your record be expunged immediately.
I'll be seeing to it personally.
I know it doesn't make up for anything far from it.
But it's a start A fresh start for you.
Thank you.
Ben My daughter has a good heart much bigger than mine.
And she cares for you.
I care for her, too.
I always will.
If you don't mind my asking, you seem in pretty good spirits for someone facing possible jail time.
Do you have kids? A boy Max.
He's almost 8 months.
And does he smile when he looks at you? Yeah, he does.
Well, my kids haven't smiled at me for a long time, and tonight when I told my daughter I was coming down here, she said she was proud of me.
And she smiled.
When we finish up, I'll wake a judge.
I know of your ties to the community.
We won't object to bail.
It's a good thing you've got an excellent lawyer.
You're gonna need him.
Rufus.
Hello.
Will, what the hell are you doing here? Cece called me, told me about, uh, Lily's situation.
Cece called you? That's right.
Jumped in a helicopter as soon as I heard.
Are Serena and Eric here as well? No, they're not, and I suggest you leave.
I'm not the only one that remembers why you were run out of town after your last visit.
I appreciate your concern, Rufus.
Uh, I'll tell you what.
I'll let Cece explain everything.
She's flying in as soon as she can.
What? I don't think Lily quite realizes what she's in for.
It's, uh, time to circle the wagons, Rufus.
It's what we do best.
What are you talking about? You call that a foul? Maybe you're not as smart as you look.
See you upstairs? What are you doing here? You weren't returning my calls.
I was hoping you'd come back here.
I didn't want to leave without saying good-bye.
I'm heading back to Chicago Tonight.
I'm not coming with you.
I know Lily turned herself in, but that doesn't change anything between us.
I wasn't expecting it to.
I just hope one day You can forgive me.
You've grown into an amazing woman, Raina.
You're strong, tough, and decent.
And even if you don't feel proud to be my daughter right now I've never been prouder to be your father.
You look more like your mother every day.
Have you seen Blair? No.
She left a while ago.
I'm assuming she went home.
Chuck, talk to me.
My mom just turned herself in to protect you.
Why'd you shut down the party? Nothing to celebrate.
What are you talking about? The company is safe.
You're about to be the head of your father's empire.
It's what you've always wanted.
What I wanted all I ever wanted was to know him, for him to let me in.
He lied to me until the day he died.
I need to talk to Blair.
She's the only one who will understand.
Understand what? You're not making any sense.
Chuck, maybe you should go upstairs and get some sleep.
I have to find her.
Well, I'll come with you.
The question of whether we can fight fate will always remain a mystery.
What are you doing here? But the bigger question is what happens when we stop fighting it? I don't know.
Is Serena here? No.
What's going on? Is everything okay? I've been walking around the city all night with one all-consuming, paralyzing thought.
"Why am I walking around the city when I live in Brooklyn?" What if my dad and Dorota were right? What if there's another reason we're keeping us a secret? Another reason like what? Plausible deniability? Blair, we kept us a secret 'cause we were afraid there was something more.
You need to go back to Brooklyn.
Not until I know for sure they were wrong, that there is nothing between us.
I can guarantee it.
But just so you're secure in that knowledge, what did you have in mind? Just one kiss, then we can know without a doubt.
I suppose that would work.
One kiss.
That's that.
One kiss, and that's that.
Don't say a word  So? So? Don't wait for too long  Don't say, don't say  Oh, for crying out loud, Humphrey.
X.
O.
X.
O.
Gossip Girl.
Gossip girl here your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Guess the Archibald charm wasn't as rusty as you thought Unlike the knife in my back.
I like Raina, all right, and she likes me.
Because of your father, my wife is dead.
No one knows the truth, not even Raina.
Blair, we kept us a secret 'cause we were afraid there was something more.
You need to go back to Brooklyn.
Not until I know that there is nothing between us.
The only mistake was mine, when I forged Serena's signature.
He signs over the company right now or you're going to jail.
But not because of you or anyone else.
I called the D.
A.
ten minutes ago.
Once I go on record with the truth, no one can hold this against us anymore.
I don't think Lily quite realizes what she's in for.
Time to circle the wagons, Rufus.
The Van Der Woodsen family is no stranger to the tabloids, but this time it appears the mother of all scandals surrounds the mother.
Sources say that Lily Humphrey could be facing up to ten years in prison for forgery and obstruction of justice Turn that off.
And leave me alone, Dorota.
I've taken to my bed.
I thought hearing someone has life worse than yours would help.
Well, your job isn't to think.
It's to serve.
So if I need your help, I'll ring the bell.
Will Lily Humphre end up behind bars? The society queen allegedly forged her daughter's signature on an affidavit that sent an innocent man to jail for almost three years.
The victim, Ben Donovan, has been cleared of all charges, but it's unlikely Lily Humphrey will be so lucky.
She's holed up in her penthouse apartment while her lawyers scramble to work out a deal.
We are currently outside of the Van Der woodsens' Upper East Side residence I didn't realize you stayed.
Good morning to you, too.
You okay? It's surreal.
Everything happening to Lily is because of my dad, and I kinda feel like it's all my fault.
Look, it probably would've happened sooner or later anyway.
Your dad's been calling all morning.
Hello? I already told you my answer.
What do you mean everything could change? Oddsmakers around town are taking bets on the length of her prison sentence.
Serena! H-hey, Ms.
Van Der Woodsen! Has your mother heard any news? Stand back.
Let her through.
Stand back.
Hey, Chuck.
How's Lily holding up? I'm here now.
Aren't you coming over for brunch? Lily thought it would be complicated enough without me.
Oh, my grandmother and my stepfather and my father, who was last seen fleeing from the police? "Complicated" is an understatement.
How are things with William? Well, if I cut everyone out of my life who made a mistake, I wouldn't have anyone left.
On the topic of mistakes, do you know one I might have made to cause Blair to cut me off? You didn't talk to her after your party? She wouldn't let me in her room.
When she said she didn't want to talk to me, I didn't think she meant ever again.
She's not seeing someone, is she? Mm, no, not unless you count Dorota.
She hasn't left her bed in a week.
She's pulling a Camille.
But why? I think her powerful woman path hit a roadblock, and you know how important that is to her.
Thanks for the heads-up.
Give Lily my love.
I will.
Bye.
Mm, come on, lil.
Reading this is not gonna make things any easier.
Well, sometimes it's better to know what's out there.
You know, deal with it, move on.
Lily and I were just talking about moving on.
Oh, what was the topic of that conversation? Oh, yeah you.
How many times do I have to tell you? I am not going anywhere until I know that my children are taken care of in the event that Lily can't do so herself.
It's not like she's dying, Will, no thanks to you.
And Eric and Serena already have a father in their lives.
Step father.
It's not the same.
Oh, please! Be gentlemen, you two.
We're all here for Lily.
Oh, darling.
Oh, you look lovely in your mug shot.
It was smart of you to turn yourself in so you could make sure your hair was done.
Yes, mother, that's why I did it.
Well, fortunately, in a few short hours, I will be immortalized in a much more dignified fashion.
The Taschen book that's, uh, today? It certainly is.
Oh! "Modern Royalty.
" I just love that title.
Hey, mom, dad.
Hey.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hey.
Mm.
Serena, darling, we were Grandma.
Mm, just talking about the portrait.
How can you do a book on modern royalty without including me and my girls? All of my girls.
What is that supposed to mean? Hey, you know, listen, thank you for letting me hide out here.
I just needed a time-out from my mom and my grandma and my dad and your dad.
Oh, yeah.
I mean, of course.
My my house is your safe house.
I'm surprised Serena didn't call you and ask you to be her backup.
She did, but I figured I'd dodge that war.
Hey, does William Carlos Williams go under "w" or "c"? Hmm.
This is the first time I've ever seen you pass up a chance to save Serena, and you're alphabetizing.
What's up? You swear not to tell anyone or laugh? Uh, I'll take your secret to my grave, but laughter is an uncontrollable bodily response.
I kissed Blair Waldorf.
Wow.
I didn't see that comin'.
Yeah, neither did I.
Uh, I mean it was just it was just once, and it was weird.
Oh, I would expect so, yes.
But weird good? Like, "I wow, it's weird this is such a good kiss"? Or weird bad? Like, you know, just, "wow.
Weird"? Uh she didn't give you any indication at the time? No.
No, she she just walked away, stunned, left me standing there in her foyer.
Mysterious.
I know, right? I mean, I did what I thought was the polite thing called her the next day.
It's been almost a week, and I haven't heard back.
W-wait, wait.
Why do you care so much? Do you do you like her? What? No.
No, no, no.
I don't like her.
No, of course not.
Not at all.
I'm just curious.
Sh and and, you know, she I mean, she does smell nice.
Oh! You are ass-backwards crushing on Blair Waldorf! Take that away, Dorota! I can't eat.
I only rang to tell you to call the doctor.
I think I have consumption.
Consumption not since 19th century.
They have vaccine.
Well, then I'm dying of malaise.
I know everything has gone wrong since you lost focus on work, but Carmela on "Sopranos" didn't get big break till she was 40.
This isn't about work or time, Dorota.
It's about the truth.
Something happened recently that revealed my future, and I've been hiding ever since 'cause I don't want to deal with it.
Epperly? What do you want? I'm styling the photo shoots for the New York portions of Taschen's "Modern Royalty" book.
I know all about it.
Serena's in it.
Well, my assistant just left me to work for William and Kate's wedding photographer.
I could really use your help.
Me? After our previous experience? Aw, you're a natural fit for something like this, what with your impeccable taste and masterful way of giving orders.
Um, it'll be hard to clear my schedule.
Meet me in an hour? I'll text you the address.
You're right, Dorota.
Maybe I should refocus on work.
Feelings and revelations will just have to wait.
She accepted the job, just like you knew she would.
But, uh Why go to these lengths, if I may ask? Someone told me something that made me want my own legacy, not my father's.
I can't convince Blair of her place in it until she's feeling powerful again.
Well, I hope it works out for you.
Ever since I came back from Bali, I'm a sucker for romance.
I can't believe you asked Carol here without clearing it with me first.
What's to ask? You're her sister.
And besides, I knew you'd say no.
Oh, for good reason, though, because Carol turned her back on Lily.
Well, I would say that there was some blame on both sides.
But Rufus does make a point for once.
You know, having Carol here would be stressful for Lily.
Oh, my God.
What could be more stressful than this? She hasn't even walked through the door, and you guys are already at each other's throats.
I wouldn't recognize you guys if it were any other way.
Hi, sis! I always knew your house of cards would collapse eventually, but I never dreamed you'd actually wind up behind bars.
Ah, welcome, Carol.
And hey! Mom.
Darling.
And Lily's husbands one and five? Five.
And Serena.
Hi, aunt Carol.
Good to see you.
Oh, my.
Your mom used to have long hair just like yours, but that's when she was crashing on tour buses, before she was getting Brazilian blowouts.
Right, Rufus? Love the loafers.
Are those Tod's? Carol, some of us actually grew up.
I'll get it.
So, Carol, you're here for the Rhodes women portrait.
Maybe you could help us pick a theme.
I was thinking "La Dolce Vita.
" Does it have to be a movie? We could do "Chicago.
" You could play Roxie Hart 'cause she was in jail.
I know you think this photo's frivolous, but it's an important honor for our family.
I'm not the one who ruined this family's honor.
It wasn't your lawyer.
It was someone from the book.
They canceled the portrait because of the scandal.
I'm sorry, mom.
Uh-oh, Lily.
Looks like instead of being on the pages, you're about to have the book thrown at you.
Do you mind hailing me a cab? Thank you.
Hey, Serena? Sorry.
My family's not talking to the press.
Oh, well, then I guess I'm not either, because, technically, I'm your family.
You're probably wondering how you could be related to someone who's so socially awkward.
Um but I'm your cousin.
Charlie! Oh, my God! I mean, Charlotte.
Oh, my gosh! Your mom didn't tell me you were here! That's because she doesn't know.
Um can we go somewhere and talk? Yeah, of course.
Come on.
Boys, William may have a solution.
Imagine that.
I know Benedikt Taschen personally.
Of course you do.
I'd be happy to call him, see if I can get the ladies back in the book.
Eric, what do you say? Uh, well, I-I think that mom would really like that.
Fine.
Might as well try.
Great.
Thanks.
I think the last time I saw you, I was 6.
You met up with us in the keys on Claus' boat.
Um, I think they call that a yacht.
Didn't it have an elevator in it? Yeah, which apparently was enough to make your mom decide to never let you see us again.
Well, she thinks your world's toxic.
If I'm exposed, I'll catch it.
Oh, well, we may not be perfect, but comparing us to the plague is a little extreme.
Okay.
So you and your brother didn't both end up going to a mental institution? And your dad didn't give your mom fake cancer? And your mom didn't send an innocent man to prison just to get you back into private school.
Yeah, maybe when you put it that way, we should be quarantined.
No.
I'm sorry.
That's my mom talking.
I've grown up so alone, that I I wanted to see what she's been hiding from me all these years.
Okay.
Well, I'm not letting you go home until you spend a day with me.
Let me show you this world, and you can decide for yourself what you think of it.
We'll start with Barneys and then work our way back to intermix.
I'm sorry, Lil.
I didn't realize how important this portrait was to you.
Whatcha looking at? Well, I just figured if I can't take a new photo, I could distract myself with old ones, that's all.
Remember that? My God.
We were gonna audition to be "Solid Gold" dancers.
And then we went looking for halter tops that looked like the girl in the "Cherry Pie" video.
Yeah, and all we could find were these gold unitards.
Oh, how'd our dance go? It was like This was our audition.
This was our audition.
Right, right.
Imagine, in halter tops.
Okay.
No.
Oh, you know what? Who needs Taschen when we can take our own family photo? But we need the unitards.
Yes.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Kat Orth is being shot with her six maiden nieces, and Chuck Bass will be shot by himself.
All by himself? He has an uncle.
Nope.
Chuck Bass is representing his family all alone.
The Suttons are next.
They want to be shot with their English setters.
The setters are better-looking than the Suttons.
Aw, but they love each other anyway, just proving that everyone has their soul mate.
Yeah, did you join a cult in Bali? Oh, come on, Blair.
I know you believe in true love, too.
Well, I did recently have a moment of perspective myself, but thankfully, I didn't have to go to an Ashram to have it.
What happened? I kissed someone, and it was truly a life-changing experience.
Do tell.
I just did.
That was it.
But the point is, that one kiss changed me.
Fut-the-wuck is she doing here? how dare you show your face here? Oh, well, hello to you, too, Blair.
I'm a camera assistant.
The job was posted at N.
Y.
U.
I didn't know Serena's family was coming until I arrived, and no, I'm not leaving.
Oh, my God.
Wow, that dress is incredible.
It would look great on you.
Uh, yeah, except for it costs as much as all the stuff we got today put together, so I can't accept that.
Well you can accept this.
It's a family heirloom, so it's just as much yours as it is mine anyway.
Serena Thank you For everything.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe we found them.
You might be Upper East Side blue blood, and I might be Florida bohemian, but at bottom, the Rhodes sisters are still badasses from the valley.
Rufus! Yeah, we found leg warmers.
No, I'm not drunk.
Although Yes! Oh, that's wonderful.
You're kidding! Okay, we'll be right home.
The photo shoot's back on.
Oh! Should we go back and buy something for everyone? Mom in a unitard.
Awesome.
I love it! - Serena? - Charlie? I can explain.
Hey, Chuck, uh, what what are you doing here? May I come in? Yeah.
I've learned some information about my past that's making me reconsider my future my future with Blair.
However, my intel indicates that she's seeing someone else.
What's that got to do with me? I think it could be someone at "W".
Didn't you work there? Uh yeah.
For one day.
Did you notice her talking to anyone? Whoever she kissed seems to have had an effect "life-changing" were the words she used.
Uh, well a life-changing kiss might not be something you wanna mess with.
What are you trying to say, Humphrey? With you, she was always caught up in schemes and takedowns, but that's not that's not really her.
She's intelligent.
She's intuitive, you know? She she weeps when she watches "Nights of Cabiria.
" How do you know that? Uh Serena told me, but listen, the point is, if Blair's happy, then maybe you should let her be.
You care more about Blair's happiness than I knew.
Yeah.
Thank you for your time.
Epperly, I found out who Blair kissed.
I'm going to need one more favor.
I worked hard to keep you away from this world.
I didn't want you to become a socialite obsessed with clothes and clubbing and getting your picture taken.
That's not fair.
Fair is irrelevant.
I'm your mother.
I make the rules.
You need to trust me.
I have never lied to you.
Listen, I want you to return everything that you bought and meet me back at my hotel.
Uh, necklace? For God sakes, Carol, it's a necklace, not a heroin needle.
We were just hanging out.
And you bought her $1,000 worth of clothes.
That's obscene.
We're leaving.
I'm just here to say good-bye to mother.
I just got your message.
I can't believe you won't come upstairs.
Carol, please.
Serena didn't mean any harm.
You and I were just having so much fun together, and William and Rufus got the photo shoot back on.
At least stay for that.
You may think it's okay for your kids to have superficial values, but I left this life to raise Charlie in the real world, and I am not letting you seduce her.
Great, then I hope you won't mind if I don't stay and watch you go.
Hey, you okay? Oh, yes, I'm fine, sweetheart.
Mwah.
You don't have to come up.
Funny.
Wanting nothing to do with this superficial world hasn't deterred you from taking my money.
Oh, you got what you paid for, mother.
I showed up.
I was as supportive as I possibly could be, and now I'm leaving.
I send you a check every month.
You will stay for this photo.
That wasn't part of the deal.
Now I'm going to my hotel to pack, and Charlie and I are gonna take the next plane out.
So get this I got a call that I'm being included in the "Modern Royalty" book.
Hmm, no offense, but why? Oh, none taken, 'cause that was my first thought also.
For up and comers.
Uh, yeah, that sounds totally made up.
Um, you know, Blair is working the photo shoot.
She called to confirm my mom's call time.
Maybe she got you in? Why, to raise my social status so I'll be a more suitable suitor? Actually, that sounds completely like her.
And you would usually find that repellent, except you don't, because you like her.
Uh Does Serena know? It was one kiss.
There's nothing to know yet.
Just be be careful? And and and, um And wear a nice suit.
I have to go.
Hello? Yeah, this is Eric.
What? No, I didn't know I was expected at the photo shoot.
You're late.
And you're glowing.
Why make me bring overnight bag, including La Perlas? Because I'm going to tell that certain someone my true feelings tonight, and if everything goes as I hope, I don't wanna be caught in last year's Chantelle.
I don't think Dan Humphrey will know difference.
Dan Humphrey? What are you talking about? The reason you take to bed.
Shame from emotional affair with lowly boy.
It's lonely boy, and it wasn't an affair just a kiss, which made me see how much I wished it was with Chuck.
Mr.
Chuck? But your power play go kaput.
Thank you for reminding me.
Look, I wanted to realize my full potential before joining forces with a powerful man, but Chuck has matured past games and fatwas.
I believe we can build our futures together.
And if Chuck is destined to be my prince, why kiss any more toads? Humphrey more labrador than toad.
Who cares what beast Dan Humphrey is? Chuck is on his way.
I'm gonna tell him I'm ready.
It's time.
They say that fortune favors the bold.
Thanks.
Serena.
Look, I'm sorry I left without saying good-bye, but as much fun as I had, my mom is right.
You know, she sacrificed a lot to raise me the way she thought was best.
I have to respect that.
Well, she may not have sacrificed as much as you think.
But watch out for the bold-faced lies that come with fortune's favors.
Hi.
Grandma, the book people called and told me I had to come down here A.
S.
A.
P.
Oh! Are you Eric Van Der Woodsen? All right.
We need to start setting up for you and your sister.
And are you Dr.
Van Der Woodsen? No.
Uh, wh-what's going on? Uh, the revised portrait concept is William Van Der Woodsen and his two children.
What? No, the whole point was to do this for my mom.
I think the point for Will is to always do something for himself.
We have to fix this.
You find William.
I'll make sure that Lily's occupied.
And you say absolutely nothing to anybody until I tell you.
Hey.
Hey.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Your office said you were I just needed some time to think.
About what? What'd your dad say? It wasn't my dad on the phone.
It was the people doing the "Modern Royalty" book.
They were calling for the same reason he was.
They want us in the book.
And you said no, of course.
Yes.
But then they asked if I didn't want to pose with my father, why not take it with my mother? Oh.
Having to say it out loud this morning made me realize if I'm estranged from my dad I really have no one.
Blair.
Hey.
Uh I wanted to talk to you for a second, but I can see you've got your hands full.
The Landsburys had too much licorice.
Wh-what's up? I'm ready to get my photo taken.
For the "Up and Comers" section, you know? This isn't a photo shoot for a high school yearbook.
There is no "Up and Comers" section, and even if there were, I mean, let's face it, Humphrey.
You still wouldn't make the cut.
Tell me you didn't do this just to humiliate me.
What? No.
I don't even know what "this" is.
Epperly called me and told me I was in the shoot.
What, you didn't you didn't have anything to do with that? No, and I don't know why epperly would Oh, God.
It's Chuck.
He knows.
Ah, bellissima.
Oh, you are so beautiful.
Thank you for being here.
Of course.
We've been through so much together, and I let you down so many times.
And here you are.
Mom, don't start to cry right now.
You'll ruin your makeup.
Stop.
What have you done with my daughter? What are you talking about? Charlie.
She never made it to the hotel, and she doesn't know the city.
She's out there somewhere on her own.
Ugh! I knew it! One day with you, and she's run away.
This is not a coincidence.
Watch how you talk to my daughter.
She didn't run away because of me.
She ran away because I told her the truth about you.
You go around acting like we're monsters, yet you take money from grandma every month.
Is that true? I'm sorry, mom.
I overheard them earlier.
The only reason she came here is because grandma paid her to.
I'll call Charlie now and see if she'll tell me where she is.
Of course mother paid you to be here.
I am so foolish to think that you would have come because you cared.
Lily This was all you, wasn't it? You had Epperly hire me and call Dan and tell him that he was an An "Up and Comer"? What the hell is your problem, man? You're trying to humiliate him? What, is that it? I don't care about him one way or the other.
I just wanted you to see he's not part of this world.
I know you kissed him.
So? You and I are not dating.
And you kiss a lot of people.
You're not supposed to kiss him.
He's humdrum Humphrey.
Epperly told me it was life-changing.
Because it made me realize I wanted to be with you.
Dan and I both know it meant nothing less than nothing.
Right? Yeah, that's right.
I was gonna tell you all about it tonight.
But that would have been a huge mistake.
Dan Humphrey may not be royalty, but at least he's not a child.
Hey.
Lily in makeup yet? We know you switched the photo from Rhodes to Van Der Woodsen.
I-I don't know what you're talking about.
Sure you don't, but let me tell you.
Having a picture with you and your kids doesn't make you look like a real father.
Back off, Rufus.
Look, there's just there's no photo without my mom.
Of course there isn't.
I wouldn't wanna cut your mother out of anything.
It's over, Will.
Just fix it before Lily finds out.
Finds out about what? Finds out that, um, that I'm not happy with my hair.
It's too flat.
Mother, your hair is enormous.
We're ready for the Van Der Woodsen photo.
Oh, it's the Rhodes photo, and we're here.
Okay, I couldn't find Charlie.
What's going on? You gonna tell 'em what you did? No, because I didn't do it.
Would everybody please take their places? Does anyone want to be in this picture or in this family? I do.
Cinderella finally showed up at the ball.
Too bad it was canceled.
Oh, thank God.
Are you all right? You had me worried sick! I'm fine.
Uh, this is only supposed to be William Van Der Woodsen and his two children.
What? Since when? Yeah, I'm sorry, Lily.
The book never reinstated you.
Will did this instead.
Dad? What's the point of telling the truth if you're not gonna believe me anyway? I'm gonna go get some air.
This looks like the dress Diana wore the day after she became princess.
It is.
I wanted you to wear it in the photo with me.
I had no idea I could just ask.
It's not too late.
You don't have to be powerful on your own first.
We can build our futures together.
The saddest part is that I'd come to the same conclusion.
But now that I know I'm ready, I realize you're not.
What? And I thought that after everything you went through Prague, Eva, Russell, that Maybe you'd changed.
But who was I kidding? Don't say that.
You have years before you're capable of a real relationship, if you ever will be.
I'm sorry, Chuck.
Ah.
Lily, I did not sabotage the photo shoot.
I hope that you realize that.
Ohh.
I'm not even sure I care if you did.
I mean, let's face it.
Me, Cece, and Carol all in the same room the night was doomed to be apocalyptic.
But the fact that my rebel sister has been judging me all these years when she was taking money from my mother that's a whole new spin.
Remember when she moved to Maui, Dallas, and then downtown Detroit? Anywhere your mother wouldn't go? And now she lives on a houseboat.
And you live in a penthouse.
Yeah, for now.
And then it's the big house.
Lily Tonight was supposed to be a way to forget that.
Listen, nobody knows what your sentence will be, and your family's here for you, even though they're screwed up and dance in silver leotards.
Unitards, and they were gold.
Thank you, William.
You're right.
I just spoke to Julia chaplin and found out that Benedikt Taschen was traveling and never got your message.
The Van Der Woodsen photo was the editor's idea, and William had nothing to do with it.
Well, if that's an apology, Rufus, uh, I accept.
Come on.
Let's, uh Go get our family and go home.
I had no idea.
I know.
Nice suit, though.
Thanks.
Uh what did you want to talk to me about earlier? Oh, I just wanted to make sure you knew that that kiss meant nothing to me like it did to you.
Oh.
Right.
Social experiment gone wrong.
A princess kissing a labrador.
Uh, I appreciate you not calling me a toad.
Uh Blair, your prince is out there waiting for you.
It might not be me or Chuck, but he's out there.
Your princess is, too, if you're ready for her.
All these years, all you did was lie to me.
I made some mistakes, but I was trying to protect you.
How, by secretly taking money? By making me feel horrible about who my relatives were? I'm not 8, mom.
I'm 18.
I don't need to be protected.
I only wanted what was best for you.
You mean what's best for you.
Well, that ends tonight.
Charlie, don't.
So epic betrayal by mom, aborted photo shoot, no place to sleep.
What would Serena Van Der Woodsen do? Well, the salted caramel gelato at Il Laboratorio can end wars.
Take me there.
Did someone say "gelato"? Oh, Blair, this is my cousin, Charlie Rhodes.
Hi.
The Blair.
I'm honored.
And I'm craving vanilla pecan and a girls' night.
Let's get outta here.
Come on.
Poor lost prince.
What's the point of having a kingdom if you have to reign alone? Still no word on the sentencing? Uh, no, not yet.
Um Did you know that Martha Stewart taught crafts in prison? The flight's in a few hours.
I hope we hear by then.
And I hope that Charlie speaks to me on the plane.
Serena said they had a great girls' night.
Probably just what she needed in light of, you know, your decades of massive hypocrisy.
I so wanted you to think I was different, that I'd gotten out.
Oh, when you left L.
A.
, I had I had no one.
And then one day, I was buying a pregnancy test at that drugstore up on Laurel.
Everything changed.
I did not want mom's help, but it wasn't about me anymore.
Why didn't you tell me? And have you find out I failed? After you rejected me and everything I stood for? No way! I did not reject you.
All I ever wanted was your approval.
Well, you got it now.
Turning yourself in, not giving a damn what people think that's my Lily.
Will you come visit me in prison? I will smuggle you pot brownies.
So have you thought about what you're gonna say to your mom yet? I figured it would just kind of come to me in the moment.
She's never gonna let me do it.
What is this "let"? You're an adult.
You make your own decisions, and you say that you hope that she supports you.
I'm starting to realize why you're so scary to her.
You wanna get that? No.
So I know you don't want to hear from me, but I had to share.
Dan Humphrey kissed Blair Waldorf.
You can confront them.
They'll deny it, but it's true.
I overheard them myself, and believe me, if I was lying just to mess with you, it wouldn't be something as unbelievable as this.
I'm surprised Rufus is letting you man the brunch table.
He's usually very territorial about his waffles.
Your stepfather and I have come to an understanding.
Besides, he's out on a mission right now.
Well, I am intrigued and proud of both of you.
I know you're making this work for my sake.
Oh, and here I thought you were doing it for me.
Hey, mom.
Hi, sweetheart.
How was the sleepover? It was good.
It was so good, that, um If it's okay with you, aunt Lily, I-I'd like to stay in Serena's old room, catch up with the family, make up for lost time.
Oh, I think that's great, Charlie.
Charlie, that's a mistake.
What happened wasn't so long ago.
You're not ready for this.
I am.
Because of you, I know who I am, and nothing's gonna change that.
And thanks for supporting me.
Why don't I show you your new room? My God.
I suck at that.
You'll get better with practice.
What? She's gonna be fine.
We'll take good care of her you don't understand.
A few months ago, she left college because Wh-what's going on, Carol? Just promise me that you will make sure someone watches her closely, okay? I promise.
Hey, you're awake.
I'm not sure if I ever fell asleep.
You, uh still thinking about your mom? Yes, but not for the reason you think.
My dad always said she never tried to contact us.
But I can't help but wonder since he lied about so much other stuff maybe he lied about her, too.
You could find out for sure, you know.
You could look for her.
Walking down the Primrose path, you risk finding hell instead of happily ever after.
Save me a waffle, but first we have a surprise.
You're socializing with my mother? That is surprising.
Rufus has gathered the family, darling.
The whole family, because we are having a family photo.
Lily, I assume you know Laurie Simmons? So great.
Hi.
Uh, this is a family portrait, so I'm assuming you are cousin Charlie.
Yeah.
Hi.
You're Dan? - Yeah.
How long you gonna be here? Um depends, I guess.
Okay, I'm good to go if everyone else is.
Ah, Cece, come on.
You're sitting next to me.
Oh, how about if I'm in the middle between you and William? All right.
Look at me.
Lily, you want me to Oh, that's all right.
Um just let it ring.
I want my family photo to capture this moment.
That's my Lily.
Okay, say "cheese.
" As with any journey, who you travel with can be more important than your destination.
Why does love have to be so hard, Dorota? All I ever wanted was a simple fairy tale.
Kate Middleton has it, and I have much shinier hair.
Although she does have a better assortment of hats.
Don't despair, miss Blair.
Destiny full of surprises.
You never know who you'll encounter along the way.
Who knows? Maybe fairy tales come true after all.
X.
O.
X.
O Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here-- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I'm assuming you are cousin Charlie.
I'd like to stay.
Why don't I show you your new room? I know you don't wanna hear from me, but Dan Humphrey kissed Blair Waldorf.
You said that you were responsible for a fire in one of your own buildings.
I've had that man's death on my conscience for 20 years.
Someone died? Why do you think the security guard was in the building? He was trying to save my wife.
My dad always said she never tried to contact us, but I can't help but wonder, since he lied about so much other stuff I called the D.
A.
Ten minutes ago.
Once I go on record with the truth, no one can hold this against us anymore.
We can build our futures together.
Now that I know I'm ready, I realize you're not.
I think I just met a real-life prince.
Will I ever see you again? You can always come find me.
Diamonds are a girl's best friend, but ask any Upper East Side girl to show you her most prized possession And we bet the box is Vivier, not Cartier.
Miss Blair, you have not taken off the shoes since it arrived.
You must rest your feet.
There's no time for rest.
Didn't you read Louis' note? He wants to spend the day with me, and we still haven't picked out the perfect dress.
Where's Serena? At Van Der Woodsens'.
Miss Serena been very good daughter since miss lily get sentenced to house arrest.
Well, now she's gonna be a very good friend because I'm going to raid her closet.
But the truth is just because the shoe fits, doesn't mean you want to wear it.
Hey, mom.
We're back from our tour of the best pastry shops in Manhattan.
I did a linzer tart taste test.
I had three espressos and then I picked a fight with a barista.
Then I have the perfect place for you to channel your energy.
Laryssa is out running errands, and I need someone to help me clear this out before everyone gets here.
By "this", do you mean the spoils of your online shopping safari? And by "everyone", you mean, uh-- I invited the planning committee to help put together the gift bags for the pink party.
I figure it's the least I can do, and it'd be nice to hang with the girls.
And they're--they're coming? Why wouldn't they? Well, I just thought that, you know, with the-- nonsense.
They're my friends.
Eric, do you mind helping mom? I, uh, need to talk to Charlie about something privately.
Thanks for the movies.
You wanna come over later and join us for some screenings? Um you know what? I might--I might have a thing.
A thing? That's intriguingly vague.
Another development in the complicated non-friends hang-out situation? No, that situation has figured itself out.
It's official.
We're, uh, we're just friends.
Uh, no, the thing today is actually a job.
I got a call from the editor of "Paris Match.
" Read my blog in "w," wants me to do some additional reporting on a story for them today.
Dan, that's that's fantastic.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I should be, uh, happy, but it--the piece seems kinda sleazy.
The editor got some tip that this European Prince is gonna be in town, wants to do a day-in-the-life story, like what a royal does in New York, and the guy doesn't like the media, apparently, which in this case is me, so that means I gotta follow him.
And we're talking staking out his hotel.
Provided this Prince isn't rolling with Lindsay Lohan, I don't know what he has to hide.
I think it's a great opportunity.
Well, uh, let the record show I put up a Valiant fight.
Uh, speaking of fights, where do things stand with you and Vanessa? Have you guys talked? Uh, yes, only to reiterate the fact that we have nothing to talk about.
You know, I was angry with Vanessa, too, but you guys have been friends your whole lives.
That's not something you give up without some thought.
This say "sexy and smart.
" No, it says "let's get dinner and make a s*x tape.
" Keep looking.
Hello? Bonjour, Blair.
C'est Louis.
Did you get the package I sent you? Of course I did.
Although I-I must say I was a bit surprised.
I-I thought you'd never wanted to see me again after the way I left you in Paris.
No, not at all, unless the reason you left Paris is still in your life.
Uh no, no.
He isn't.
Um, that's over.
Then we are both free with, I hope, a perfect day ahead of us.
Exactly, and you are in my country now.
I'm going to introduce you to all the best New York has to offer.
Tell your valet to press your suit, because following an afternoon of museums and cafes, we're going to the pink party, an exclusive gathering of New York's elite society.
I'm afraid No one but you can know I'm here, Blair.
Is that okay? Of course.
I've recently learned of a few places that nobody like us would ever be caught dead in, so I'm going to create you a new itinerary and text you how we should meet.
A trs bientt, impatiente de te voir.
Moi aussi.
What's with the emergency text? We're gonna be late for class.
Oh, I'm not making it to class today, which is why you'll be taking notes for me.
But it's nearly finals.
What's more important than school? Miss Blair has a date with-- actually, I'd rather not say who just yet.
I'm taking a page from Gwyneth and Chris.
The relationship means too much to me to be dissected by the masses.
Hand me that m.
C.
L.
Cuff I gave you for Christmas.
Oh, perfect.
If she won't say who it is, I know someone who can find out for us.
Okay, so the idea is that we search the "Gossip Girl" archives for evidence of Dan and Blair sneaking around so you know for sure if Vanessa's telling the truth? That's the basic idea.
And I'm sorry.
I'm still new at this.
How is that better than just asking them? Well, because if Vanessa is lying and it isn't true, then I'm a horrible friend for believing her, but if it is true, then they're horrible friends for not telling me.
Right there.
They went out of town together.
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
They went to cornwall to find Juliet because she drugged me and tried to convince everyone I was crazy.
Sure 'Cause that happens.
They were spotted seeing a film Dan lives at the film forum, and Blair was obsessed with that orangutan.
It could be a coincidence.
Hey, Upper East Siders, word is that b.
Is headed for a secret rendez-vous.
Question is, with who? Okay, are you ready to help me out, Upper East Side style? First, I need to teach you how to use the "Gossip Girl" spotted" map.
Hey.
Dan's standing outside of some restaurant called Veselka, but he's definitely acting weird.
Veselka, and guilty-weird or hungry-weird? The man loves his pierogies.
You know, I'm not very good at this.
Maybe you should just come down here and see for yourself.
See, I can't.
That's the double-edged sword of "Gossip Girl" I'd be spotted.
Okay.
He's going inside.
Stand by.
Someone else just arrived in a town car.
Humphrey! You have to leave.
No one can see me here, and although you fall under that moniker, I still need you to go.
Me? Wh-what are you doing here, deep in N.
Y.
U.
Territory? Iv you've developed a passion for Ukrainian food, then I think we did spend too much time together.
Actually, I'm on a date.
You can handle that, right? We're just friends.
Date away.
Okay.
You didn't see me here.
Okay.
Hi! I'm sorry, Serena, but it's Blair.
She's inside with Dan right now.
I think I think they're on a date.
Poor s.
Apparently, Blair and Dan's boots are made for walking Right all over you.
Look who it is! Blair and-- Serena! Louis! Bonjour, Serena.
Nice to see you.
Excuse us.
It was so romantic.
My Vivier arrived with a note from Louis.
Usually I'd make him wait a standard 48 hours before going on a date, but I make exceptions for royalty.
And you bring royalty to Veselka.
Believe me, I'd rather be at Petrossian, but he's here in secret, so he has to keep a low profile, and what's lower than this? Look, Serena, you can't say anything to anyone.
As much as I'd love to tell the world, this must remain a secret for now.
I won't say a word, but I do expect a full report.
Of course.
It'll start like this.
"Once upon a time" A girl kept her date waiting too long.
Go, go, go.
So what happened? Blair wasn't with Dan.
She was with a guy named Louis Grimaldi.
They met in Paris last summer.
But I saw Dan go in.
You've met so many people in such a short amount of time, anyone would get confused.
I remember him.
I'm telling you, it was Dan.
Look, you did great.
We have confirmation that Blair wasn't with Dan and that Vanessa was lying.
Mission accomplished.
You ready to go uptown? Um you know, actually, can I meet you later? I was hoping I could check out N.
Y.
U.
While I was down here.
Yeah, of course.
Have fun.
All I know about my mom is that her name is Avery thorpe, and she had me when she was 22.
Maybe you should talk to Chuck about this.
He went through something very similar.
I'm not ready to discuss this with anyone but you.
Do you think this will be enough for the private investigator to find her? Yeah, it's worth a call.
Single malt for breakfast? Takes the edge off the coke.
I'm gonna go make that call.
Is there a problem? With Raina, no.
But when you're ready to talk about whatever's up with you, let me know.
Hi.
Ah, the warm greeting of a friendship off the tracks.
Come on, Vanessa.
I'm--I'm making an effort here.
Apologies for being thrown by your sunny attitude.
You've made it pretty clear that you're done with me.
I know I have, I know I have, but I was with my dad today, and I swung by Veselka.
Listen, I'm right by campus.
You wanna grab some coffee? So all my heartfelt attempts to save our friendship had no impact, but the aroma of cheese and dough turned you instantly sentimental? They do say smell is the sense most associated with memory.
Well, I'm--I'm heading to school now, but I have class.
I could do drinks later tonight.
Hey, what are you doing by N.
Y.
U.
? Don't you have off Fridays? Yeah, I do, but I got this writing job down here, uh, and then I realized it was a conflict of interest, so I quit, and, uh, now I-- well, why don't I explain everything to you tonight? Okay.
I'll, um, I'll see you then.
All right, good.
Oh, hello, darling.
How are you? Oh, I'm fine.
Fine.
So is someone else bringing the items for the gift bags? I'm so sorry, Lily.
Helping out was a lovely thought, but with the party for the breast cancer research foundation being tonight, we felt it would just be easier to do the gift bags at Blaine's during prep.
Well, I'm disappointed, of course, but the success of the event is the, uh, priority.
Would you mind asking Vanya to send over the food? I would hate for it to go to waste.
You know how the trumps love their tea sandwiches.
Of course.
Ahem.
I'm fine, really.
Hey! Where are they going with those scones? Uh, my guess is Blaine trump's.
I think your mother may have underestimated the impact of her sentence on her social standing.
The only thing thicker than blood is the ink on "page six.
" Where's Raina? She went back to her hotel.
I think your whole, uh, Howard Hughes routine is starting to freak her out a little bit.
It's actually starting to freak me out, too, man.
Talk to me.
I saw what you two were looking at this morning-- the tattered box, old photographs.
Is Raina looking for her mother? It's a mistake.
You have to stop her.
Look, man, I know what happened with your mom was painful.
But at least you got some answers.
Raina deserves the same, and she can handle it.
You don't know that.
Raina's been away at college, living a high-profile life which anyone could follow online.
If her mother wanted to get in touch with her, she would have done it by now.
Raina just lost her father.
Do you really think she's ready to be rejected by her mother all over again? I'll talk to her.
Andrew, it's Chuck bass.
I need you to find out everything you can about the fire at the Kinberg building.
I need to know Was Avery thorpe there that night? I was so focused on getting the perfect outfit that I didn't realize it was freezing outside.
Will you go get me a cardigan from upstairs? Is everything okay? That was Lucien, my royal advisor.
I'm afraid I've been found out.
My parents have been informed, and Lucien's on a plane now to escort me back to Paris.
I don't understand.
Just because you wanted a weekend away in New York? The truth is, I'm here to see you.
I've mentioned you many times since the summer, but my parents don't approve.
You are a commoner.
Well, have they have seen Princess Stephanie's husbands? I'm not a circus performer.
You're anything but common.
But the royal birthright has many strings attached.
When my advisor discovered I was in New York, he hired one of your friends to follow me.
I will see to it personally that Penelope is deported to a desperate third world country, preferably someplace with Sharia Law.
It was a man.
He saw us at Veselka.
Dan Humphrey? He--he wouldn't do that.
Lucien probably made him a very good offer.
I was a fool to think I'd be allowed to follow my heart, even if only for a few days.
Go back to your hotel and put on your suit.
I know who can fix this.
Hey.
Meet me at Paul Smith in half an hour.
You know why, and you should be ashamed of yourself.
How did you find out? I always find out.
Just be there.
Charlie may be new to the city, but apparently she already knows how to get around.
Who needs a map when you can just follow the cheater? Blair, I swear I had no idea.
Some magazine editor called me out of the blue to hire me to write an article on your Prince, and I backed out the minute I knew he was with you.
Oh, you should have been suspicious the minute someone wanted to pay you for your writing.
That wasn't an editor.
It was one of Louis' royal handlers, and your desperate need for literary validation cost me the greatest date of my life.
Well, I'm sorry.
I know you are, and that is why I'm giving you the opportunity to make this right.
Louis told his handler, Lucien, that he came to New York for a charity event tonight, and Lucien doesn't believe him, so when he comes to pick Louis up from the party to take him to the airport.
We are going to convince him that Louis is a casual summer acquaintance, and you and I are madly in love.
Why would he believe that? We are going to stage a private intimate moment for Lucien to stumble upon.
When he realizes that Louis was telling the truth and he has nothing to worry about, he'll go back to Paris, leaving Louis behind for me.
No way.
I thought you were my friend.
I am, which is why I'm going to point out to you what a bad idea this is.
For starters, Serena's gonna be at this party.
She's staying with lily tonight.
Fine, then everyone else in the world will be at this party.
We'd have to tell Serena about the plan.
Absolutely not.
You and I faking a kiss-- do you really wanna have that conversation with Serena? Can't be half as painful as this one.
Think ahead, Humphrey.
What if Serena tells Chuck, who, though up till now, quiet about our misbegotten make-out, decides to speak up in the face of this latest insult? When you bring Chuck into it, you're far more convincing.
Okay, fine.
You're paying for the tie.
What about "it's a wonderful life"? That'll cheer mom up.
No, no, she's in a dark place.
She has to work out her issues with "The Godfather" or "Taxi Driver.
" What about "intolerance"? That pretty much sums up this situation.
I was hoping to find one sympathetic pink party planner to advocate on your mom's behalf, get the party moved here from the trumps' so she could be a part of it.
You know, I might live on the Upper East Side, but I have no pull here.
Now if the pink party was at CBGB's I hate to break it to you, but CBGB's is a clothing store now.
You know, now that I think about it, there is a way we could get the party moved.
All you'd have to do is make a slight moral compromise.
Eric, I know what you're talking about.
I'm not doing that.
Not doing what? Bubbles mas intosh, the co-chair, tried to kiss Serena in the ladies' bathroom at the pink party last year.
Using that information would be crossing a line.
I wouldn't ask you to do that.
What if I was willing to cross that line? I want the party moved more than anyone, but it's not worth resorting to blackmail.
Yeah.
Y-you're probably right.
So, "Psycho" or "Silence of The Lambs"? All right, make the call.
Where are you guys heading? Nate told me what you said, but I got a call from my P.
I.
, and he thinks he may have found my mother.
It turns out she wasn't trying very hard to hide.
In fact, she-- she lives in Jersey, same name, right age.
I have an address for her.
I have to at least talk to her.
Have you figured out what you might say to this woman? Do you want me to come along? I know we've been on opposing teams for a while, but I've been through this.
Maybe I could be helpful.
Actually Yeah.
I'd appreciate that.
I really hope it's my mom, Chuck.
Me, too.
Louis is going to store his suitcase in Blaine trump's Butler's pantry.
When Lucien arrives, you and I will rendez-vous there.
Okay, I need to get going.
You clear on the plan? Uh, yeah, I think I'll be fine once I figure out what a Butler's pantry is.
You're a cater waiter.
You know exactly what a Butler's pantry is.
Where is my cell phone? O.
M.
G.
They moved the pink party.
Who moves a party? It's not who that should concern you.
It's where--lily's.
So that's it, then, right? No.
The plan is still on.
In front of my dad, lily, Serena? Not in front of-- under the nose of.
We just need to be careful.
I'm gonna call Louis and tell him it's a go.
Meet you there.
Screw this up, it's your head.
Sorry, lonely boy, but it looks like this is going to be a "surrender the pink" party for you.
Lily.
Hi.
Check out the diamonds on that lady.
They're almost as big as my face.
A gift from her husband-- "sorry I slept with the au pair" earrings.
Have you seen Dan and Blair? No, and what do we do when they get here? It's not like they're gonna be holding hands in front of everyone.
Oh, the thrill of a secret affair is the sneaking around.
Trust me, they won't be able to resist slipping away for a moment together.
And when we see them slip away? You follow them, record what you see, and send it to "Gossip Girl.
" Their secret ends tonight.
Just make sure to text me once Lucien arrives.
Of course.
Thank you for this, Blair.
I just wish you didn't have to go to these lengths for me to stay.
It is saying a lot that I have to kiss Dan Humphrey to protect you.
You're going to kiss him? Don't worry.
He's just a friend.
I'll go up first.
I can't believe the ladies agreed to move the party.
After the frosty treatment I got from Anne this afternoon, I was sure it was just me and my ankle monitor until fall.
I can't believe we pulled this off.
Thank you so much for helping.
Oh, no, don't thank me.
Thank bubbles.
As if we'd want to be associated with a criminal.
She's an embarrassment.
We all agreed she's not to be in any photos from the event.
Okay, Blair, is it Jason Simos? He's my boyfriend, Jessica.
A handy at greenhouse doesn't make him your boyfriend.
Maybe Serena knows who Blair's secret boyfriend is.
No, but the curiosity is killing me.
Okay, I'll tell you.
Not you.
Scatter.
I can't wait to see the look on their faces when they find out it's the Prince.
You are not to breathe a word of this.
Normally, you'd have to sign a nondisclosure agreement.
I'm only grandfathering you in because of Serena.
That him right over there? Don't understand why you guys are ignoring each other.
That's because you're from Florida.
Oh, hey, it's Dan.
With a really nice tie, too.
Blair, did you know he was coming? I'm sorry.
I stopped listening as soon as I heard the word "Dan.
" Excuse me.
I can't believe it.
She just lied to my face, even after I gave her the opportunity to tell me.
It's not like I'm dating Dan or wanna get back together with him, but the fact th the two of them have been hiding this from me, and she's supposed to be my best friend? It didn't seem like she was lying.
What if she really is with the Prince? Then she won't mind it if you flirt with Dan.
Maybe this was a mistake.
Look, if you're not ready, we don't have to do this.
We can leave right now.
I'll handle it from here, okay? You jump in when you're ready.
Excuse me.
Hi.
May I take your order? Actually, we're here to see you.
Is your name Avery Thorpe? I'm sorry.
Do I know you? That's what we're trying to find out.
My name is Raina, and I think you may be my--my mother.
I'm sorry, sweet heart, but that's not possible.
I know it's not easy to acknowledge these things when you're put on the spot.
If you don't wanna be bothered, we can go.
I've never had a child.
It's not that I didn't want one.
Just wasn't in God's plan.
I'm so sorry, but I'm not the woman you're looking for.
You were right.
It was a mistake to look.
And as far as I'm concerned, my mother is dead.
No, no, don't let Sarah Palin ruin it for you.
Alaska is amazing.
I don't know, but between "into the wild" and that Werner Herzog movie with the grizzly, I don't think it's for me.
Excuse me.
This is Dan Humphrey, Serena's ex-boyfriend, which makes him off-limits to you, and you should know better.
Certain people might see you, misunderstand, and think the two of you are here together.
I need to speak to you about your behavior, privately.
What do you do when cornered by a bear? Uh, go fetal.
Cover your neck.
For someone who's just a friend, you sure are good at choreographing reasons for us to kiss.
Oh, it's because I'm willing to suffer for love.
Whatever you say, just no getting hands-y.
Thank you.
Oh, Anne, there you are.
I just wanted to say thank you so much for having the party moved here so that I could attend.
Oh, please, lily.
At least I was quiet in my humiliation.
I didn't blackmail people and force them to come to my home.
She had nothing to do with it, Anne.
It's all my doing.
I have to say, I'm surprised.
I thought we were friends.
Why? You don't know how to be a friend.
You shut me out when I called off my divorce to the captain.
There's not a woman in this room who didn't take some pleasure in your downfall, myself included.
So enjoy the party, lily.
This will be your last.
Oh, and you may wanna adjust your dress.
Your monitor's showing.
I'm so sorry, lily.
Are you okay? When Lucien walked in to get the bag, I saw the look on his face.
He totally bought it.
You're very convincing.
Thanks, I guess.
Blair Waldorf and Dan Humphrey? This is even better than my parents' divorce.
Please tell me it's true.
Uh Yes, it's true.
Dan is my mystery date, and we couldn't be happier.
Now we have to find Serena and explain this.
Hey, what's all the commotion about? Everyone finally found out about Dan and Blair.
But it isn't true.
They're just putting on an act to protect me.
Maybe that's what she told you, but they've been secretly seeing each other for months.
You shouldn't be surprised.
She lied to you in Paris, too.
I'm sorry.
Serena, wait.
I can explain.
I'll be right back.
Uh-oh.
Lily may be wearing her dancing shoes, but it looks like she's about to make a run for it.
Hey, I'm headed over to Raina's.
I just don't want her to be alone tonight.
I know you disagree, but I think she should keep looking for her mom.
She looked.
It wasn't her.
Give it up already.
So the first lead didn't pan out.
She has to stop.
Russell's parting gift to me was a story about my father.
You remember how I told you my dad was responsible for that fire in his old building? Russell owned it, too.
They were partners.
He says his wife was there that night, and she died in the fire.
How do you know he's even telling the truth? I don't, but today when that woman wasn't Raina's mother, I realized how desperately I wanted her to be.
So maybe I do believe it.
What are you gonna do? Try to find out the truth.
Serena, that video wasn't real.
I mean, we did--we did kiss, but it was staged.
Okay, even if I did believe you, what about the other time you guys kissed? Was that for Louis, too? Uh it meant nothing.
It was like kissing my brother, I just mean, we really wanna be with Chuck.
I don't understand.
How did you end up in a kiss in the first place--any kiss? We both were alone in the city over Christmas break.
And we ran into each other at the movies.
And then it kept happening after the break, only we started making plans to meet.
And even worse, enjoying it.
But you guys are my two closest friends.
Why couldn't you just tell me that? I was hoping it would go away.
I was humiliated, which is why we kissed.
To make sure nothing else was going on to complicate us or--or hurt you.
And? Biggest regret of my life.
I mean, that's a--come on.
That's a little bit an overstatement, but, yeah, it was not a good kiss.
So you guys have been lying to me and sneaking around for months so that you can hang out as friends? Exactly.
Friends.
Yeah, I swear.
Just--yeah, friends.
Well, I'm really glad you two found each other because you sure lost me.
I have to go.
I'm really sorry, S.
I guess I was in denial.
I didn't want to admit that I'd begun to understand e Humphrey appeal.
The only appeal Dan ever had to you was that he was mine.
You would see it that way, because it's always about you, isn't it? I'm sorry to break it to you, but Dan and I have a real connection.
We did things like visit the DIA and debate Chabrol versus Rohmer-- things that we could never do with you.
Yeah, I'm--I'm sure you and Dan had a really deep connection, that is until a Prince came along.
Of course, because that would be an even bigger threat to you.
What's that supposed to mean? You prefer when you are the one in the spotlight, but it's my turn now.
You can have a taste of what it's like to be in my shadow for once.
Now if you'll excuse me, my Prince awaits.
Lily Humphrey? Ma'am, you're violating the terms of your incarceration by being down here.
Ah, there you are.
It took you long enough.
I'm sorry? My apartment is teeming with women throwing back champagne cocktails and toasting my misfortune.
Honestly, it's worth risking an orange jumpsuit not to have to face another Botox bitch in a pink cocktail dress.
This is my way of saying could you please do me a favor? I'm here to arrest you.
Yes, well, there was some confusion about the perimeter-- whether the alarm was for the apartment or the building.
In the meantime, there have been horrible noise complaints from the neighbors.
I really think we should do something about that.
Hey.
Have you seen Louis? Ah, the Prince.
I can't find him anywhere.
I don't know who that is.
Have you seen my mother? Hey! All right, everybody.
The party is over.
Time to grab your Judith Leibers, ladies.
Looks like the Upper East Side's smoothest criminal has just given you the boot.
I am so sorry about tonight.
Don't be.
First of all, it was so sweet of you to move the party for me.
And I needed to hear those things that Anne said.
The fact is, maybe I could use a little time to reflect on my actions and what got me here.
There is nothing more appealing to me than staying home with you, watching a hundred movies and never seeing those women again.
Well, good, because I can promise you that's what we'll do for at least the next nine months.
Or six, for good behavior.
I totally understand if you don't want to see me, but I just wanted to tell you in person how sorry I am for recording you.
It was probably for the best.
I saw the kiss.
I think you really like her.
Yeah, you might be right.
I've been trying to convince myself that I could handle being friends with her, but I realize tonight that I can't.
I know from experience what it's like to watch from the outside as someone else walks away with the person you want.
Yeah, I just never thought that the person I want would be Blair Waldorf.
Neither did Serena.
She just thought some girl named Vanessa was messing with her.
Wait.
Vanessa told her about the kiss? Not Chuck? She left her a message, saying she overheard you and Blair talking about it? All right.
I've taken up enough of your time tonight.
So thanks for hearing me out.
No, actually, you know what? Hold on.
Do you, uh Did you wanna stay? Thanks for coming back for me.
I just stood up in front of everyone who matters in New York society and said I was dating Dan Humphrey.
I committed social suicide for you.
But Serena told me you've been having an affair with him.
She misunderstood.
We've been friends.
That's all.
You have to believe me.
You're the only man in my life now, the only man I want there, anyway.
I believe you.
You do? But being together means going against my family, and if I'm going to take a stand, I need to know for certain that you feel as I do.
I do.
Are you ready to go public, my family be damned? I'm ready if you are.
There they are! You can never really know someone until you walk a mile in their shoes.
Salut, Jean Michel.
It's Serena Van Der Woodsen from Paris last summer.
I was with Blair and Louis tonight, and it made me think about you, wanna call you and catch up, and, you know, see what's going on in your life and Louis'.
At first, it might not seem like the most natural fit What's in there? That used to be my sister's room and then it was a nursery, then it was Vanessa's room, and now it is my office.
It's a pretty versatile living space.
Uh, you know, check it out if you want, but I gotta get this.
Hi.
I figured if you were beat, we could just hang here.
Actually, I was planning on standing you up.
I know you told Serena about the kiss with Blair.
I was gonna tell you tonight to explain why I left the message.
I wasn't trying to hurt you.
I honestly thought something must be very wrong if you were kissing Blair Waldorf.
And since you weren't talking to me, I thought you might listen to Serena.
Vanessa, I know we've been friends since we were little, and we both like pierogies, and my dad really misses you, but just to be clear, so there's no misunderstanding down the road, we are not friends anymore.
Is everything okay? Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
But walk around in those shoes long enough, and you'll discover you just might like it.
Your dad gave me these security tapes after the kinberg building burned down and asked me to lock them away.
This one's from 8:00 P.
M.
the night of the fire.
What's on it? Bart, having an argument with a woman--Avery thorpe.
Then Avery goes into the building alone, and Bart hurries away.
Okay.
So? Moments later, the building goes up in flames, and Avery thorpe is never heard from again.
Just don't get too comfortable, kids, because you never know when the other shoe is going to drop.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Gossip girl, your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manthattan's elite.
Serena? The video isn't real, we did kissed, but - But it was "stage".
What about the other times you guys kissed? - Was that for louis too? - It meant nothing.
I'm really glad you found each other, because you sure lost me.
Wait.
Vanessa told her about the kiss, not chuck? Just to be clear, we are not friends anymore.
All i know about my mom is that her name is avery thorpe.
Do you think this will be enough for the private investigator To find her? This one is from 8:00 p.
M.
The night of the fire.
What's on it? Bart having an argument with a woman-Avery thorpe.
Moments later, the building goes up in flames, And avery thorpe is never heard from again.
But being together means going against my family.
If i'm going to take a stand, i need to know for certain That you feel as i do.
I do.
Mom, i'm sorry to wake you, but i have some news.
Once upon a time in the land called upper east, A beautiful girl met a beast.
Andrew, i was thinking, that video is circumstantial at best.
My father may have been a coldhearted businessman, But he wasn't a cold-Blooded murderer.
There's no proof the fire was intentional.
Let's just drop it.
Sorry i ever asked.
Thanks.
But while the beast locked himself in a tower of ennui, The girl found herself a prince.
His name louis! Oh! No, no way.
I-I-I will defend new york city to the death, But you cannot seriously say you prefer the met to the louvre.
But i do.
I will trade all the delacroix and davids For just an hour in front of that kiefer on the second floor.
Our first disagreement.
But, um, i must be off.
No.
Oh, i won't let you go.

  Blair, it's 2
0 p.
M.
I've been here since yesterday.
And as amazing as last night was, i need to talk to the ambassador.
It will just be a few hours.
A few hours is too long.
We're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon together.
And later we'll have tea in my salon at the consulate.
There's something i want to talk to you about.
Well, can we talk about it now? And bonjour.
Hey, serena.
I thought you were sleeping at your mother's house.

  I did, and as it's 2
0, i started my day several hours ago.
Sorry i interrupted.
Actually, i must be going.
I will see you later.
Je t'adore.
Oh.
If you'll excuse me, There's a tart in my room i'd rather attend to.
Blair, this fight between us has gotten a little out of hand, So why don't i be the mature one and admit that i may have Overreacted about you and dan? Really? Yeah, so let's just put this all behind us So we can gush about louis already.
Oh, yes! Thank goodness, because all this elation was Nearly meaningless without being able to talk to you about it.
Louis is fantastique.
We share all our secrets and- And our dreams for the future- How he plans to run his kingdom, how i plan to run mine.
Sounds like everything you've ever wanted.
I'm in, s.
I'm totally in.
I think he's gonna ask me To spend the summer with him in monaco.
I worry she moving too fast.
Ugh.
Dorota, everyone knows that with princes, Things escalate quickly.
It's genetic.
After all, prince charming knew he loved cinderella As soon as he saw her preternaturally tiny feet.
And what about louis' parents? After the lengths he went to to hide your date last week, How are they taking all the press coverage about him dating an american? Prince albert has no legitimate children, So as his first male nephew, louis is next in line to the throne.
I'm sure his parents have their heart set On an empire-Expanding union with a hapless hapsburg.
But luckily they're in botswana.
They won't be back for two weeks, during which time, The european media will fall in love with me and win the commoners to my cause.
Yesterday she watch monaco play p.
S.
G.
At actual sports bar.
Ah.
This afternoon, we're going to church so i can be photographed being pious.
I must find my pillbox hat.
Je suis trs heureuse.
You so deserve it.
Too bad that around here, happy endings often lack, So if i were b.
, i'd watch my back.
Well, hello, jeeves.
We're watching "downton abbey.
" Edwardian social dramas apparently demand crumpets.
Nice to see she's finally accepting this whole house arrest thing.
Between you and me, no matter how much they love each other, No two people should spend 24/7 together.
But my time as a drawing room butler might be quickly coming to an end.
This guy from my old label was wondering If i was into producing a record For a new indie band he just signed, so i don't know.
You don't know what? That sounds like an amazing opportunity.
It does, doesn't it? I mean, i-I don't need to be back onstage, But i do miss the music world.
So, uh, you'll understand if i can't hang out.
Oh, i'm here picking up charlie anyway.
Charlie? Huh.
You guys have been Spending a lot of time together lately.
What? Dad, don't worry.
We are just friends.
Just be careful.
Dan, hi.
Good luck.
I'll see you later.
It's 4:00.
Smoking jacket hour, man.
Why are you still in your robe? Is everything okay? Peachy.
Oh, come on, chuck.
I know you've seen the papers.
Blair's dating that prince guy.
Can't be easy.
Nathaniel, i wish my problems Were as simple as blair's royal fling.
Have you heard from andrew? Is there proof that what russell said about your dad is true? Nothing concrete.
Well, that's better than the opposite, right? 'Cause raina's decided she wants to keep looking for her mother.
I'd really rather she didn't.
Come on, chuck.
It's important to her, And me avoiding the subject is starting to come between us.
Nate, raina can't go digging into the past.
As my friend, i need you to help me get this done.
I'll do my best.
Hey, don't worry.
Blair's not gonna end up with this guy.
We all know it.
Your anthropology class is so cool.
It's just so interesting how the!Kung tribe Treated their women as hunting heroes while the men, they just i'm-I'm babbling, aren't i? No.
Well, yeah, you are, But enthusiasm is great.
Sorry.
It's just, the classes i took at school were boring and full of meatheads.
That seminar was fascinating.
The kids were cool.
So thank you for inviting me.
Uh, sure.
You're welcome.
You wanna split a cab? Uh, no, i'm gonna hang around here.
I'm gonna look for books on the.
.
!Kung tribe.
All right.
I'll see you later.
Do you think i made a good impression On the monsignor today? You were irresistible.
He's probably second-Guessing his vows right now.
But, blair, i don't want you to continue this constant charade For my parents.
I want you to be you.
And i want to be with you.
The threat of your parents' disapproval is The only dark cloud on what has been an otherwise perfect day.
They shouldn't worry you, certainly not while they're on a safari.
But i do need to tell you something.
I - I didn't tell you before Because i didn't wanna scare you away.
It-It may be too much.
Too much is just the right amount.
Is it something i need a bikini for? Louis.
Qu'est que tu fais? Maman? What-What are you uh, your royal highness, hello.
I'm blair waldorf.
What are you thinking? Out day and night with an american, getting your picture taken? Uh, i-I can explain.
It is unacceptable in any case, Especially for a young man who is about to be married.
Blair, please.
Please, let me explain.
I should have known not to believe.
And in all princess tales, an evil queen does appear.
I found them.
Thank you so much for notifying me of this fiasco.
You're most welcome.
But it turns out, The queen's helper is the one b.
Should fear.
Maybe you hear wrong.
Maybe she say "carried.
" Maybe he getting carried.
That doesn't even make sense.
I trusted him.
I allowed myself to feel things for him That i've only felt for you-Know-Who, and he lied.
A big, terrible, upper east-Sized lie.
Where he staying? Royal or no, vanya go over there, do some damage, eastern european style.
Maybe i do damage myself.
Seriously? You think flowers make up for the fact that you're engaged? I'm not engaged yet.
This is what i wanted to tell you.
The royal court feels i should be married Before taking my rightful place as albert's heir.
What? Well, that's outdated and old-Fashioned And just idiotic.
Well, so is monarchy, But it's important to my family.
And they're important to me, So how long till you have to choose? To punish me for publicly dating you? Maman has flown in her top ten candidates For a cocktail party tomorrow, and they're demanding i choose.
So by tomorrow night, you'll be engaged to someone else.
I've been to a million balls and ski trips With the women who will be there tomorrow night.
But i've never connected to any of them Like i have to you.
What are you saying? That i want you to be on my mother's list, too.
And i-If i was chosen? We could court while wearing rings.
Well, in real life, It's far too soon to consider that type of thing, But in fairy tales just tell this maiden what she has to do to get to the ball.
I told my mother i'd agree to go to her party If she agreed to meet you.
She's waiting for you back at the salon.
If she approves, all you have to do is impress the royal court tomorrow.
Well, then i promise to wow the tiara right off her head.
Wow, b.
, courting with rings.
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't be nervous.
The princess will fall in love with you Just like everyone else.
Bye.
I recognize that happiness.
You sound like jenny after she found out That one of her minions got a date with an astor.
Next day, said minion found gum in her hair.
What's going on with you and blair? Mm, i may have let louis' mother know about him and blair.
But somehow it worked out to her favor.
Apparently, louis needs to get married, And-And blair's weaseling her way onto a throne of her own Unless i stop it.
Serena, she's your best friend.
I know she crossed sacred territory When she kissed dan, but destroying this for her Seems kinda cruel.
Oh, come on.
We both know that if i kissed chuck, i wouldn't Even be able to be having this conversation right now.
A - And i'm doing louis a favor anyway.
His future is on the line here, and blair is just playing princess.
So this is all for the benefit of the good people of the principality of monaco? Come on.
Acting like blair never works for anybody except blair.
And besides, blair has so many skeletons.
I highly doubt that louis' mother is gonna Find her an acceptable princess-In-Training.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
I have to go.
She says sneakily.
Oh, looks like b.
Is in for some hair gum of her own.
As so even though the division's getting tougher and tougher, The mets-They actually have a chance this year.
We gotta go.
The infield fly rule's so much easier to explain in person.
Nate, what's going on? You surprise me with this dinner, And all you talk about is sports? What? The season just started.
Spring fever is an actual disease, you know? It feels like ever since that failed attempt To meet my mother, you've been avoiding talking about it-Her.
I got to admit, i didn't think you'd scare so easy.
Raina, i didn't mean look, i'm not scared, okay? I wanna be supportive.
Then what is it? It's just i think some things are better left un-Found.
You know? And i don't want you to get hurt.
My mother is a part of who i am.
I need to know why she left, What happened to her.
So i don't need you Or anyone else trying to protect me from the truth.
Raina, i - Thank you for dinner, nate, But i have some work i need to catch up on back at the office.
Dad, why are you dressed like the fonz? It's my lucky tour jacket.
I take it lunch with the label went well? Yeah.
They want me to have panic- Name of the band, also what's gripping my insides- Over for dinner tomorrow.
And you wanna be the, uh, cool rocker guy.
Come on.
I was the cool rocker guy.
Yeah, but now the penthouse, the art, The millionairess wife under house arrest doesn't exactly scream street cred.
Oh, i wouldn't have put it that way, but panic is the real deal.
So invite 'em to the loft tomorrow.
You can, uh, You can keep it casual, impress 'em with your gold records.
Yeah, that's a great idea.
Will you guys come? Yeah, we could invite, uh, charlie, too.
No, no, not charlie.
No.
You were right, dad.
I think she might have a little crush.
I knew it.
Yeah, but i didn't lead her on, though.
I swear.
Just promise me the next time you see her, you'll be clear about your feelings.
She lives under my roof, and i'm responsible for her.
She texted me she'll be home soon.
And i promise i will talk to her soon as i get a chance, But i have a study group i gotta get to.
Guys, don't worry.
It's fine.
"How to go from just friends to boyfriend?" Interesting.
Charlie, hi.
We haven't formally met.
I'm vanessa.
Oh, right.
Dan's former b.
F.
F.
Who ratted out the blair kiss to serena.
What do you want? I realize that lately I've exposed more secrets than julian assange, But i'm leaving soon.
I got a scholarship to study abroad, So come the end of this semester, i'll be out Of everyone's hair.
Look, even if he hates me right now, Dan's been my best friend since third grade, And i can't leave unless i know he's okay.
I'll make sure he takes his vitamins.
Let me help you.
I can't leave dan in the hands of serena, Or even worse, blair waldorf.
I just i want dan to be with a girl Who's not gonna corrupt his soul, and- And trust me, i can give you better advice than that book.
With albert's illegitimate children, ernst's thai mistress, And stephanie's stint in the circus, i understand your apprehension About a dark horse from the states, But i can assure you that the waldorfs are as prestigious A family as america has, and i would never bring ignominy to louis.
Oh, really? Seems to me that scandal is your middle name.
You blackmail teachers, bully underclassmen, A pregnancy scare? You dated lord marcus while he was sleeping With his stepmother.
Then you were traded by chuck bass- Whose name precedes him - For a hotel.
I think this meeting is over.
No, princess, please let me explain.
It's not necessary, ms.
Waldorf.
I - I've had a past, But all my wrongdoings, all my secrets are right there in front of you.
"Gossip girl" has been chronicling my mistakes Since i was 14.
Can you really say that about the other girls Invited to the party tomorrow? No, but i doubt that any of them Have performed in a burlesque club.
Louis knows all about my past.
I've grown.
I've changed.
I can be the next grace kelly.
What are you doing here? I told you i'm done.
I know, but i found this.
I think it was in the box with all the tapes.
Fell out in my car.
It's dated the day before the fire.
Read it.
"You know how much you mean to me, "but i can't do this anymore.
I'm so sorry.
Avery.
" My father and avery thorpe were having an affair.
And she was gonna leave him, go back to russell.
That's your motive.
The tapes show opportunity, and we already know That bart admitted he was responsible for the fire, so well, at least you can't hang a dead man.
I'm sorry, chuck.
I know you didn't want your father to be guilty, But maybe now you can move on.
What was andrew tyler doing here? You okay? Nothing a bottle of blue and the dancers from "spider-Man" can't fix.
Andrew and i were just wrapping things up.
How did your dinner with raina go? Oh, not well.
She basically walked out on me.
Sorry, man, but she is dead set on looking for her mother.
Well, hopefully she doesn't find anything, Gives up on her own.
Or she finds her mom, and you'll know Once and for all you have nothing to worry about.
Right.
Nothing to worry about.
Poor chuck.
When you asked bart about the fire, No wonder an affair was something he chose not to remember.
And we know albert is set to marry in july, call her "fishstock.
" Not nice.
If she is there with prince, you need to curtsy to her.
If she there alone, no curtsy.
If you get engaged to louis, Then she curtsy only if she not there with sovereign, But if she there with her prince and you there with yours, I am no sure, so try and avoid her.
Okay.
Got it.
What's next? History.
I-I dig a little dirt, too.
Make us flash cards.
Louis, what are you doing here? In this fairy tale, i like to play both prince And fairy godfather.
For tonight.
But even if you wore a sack, You'd be the most enchanting one there.
This prince growing on me by minute.
Uh, dan.
What are you doing here? My dad just asked me to drop off his lucky doc martens.
Ah.
Cool.
What are you doing today? Because i was thinking about trying those pierogies That you're always talking about, And according to bing, there is a really great place in queens.
Look, charlie, we-We should talk.
Okay.
Sure.
Yeah, what's up? I really like you.
I do.
I - I mean, you're smart and you're cool, kind of a spaz in a great way.
Thank you? But i'm just, uh yeah, i-I'm not looking for a relationship right now.
No kidding? You're barely over the blair weirdness, Never mind for serena to be as mad as she was About the kiss.
Um, i'm not thinking of anything but friends.
Okay.
Great.
That's, uh, that's a relief.
You, serena, and eric are the only people i know here, So i'm sorry if i have been coming on too strong.
I'll tone it down a notch.
No don't.
I mean, seriously.
I'm sorry i misinterpreted.
Look, uh, my dad is hosting Some business clients tonight at the loft.
Eric will be coming.
It'll be low-Key.
Like, pizza, music.
Sound like fun? You in? Uh, you know, it's that or "masterpiece theatre" With lily again, so yeah, i'm in.
But you have to let me help out.
I can make homemade pizza.
Are-Are you sure? I mean, i wouldn't want to put you out.
No, it's no trouble.
Just give me the keys.
I'll cook at the loft.
Okay.
All right.
I just gotta go drop these boots off.
Yeah.
Good to see you survived the night.
Maybe now you can actually talk about what we're gonna do here.
Do? About what? Raina.
She needs to know about her mother.
Nathaniel.
I was thinking maybe we could tell her together And show her the letter, then - Nate, are you out of your mind? Between the videotape you told me about And the letter from her mom, chuck, i can't let her Get her hopes up.
She'll spend her whole life Searching for someone she'll never find.
Don't say anything.
What am i supposed to do Every time she brings up her mother? Lie.
I don't know.
You figure it out, or just stop seeing her.
Chuck, i actually like this girl, man.
What's wrong with you, huh? You don't even know how to be in a relationship.
Blair's lucky she escaped you.
Hey! Leave blair out of this.
No one understands what we have.
Yeah, no one understands because it's not normal.
She's better off with the french guy.
You can't seriously mean that.
I saw on "gossip girl" That she's going to some party tonight at the consulate.
Who cares? She always goes to parties.
This one's hosted by his family.
Apparently he needs to get engaged.
Monaco's independence day.
November 19th.
Patron saint.
Sainte dvote.
Serena! There you are.
Did you see the dress louis got me? Ah, it's official.
We should send out change of address cards, because i'm moving to cloud nine.
Ah, louis is incredible.
With him by my side, i can actually be a powerful woman.
Forget running anne archibald's charity.
I'm gonna be negotiating peace in the sudan.
You really are happy, aren't you? Which is why tonight has to go perfectly.
Will you come with me? Tonight? Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Oh, yay.
You're the best friend a girl could have.
And just think maybe one day soon, you'll be my maid of honor, too.
I would be honored.
I don't have my keys, but charlie's been inside cooking all day.
Yeah, even if her food tastes like those cookies she made, Be nice.
Why? Cookies not good? Surprise! Arthur, bring the car around.
We got a party to crash.
Wonder if chuck bass is about to go from down and out To down on one knee.
Nothing like using a rock to get out of a hard place.
Princess maha galyani from thailand.
Princess lucie of bavaria.
Marchesa francesca mancini.
Dorota's been quizzing me all day.
I'm completely up to speed on my competition.
In it to win it, going big or going home.
Relax, b.
You don't need sports metaphors.
You've been preparing for this your entire life.
Now come on.
Let's go out there and show these people What a real princess looks like, Because in this town, you are royalty.
Thank you, s.
I couldn't do it without you by my side.
Ms.
Blair waldorf from manhattan.
I dropped lily's name and credit card number, And per se agreed to cater.
It got a 28 in zagat.
I, uh, i thought you were making pizza.
Well, who needs pizza when you have coq au vin? Yeah, charlie, it's lovely.
Okay, caviar and pt should be out soon.
I just need to check one thing with the sommelier.
Ah, there's a sommelier! Okay, your fonzie jacket Was a better idea than this.
Dad, i'm so sorry.
I had no idea that she would do any of this.
It's fine.
I just don't want charlie to think she's ruined anything.
You know, i'll head panic off downstairs, tell them there's Been a change of plans and take 'em out to eat.
Great, okay, and we'll just tell them that the band canceled.
Yeah, we'll take her to a movie or something.
Okay.
Hey, where are you going? Uh, actually, um - The band had a change of plans.
The band? I thought we were entertaining business associates.
I totally messed everything up, didn't i? I can't believe this.
I ruined everything.
I was only doing what vanessa told me to do.
Wait - Vanessa? Oh, but you have to adore monte carlo.
Nelson piquet likened racing around the course To riding a bicycle in his living room.
Oh, countess alexia, so lovely to meet you.
And how's your uncle, the viscount? I heard he gave up his chair at the university Over that unfortunate scandal with a student.
I guess not everyone likes oral exams.
Contessa gina, lovely to meet you in person.
Perhaps my mother finding out about us Was actually a blessing in disguise.
All my life, I thought i'd be married to someone i didn't love.
Maybe, just maybe, that nightmare will turn into my dream.
Chuck, what are you doing here? I need to see blair.
You're drunk.
Just go home, please.
I beg of you, don't ruin this for her.
I have something she needs to hear.
It's important.
Excuse me.
What are you doing here? I need to ask you something.
Get out of here.
This is not the time nor place for a scene.
Your highness, tell me again about your a capella club at oxford.
I get you don't wanna talk to me, But hiding out in your office seems a little extreme.
I'm not hiding.
I'm working.
Why? You have concerns About the mets bullpen you need to mull over? You're right.
I've been avoiding talking to you About your mother.
I was trying to protect someone, okay? I was wrong.
I don't understand.
-Protect someone? -Nate do you know something? You look familiar.
Didn't you, me, and a stewardess Get to know each other intimately over lithuania? Excuse me.
I am princess sophie grimaldi of monaco.
Ah, yes, blair's future mother-In-Law.
There's no surprise she went for a prince.
Marie antoinette was one of her favorite roles to play.
Of course, i was always eating her cake.
How dare you.
And you are i'm chuck bass, the love of her life.
Anyone else is just a waste of time.
Chuck, go home.
Match, blair.
You proved you can score a prince.
Okay, i admit.
You made me jealous.
Now let's go back to my place so you can collect your prize.
Stop this.
You're embarrassing me.
What? It's not me who's disrespecting these fine people.
It's you, Pretending you're going to marry this french phony.
It's a joke.
Chuck, no one's laughing.
Don't do this.
Come here.
Stop it! This is enough! No, stop! Security! Chuck, go home.
This is enough.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Tell your prince where your heart truly lies.
Tell him.
Tell me.
Sir.
Your royal highness, i'm so, so ashamed And sorry if my friends and i have caused any trouble.
Sorry.
Spotted-A prince torn Between choosing his kingdom or his queen.
End it.
Now.
In all my years of public humiliation, which-Let's face it- Are many, That was the absolute worst.
Well, maybe louis will come around.
Perhaps, but his mother never will, and who can blame her? I should have known my past with chuck would come back to haunt me.
You're probably gonna hate me for saying this, But as drunk and inappropriate as chuck was, I still felt a little bad for him.
What? Why? I don't know.
I guess i just always thought Your prince was right here with his empire in manhattan.
Wait.
After what you witnessed tonight, -You're taking his side? -No.
And don't think i don't know it was you That sent princess sophie that scrapbook from "gossip girl.
" I assumed it was payback for dan, But maybe you were defending chuck, too.
Blair, i feel awful.
Louis made me happy.
Happy.
Do you know the last time i felt joy? Chuck had brought me into his darkness for so long, I'd forgotten what that felt like.
And with all your dan issues, It's obvious you think your romantic fate was sealed In the 11th grade, but i'm growing up.
I wanted something different.
I wanted louis.
All my life, i thought my mother didn't love me.
Raina, i'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
There was insurance money - A lot of it.
Bart probably paid your father off Not to say anything to the police, But he should have told you years ago.
He didn't tell me because he knew the truth Was worth than the fiction.
This is too unbearable.
But at least i understand Why my father was so intent on crushing bass industries.
Raina, look, i know you're going through a lot, okay, but- Chuck-He's just like his father.
He lied to me.
He lied to you, And he tried to cover up the truth about my mother.
Hey, he's had to deal with all this, too, you know- Don't you dare defend him, nate.
I'm not.
If you wanna remain friends with him, Then you're gonna have to get out of here now.
I mean it.
Get out.
And vanessa said the loft Wasn't a suitable place to entertain business people, So she suggested that i, uh- You throw a michelin star dinner? I mean, that must've taken a lot of work.
It took all day.
I just wanted it to be perfect.
But why? Why'd you do that? I think you know.
Vanessa said if i helped rufus, uh, it'd help me get you, too.
And now i'm not only the loser who's responsible For ruining your dad's job possibility, I'm also the loser who lied to you about liking you as a friend.
Hmm, well, sounds like you've learned your first lesson Of being an upper east sider.
I think it's time for your second lesson.
Face your enemies.
You ready for your first showdown? If it's okay with you, i'd like to talk to vanessa alone.
If i'm gonna survive in this world, i gotta do it on my own, right? We'll meet at the loft when you're done with vanessa, Maybe have some caviar and pt? I get it, louis.
Tonight was a disaster.
You can save your sweet, remorseful breakup.
I know.
I overheard your conversation with serena, And i want you to choose joy in your life.
More than that, i want to be the one who gives you joy.
Your family is never going to approve of me.
Not now.
Forget them.
I've spent my whole life doing what they wanted- Being who they groomed me to be.
But if you're willing to fight for your happiness, Then i'm willing to fight for mine.
I bought this to give to you After you had the royal court's approval.
But without it, it means even more.
Uh i've seen all the movies, louis.
If you don't get engaged to someone they want, Then they'll find a way to make sure You never ascend to the throne.
There's no point in being the head of state If it means i can't follow my heart.
Blair will you marry me? Hey.
How's charlie? Oh, she's, uh, she's fine.
She felt terrible, but turns out it wasn't her fault.
It's a-It's a long story.
How'd it go with the band? Well, you're looking at panic's next producer.
What? That's great! Uh, what'd you do? Well, i did what i should have done in the first place- Talked about music.
Please tell me this means that lily can now donate That leather jacket to charity.
You kidding? I'm saving that for the rock and roll hall of fame Or the smithsonian, right next to fonzie's actual jacket.
Hey.
I thought i was meeting dan.
He doesn't wanna see you.
Why? What happened tonight? Because of you, i got per se to cater, Rented crystal.
Needless to say, it didn't work out.
I was humiliated.
What are you talking about? I told you to have a nice, relaxed, low-Key night.
Yeah.
That's not what he thinks.
He's under the impression you tried to sabotage me.
Why would you do that? I was trying to help you get dan.
And you have.
I've read "gossip girl" enough to know That dan can't resist a damsel in distress, And you happen to make a perfect villain.
Come on, vanessa.
If you actually knew how to get dan, You wouldn't be running away to study abroad.
Don't worry, though.
I'll take good care of him while you're gone.
You came.
How could you do that to me, chuck? I'm sorry i ruined your shot at being a princess.
But let's face it.
You were never gonna go through with it.
Chuck.
I need you, blair, Like i never have before.
Everything i believed about my father, everything i thought i wanted to be, What i needed to be for him - It was all based on lies.
The only thing that's ever been real is me and you.
And you know that.
That's why you came back to me.
Louis asked me to marry him.
You'll never marry anyone else.
You're mine.
I wanted to be.
I wanted it so badly, but not anymore.
You're mine, blair.
Stop it, chuck! I said it's over.
Once upon a time in the land of upper east, a beautiful girl fled from a beast.
Hey, raina, it's me.
Listen, you were right about chuck.
I choose you.
Call me.
His closest friends began to retreat no, you don't know me, but my father, russell thorpe, Had planned on getting in touch with you.
It's about chuck, your nephew.
I'll explain it all in person.
I look forward to meeting you, too, jack.
While enemies marshaled to plan his defeat.
Across the river in lands far away, A mysterious young maiden was making her play.
And with the beast finally vanquished, Most tales-They would end with one happy princess and an excited best friend.
But in a land where the best castles come with a view of the park, it's important to remember mom? I'm sorry to wake you, but i have some news.
I'm engaged.
Now where most fairy tales end, ours merely starts.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, gossip girl.
Gossip girl here-- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Vanessa said if I helped Rufus, it'd help me get you.
He's under the impression you tried to sabotage me, and you happen to make a perfect villain.
My goal was to destroy Chuck.
My Uncle is my worst enemy.
Chuck tried to cover up the truth about my mother.
This one is from 8:00 P.
M.
the night of the fire.
What's on it? Bart having an argument with a woman-- Avery thorpe.
My father and Avery thorpe were having an affair.
I'll explain it all in person.
I look forward to meeting with you, too, Jack.
Don't think I don't know it was you that sent princess Sophie that scrapbook from "Gossip Girl.
" Without the royal court's approval, it means even more.
Will you marry me? You'll never marry anyone else.
You're mine.
I said it's over.
No! Aah! Mom, I have some news.
I'm engaged.
You're not my dream anymore Good morning, sleepyheads.
Looks like "dream until your dreams come true" wasn't such a good idea after all.
So I thought I'd bring some luxury across the river.
Brooklyn needs it.
It's all bars, bakeries, and babies.
No hotel in sight.
Charles place.
You up to attend the ribbon cutting? No, thanks.
Still pissed I lied to raina about my father.
Yeah, well, it was a big lie Even for you.
That's why I'm stepping out from under his dark shadow and away from the Bass name.
Whatever you wanna call yourself or your hotel, you're still the same person.
And with everything going on, I still need my best friend by my side.
I saw what you did to Blair.
Going to stay with raina for a while.
If you walk out, don't be here when I get back.
Don't worry.
I'm already gone.
Really? You're trying me again? Does that seem like it's gonna work? You answered.
You're right.
My bad.
Wait.
I know you don't like me, but can you at least acknowledge that everything I told you was true? Your point? You didn't need to have your cousin make me look like a crazy, jealous bitch to Dan.
Oh, you don't need any help with that.
She said I manipulated her to ruin Rufus' business dinner.
You're telling me that innocent cousin Charlie came up with that by herself? I'm saying you probably did whatever she said you did.
If Charlie's fighting back, good for her.
She's learning.
Good-bye, Vanessa.
Mmm.
Green.
Yellow! That's 0-for-4.
Okay, let's try sour patch kids.
I thought we were gonna have breakfast.
This is breakfast.
When I was little, sour patch kids were pretty much my best friends-- them and books.
Books.
Oh, me, too.
What was, uh, what was your favorite? I could try to be cool and make something up, but if I were honest "Flowers in the attic.
" My copy literally fell apart.
Really? What was it that you loved most, uh, exactly? Was it the gripping tale of teen incest or just the general fine quality of the prose? Oh, my God.
I totally should have lied and said Fitzgerald.
I can tell he influences your writing, um, especially that story in "the new yorker.
" Um was that about Serena? Uh, yeah, yeah, that was back when I was on the outside, not getting my own personal invitation to the constance/st.
Jude's black tie alumni fund-raiser.
Yeah, it's, uh I wasn't gonna go, 'cause I wasn't exactly the most popular kid in high school, so why relive that, right? But then I thought, you know, maybe--maybe if you came with me, it'd be fun.
Yes! Are you kidding? Yes! Um Blair is having this little engagement toast beforehand, and she invited me.
I figured I-I should go, so you want to meet me there? I'd love to.
So here comes the future princess.
Now what does that make us, I wonder.
Well, as of now, nothing.
In choosing me, Louis gave up his succession rights.
Well, fortunately, we are here to throw you an engagement party, so maybe we can fix that.
Well, while this looks delicious, I thought we agreed on a champagne toast.
Oh, of course.
This Is the vitaminwater design competition with the c.
F.
D.
A.
Me and Joe zee and the vena cava girls-- we are the judges, and we will be picking the final t-shirt from a young designer to complete the collection.
We can be launching someone's career.
Well, let's keep our attention on my future, shall we? I really want the princess to understand that Louis can have me and his rightful title.
Not to worry.
I happen to be an expert mediator.
Serena, did lily get those dresses that I sent over? You know, the maxi ones from last year's collection? I'm on my way to spend the day with her, so I'll ask.
And be back in time for the engagement party, I hope? Or not.
I'd actually like to be engaged when it's over.
Blair, I'm sorry I sent those blasts to Louis' mother, but everything worked out great, so can we just enjoy it and move on, please? Like much else in your life, that apology was underwhelming.
Good to see you, Eleanor.
You must be Jack.
Thank you for getting here so quickly.
It was nothing.
Your father and I go way back, which won't stop me from inviting you to have is little chat someplace more comfortable-- your hotel room.
I see the Bass family resemblance.
So What's this about that old building my brother burned down? I just found out my mother was in it.
I didn't even know she was dead until recently.
But now that I do, I want the revenge my dad never got.
Chuchas proof that my mother's death wasn't an accident.
He's been covering it up ever since he found out.
While I love making my nephew suffer, what, besides entertainment, is in it for me? The reins of Bass industries.
You know all the right things to say, don't you? What the hl? Nate, I'm sure you know Jack.
Yes, unfortunately, I do, but why do you? I'll be in touch to discuss details.
Should've known you'd still be ding on my ney ew's leftovers.
You brought in Jack Bass? Is that panic's art? That looks great.
Yeah.
Hey, um, your mom called, and, uh, she was concerned that you were due for a refill on your medication and didn't get it.
Shoot.
I was so excited about going to the fund-raiser tonight with Dan that I forgot to pick it up on my way home.
I'll go right now.
I already did.
Uh, your mom told me that last time things went well, you stopped taking them.
And then they went from well to hell.
Trust me, I never want that to happen again.
Okay, neither do we.
You have nothing to worry about, unlike me who has no idea what I'm gonna wear tonight.
New York is always so gray, even in the spring.
And the angles everywhere-- they are so harsh.
I'll be happy to be back in Monaco.
The "Glenn ligon: America" exhibit at the Whitney is definitely worth the trip.
There's nothing gray or angular there, except the building.
I think I've had my fill of your city's ugliness for this trip.
Mother, please.
I'm sorry for the way Chuck behaved with the royal court.
He's out of my life for good, and you can rest assured that my family and friends are nothing like him most of the time.
I suppose.
I will see for myself this evening at your party.
And I was also thinking that we could go to my Alma mater's fund-raiser tonight afterwards.
Didn't one of Caroline's b*st*rd children go to that school? Or was it Albert? Blair, do you know? Uh I-I-I'm sorry.
I just remembered that I have to get my dress for tonight altered.
I lost weight in the whirlwind romance, so, um, would you mind if I take a rain check for tea? Of course.
We'll see you tonight.
Okay.
She's lying.
About losing weight? I had her followed.
If you are going to give up the throne for this girl, the least she can do is give up her bad habits for you.
The first place she went after you asked her to marry you? To see Chuck Bass.
Let's hope the only thing b.
Has in common with Marie antoinette is impeccable taste, or she just might lose her head before she gets her crown.
I can't believe how amazing these parties look.
Oh, that's the constance/ St.
jude's fund-raiser.
It's a shame we're missing it this year since my mom can't go.
Actually um Dan invited me.
Oh, that's--that's great.
Are you sure? You said that you weren't seeing him, and I can call right now and cancel if you want.
Don't be ridiculous.
Dan and I are barely even talking.
Um I've never been to a black tie affair before.
If only I had something to wear.
Your mom's been super generous, but I can't put a dress like that on her black card.
Wait.
What about your trust fund? You're over 18.
Why haven't you gotten it yet? Maybe grandma and my mom's issues are worse than we thought.
No, I bet that that's not it.
My mom and Cece have basically gone "celebrity rehab" on one another, and she's never held it against me and Eric.
Let me call and find out.
You're like my fairy godcousin.
I'll let you get started.
Yeah.
Well, look who finally came to her senses.
Concierge at the empire said that you were here.
Louis and I are still very much engaged.
Then why are you here with me? I'm risking my well-being to tell you your Uncle Jack is in town.
I saw him myself this afternoon.
Makes sense.
Like building your way to hurt me.
I just came to warn you so you could prepare for whatever it is Jack is planning.
And how will I ever prepare for what you're planning? I should go.
Can't be late for my engagement party.
Already so royal, sensitive to the suffering of her subjects.
You have no idea what I've been going through since that night.
Chuck Just be careful.
And all this time, I thought you hated Bart because of his sunny personality.
I see you've spoken with my daughter.
And apparently you haven't.
No.
She's holding on to some anger about this whole situation.
Can't say I blame her.
Doesn't mean I wanna do business with her.
Which is why you called me.
What raina's proposing suits me fine.
It's just, your daughter's history with Chuck, Nate Archibald crashing our meeting, looking like he just ran away from home-- the whole thing feels messy, juvenile.
I couldn't agree more.
What did you have in mind? My nephew is at the edge of a cliff again.
Nothing turns him upside down like losing Blair Waldorf.
All he needs is a push, and I'll have the men in lab coats waiting to catch him when he falls.
Let me know what I can do.
You can start by paying for drinks during which we'll discuss what else you'll be paying for.
Yeah, you know, there's one more thing.
I believe there's a box Chuck is protecting in his suite.
I'm guessing it's where Bart kept mementos, letters from my wife.
It would mean the world to me if I could have those things for myself.
I'll make sure you're well compensated.
I'll make sure you get a key.
Looks like someone got their trust fund.
Thank you for vouching for me.
I got a loan from the bank of Cece until my official checkbooks arrive.
I've also fallen in love with Nina ricci, or whoever designs her dresses.
Ooh, let me see.
Oh, shoot.
It's my mom.
I better get this.
I'll show you later? Of course.
Hi, mom.
I just got the most amazing dress for this fund-raiser at St.
jude's tonight with Dan.
Uh, with my trust fund.
No, don't be mad.
Everything's perfect.
I promise.
Nothing's wrong.
No, I'll talk to you later.
I don't think that's what the doctor had in mind when he said, "use as directed.
" How can you have an engagement party without the prince? Oh, right.
He's not one anymore.
I invited you to attend, not to speak.
Here, try the '91.
Did you know that princess Sophie is an avid ornithologist, just like me? I cannot concentrate on vintage with you droning on about insects.
My dear Ornithology is the study of birds, not insects.
Oh.
I'm Cyrus rose, Blair's stepfather, and this is my wife Eleanor.
Princes Sophie, welcome to our tasteful and appropriate home.
Thank you.
Now I'm a hugger.
Hope you don't mind.
Oh! Princess Sophie, I apologize for not greeting you properly.
Ou est Louis? He said he would meet me here.
This is good work.
I figure two weeks.
Excuse me.
Your highness, you'll forgive me if I'm too busy to bow.
I don't appreciate the sarcasm, or, for that matter, anything else about you.
Then we're equal.
Except I'm not pursuing your fiance.
I know Blair came here to see you.
Maybe your fiance is pursuing me.
I highly doubt that, after you humiliated her in front of the royal court.
So why don't you tell me what's going on? Shouldn't you be asking Blair that? I want the truth.
If you can't trust Blair to tell you the truth, you've got bigger problems than me.
All I'll say is get used to it.
Blair is nothing without her secrets.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a real foe to fight.
What did you do to your hand? It will heal with time, unlike you, who's facing a lifetime doubting Blair.
Hey.
What are you still doing here? Uh, bringing mom dinner.
She's in a bidding war for a vintage birkin on ebay and can't leave the computer.
But don't you have Blair's engagement toast? I know you both have your issues.
I can't force Blair to want me there.
But come on.
It's Blair.
She might have trouble saying it most of the time, but she loves you as much as she loves anybody.
Of course she wants you there.
Hey, sorry to barge in, but I'm thinking about going to Blair's party after all.
I just wanted to check that there's a dress in my closet.
No problem.
Ugh, this is terrible.
I can't even decide how to wear my hair.
Do your feet hurt after wearing heels all night? And does Dan dance? Do you prefer lipstick or lip gloss? Okay, breathe.
Lipstick lasts longer, but gloss is more fun.
Dan does love to dance, but he's terrible at it, so no laughing, and your feet won't hurt as long as you have just the right amount of champagne.
Other than that, just be yourself.
That's what I did at cotillion, and Dan and I had the most magical night ever.
And your hair looks great down.
I-I can't reach Louis, and I've barely had any time to bond with princess Sophie thanks to Cyrus' kibitzing.
She looks like she's enjoying the conversation.
Your stepfather is wonderful, Blair.
Yes, I loved him at first sight.
No, you didn't.
His knowledge of birds is magnifique.
Perhaps I judge you too harshly after the consulate affair.
Cyrus has told me of your job at "w" and your straight "a" average all while dedicating yourself to avian welfare.
You would never let a duck go hungry.
And you do make Louis very happy.
You and Louis may make your first formal appearance as an engaged couple this evening, if you like, at constance/st.
Jude.
Your first royal appearance.
I have ways of swaying the court.
There are certain dalliances that they would rather not have exposed.
It feels like we're family already.
But what is this? Oh.
Oh, uh It's true what they say about diamonds.
They cut not only glass but porcelain as well.
Oh! Did you hear the good news? I did.
Let us all raise a glass to the newly reinstated prince and princess-to-be.
May your lives be as full of love as the skies are of birds.
We need to talk.
Your attempt to destroy me will have to wait.
I have a meeting.
Oh, I'm not doing anything Except getting you the help you need.
Little unsteady, are we? It's okay.
It's understandable you'd succumb to substance abuse after all you've been through-- a mother who scammed you for profit, a stepmother who cut you out of your own company, and, of course, the love of your life leaving you for a monarchy smaller than Manhattan.
You're forgetting my Uncle that made me choose between my legacy and the love of my life.
Ah, yes.
Blair did jump at the chance to sleep with me again, didn't she? Hey! Hey! Hey! What the hell's going on? Get ahold of yourself.
Look who rode in on his high horse to tell me I told you so.
I'm coming to make sure you're okay.
I don't need your pity! Get out of the way or get hurt! First Blair, now me? You do need some help.
Which is why I've brought it.
You can't be serious.
After everything you've done, I'd have to be insane to not want to beat the crap out of you.
Yeah, well, they have experts who'll decide that.
Now you either go with these gentlemen, or I'll call the cops and file a civil suit against you.
Sorry, man.
You should go.
It's the only way.
Nathaniel, you're making a grave mistake.
Don't touch the suit! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Sedate him if necessary now.
Oh, and I guess you won't be needing this.
And remember, it only works if you work it.
We hear one Bass is hitting bottom.
Nicely played.
Feel free to take whatever you want, including precious works of art.
Looks like the hotel isn't the only Charles that needs rehab.
Hey.
What'd I miss? Oh, Cyrus charmed the princess into returning Louis to the throne.
But he's upstairs waiting to talk, and he didn't seem happy.
So I should probably go.
B.
, I know you don't believe me, but no matter how much we fight, all I've ever wanted for you is true love.
I'm--I'm sorry that it took me so long to realize that.
You--you deserve this.
Well It's not as if I haven't done my share of subversion.
Penelope would've gotten far too much satisfaction out of being the maid of honor.
Spotted-- a lush headed for lockdown.
Let's hope this Bass can survive on dry land.
You okay? I know I shouldn't care, but I'm worried about him.
Not tonight.
Go be a princess.
Rehab is probably the safest place for Chuck and your engagement.
Hey, you came.
So did you.
I mean, that's--that's all right, right? We're good? Yeah.
I mean, Blair's getting engaged, and--and you're taking Charlie to her first black tie event.
So seems everyone's moving on.
Thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry it took me so long.
But now we can finally celebrate you getting back your rightful place in your family and the country.
Blair, I know you saw Chuck.
Well, I I wanted him to hear about our engagement from me.
Twice? And I had to warn him that his evil Uncle was in town.
All of which sounds very noble, so why didn't you tell me? You--you know we have a history, so I was worried that You'd think it meant more than it did.
I saw him before I came here.
If he told you something happened, he's lying.
He's just trying to get you to leave me.
I saw his hand.
It's not the ring that cut your face.
Blair, how can you lie to protect someone who hurt you? Since I'm not seeing him again, there's no reason to embarrass him.
I think you're the one who's embarrassed.
You have your own dark side.
I understand if you want to end it.
It's very unbecoming of a princess.
I want you, Blair.
But the only way it will work is if you show me all of the parts of yourself, even the ones you're ashamed of.
Maybe if we don't talk about them, they'll just go away? I hope you'll join me at this party to make your formal debut.
If you're not ready to share your life--all of it-- don't show up.
I'll leave with my mother tonight.
Hey, I'm worried about Charlie.
She should be here by now.
Forget I asked.
Take your coat? That's my dress.
Gentlemen.
What the hell is going on? Divine intervention If you consider Satan divine.
You did get in one good punch.
It was a long time coming.
He was the one who reached out to me to help.
You see, as much as I love to screw with my nephew, your using me to do it just didn't sit right.
So on that tape you just put in your jacket pocket I mean, I knew you didn't just want to read your cheating wife's love letters.
All that was in that box was evidence against my father.
Even if he went to the authorities, the implications are limited on a dead man.
So we played follow the leader.
Unless you're into arson p0rn, there's obviously something else of interest on that tape.
Bart murdered my wife.
I can take my story to the press.
First, you'll stay for the viewing.
The time code is after my father left the building.
You're the one who locked the doors.
My father didn't set the fire that killed your wife.
You did.
Hey, you look great.
You want to, uh, you wanna grab a drink before we go? Ahem.
You should have asked me if you wanted to wear my cotillion dress.
I mean, you can borrow anything you want, but you do need to say something.
This isn't your dress.
I got this at Nina ricci, remember? You do have a lot of dresses, Serena.
Pamela Dennis made it especially for me.
I think I would know, and so should you, since you were my date.
Uh, I bought this myself.
I wouldn't steal from you.
Oh, okay, then let's see the label.
Well, it's in your mom's garbage.
It was jabbing me in the back.
I mean, I think I still have the red mark if you wanna see that.
No, no, whoa, whoa.
Stop, stop, stop.
Come on.
There are a million gold dresses.
Yeah, but there's only one with a Pamela Dennis label cut out.
Take it off.
This is obviously a misunderstanding.
Why are you defending her? You are not leaving here in that.
If you didn't want me to go to the party with Dan, you didn't have to humiliate me.
Okay, Charlie, this has nothing to do with Dan.
Good.
Then you won't mind if we leave together now.
You know, I was trying to take it slow with Charlie because I value our friendship so much, but Can we just call the cops? I'm hungry, and all you seem to have are olives and hallucinogenic mushrooms.
You have to believe me.
It was an accident.
Bart and I were partners.
I had proof that he was planning the fire, so when I found out he was sleeping with Avery, it was the perfect setup.
I was trying to keep my family together.
By killing the mother of your child? I swear to you, I thought it was Bart in that building.
I knew no matter what I said, he would never let Avery go.
It sounds crazy, but I still loved her.
And she loved you? I read the letter she wrote to my father ending things.
That letter was for me.
Bart called and said we needed to talk, that I should meet him at the building.
That was when I decided that he wouldn't be leaving.
That's what Avery and my father were arguing about on the tape? She wanted to tell you in person she loved him.
Unless we're close to the end of this sob story, I'm gonna order room service, okay? Your father and I made an agreement.
I would keep the proof of his involvement in the fire a secret.
I would give him the company, the insurance money, and go back to Chicago.
And he would say that he was responsible for the accident.
He always felt guilty about Avery being there.
I can't choose my entree with hallmark hall of fame playing in the background.
I'm calling the cops.
Please.
I'll pay.
I'll give you thorpe enterprises, anything you want.
But I can't let raina find out what I did.
I'll give you the same deal he did.
Oh, hey, girls, can we at least get my plane fare home out of this? Get out of New York and never come back.
Thank you.
If raina ever found out, I don't know what I'd do.
Blintz? No, thank you.
I've lost my appetite.
Well, how is that possible? You're returning to your Alma mater as the princess bride-to-be.
You and Louis are practically giddy about each other.
Not when he finds out who I really am.
You mean a brilliant and beautiful and Remarkably-strong- for-her-stature young woman? You may not be aware of this, but it's not all light and bright in here.
There are some places devoid of even a hint of sparkle.
Louis will love those, too, one would hope.
Chuck was the only one who ever did, but he couldn't see the rest.
Louis says he wants it all, but, ugh, what kind of a princess schemes and plays s*x games and dreams herself into old Hollywood movies? Well, uh, pretending as your stepfather that I didn't hear the s*x games part, the truth is The only way that you're gonna know if Louis is the one is to tell him everything.
But what if he doesn't love me after I do? Take it from someone who is head over heels for a Waldorf woman Even everything is not enough.
Hey.
You're late.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Something came up.
It was really important, but not that late.
What's wrong? Jack Bass called.
He's backing out of the whole plan, says he just used me for the free flight.
Well, that's Jack for you.
I told you he couldn't be trusted.
Really? We're talking about my payback for my mother's death, and you're "I told you so"-ing me? Raina, punishing Chuck's not gonna bring your mom back.
Chuck knew Bart murdered my mother, and he sat there and watched me get my hopes up about that waitress, and he tried to ruin my relationship with my father.
He should pay for that.
Okay, I know you're upset, but you have to trust me on this.
Chuck didn't do anything wrong.
First Jack, now you? What the hell's going on, Nate? I just think you've been through enough pain without digging up more.
I am not stopping until Chuck feels as bad as I do.
Chuck's father didn't kill your mother.
Yours did.
You gotta take that? Um no.
They say love is the best medicine-- that is, unless you don't take it.
Your dad was a nasty son of a bitch, but I never thought for a second he'd actually gone o.
J.
Well, thank you for using your evil powers for good this time.
Ah, it was selfish, really.
I didn't want anyone else playing with my punching bag.
Dysfunction is best kept in the family.
It's true.
Plus what would I want with a company someone else owns half of, or a building in Brooklyn? Now if you still had Blair, things might be different.
On that note, I'm going to cut this reunion short and try to find her before the nice guy actually wins.
I'm counting on you not to defile the Bass name and lose her to a family of titled circus performers.
I know what you did, dad.
Honey, what are you talking about? You're the reason my mother is dead.
Did, uh, Chuck Bass tell you that? He's lying.
He's trying to cover his own guilt.
Why don't I come and take you to dinner, and, uh, we can talk about it? Don't come near me.
The only one lying is you my whole life.
Raina, please.
You're as dead to me as my mother is.
Thanks for coming.
I couldn't resist finding out what you think we have in common, but unless it includes an apologyi'm not staying.
You accused me of getting Charlie to turn Dan against you.
Well, she just did the same thing to me.
You think Blair's behind it? I mean, Dan's a good kisser, but that good? It's Waldorf-level scheming, but Blair's in love with her prince.
This was all Charlie.
Hey, Serena and Vanessa? I'm not even gonna ask what the two of you are doing together, but have either of you seen Charlie? Thank you.
I don't know why being back here makes me feel like I'm on the outside again.
Oh.
Oh, you know why? 'Cause you're the only one talking to me.
What's up, kati, is? Nice to see you girls back together again, still dressing alike.
Do you hear something? No, nothing.
Come on.
You must have had some fun in high school.
Mm, not in actual school, no.
So you never did anything crazy like blow up a toilet or spray paint lockers or try to get some behind the bleachers? No, I was pretty much the anti-crazy.
We're gonna have to fix that.
You know, I was in here once after a swimming pool incident.
It was not the good kind of crazy.
Well that kind is better.
You shouldn't leave high school without doing it on a desk.
Call me Serena.
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait a second.
I think maybe this is not a great idea.
Queller is not known for her sense of humor, and, um Why don't you get dressed? and I'll meet you outside.
null oh, have you seen a prince? Yes, I am engaged to him, and you should be green with envy But I don't have time to make you wallow in it because I have to take this call.
Hello? What? Of course.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Serena's cousin.
Thank God.
Uh, I just got a call that Chuck needs me.
When Louis arrives, will you tell him that I was here and that I'll be back? Whatever you do, don't let him leave.
A dream is just a dream, or is it? So when you say Charlie went off her medication, you don't mean because the doctors told her to? No, her mother said it happened once before last time she was happy.
Ended pretty badly.
A place where fantasy and reality collide.
Chuck Bass.
What a disappointment.
I was rooting for you.
Have you seen the real Blair? Don't you read "Gossip Girl"? You lost her to the prince.
Not yet, I haven't.
I told you he wouldn't let her get away.
Everything you ever wanted seems possible.
Oh! Excuse me, sir.
Someone called me from the building and--and told me that Chuck Bass was up here.
He was threatening to jump and asking for me.
I'm Blair Waldorf.
Until you realize the nightmare's just beginning.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here-- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
You accused me of getting Charlie to turn Dan against you.
Well, she just did the same thing to me.
Your mom told me the last time things went well, you stopped taking them.
And then they went from well to hell.
Call me Serena.
What? Let us all raise a glass to the Prince and Princess-to-be.
I hope you'll join me at this party.
If you're not ready to share your life, don't show up.
Chuck Bass.
What a disappointment.
Have you seen the real Blair? Don't you read "Gossip Girl"? You lost her to the Prince.
Not yet, I haven't.
You're the reason my mother is dead.
Did Chuck Bass tell you that? My nephew is at the edge of a cliff again.
Nothing turns him upside down like losing Blair Waldorf.
Uh, someone called me from the building and--and told me that Chuck Bass was up here.
He was threatening to jump and asking for me.
Well, at least now we know why Charlie's been acting so unbalanced.
Yeah, because she is.
We need to find Dan before something happens to him.
And we need to find Charlie before something happens to her.
You know, this isn't her fault.
She needs help.
The last time this happened, she ended up wandering through the snow in her bare feet.
Yeah, after she "single white female'd" her college roommate.
Rufus said the girl's boyfriend led her on.
Fine.
She's in your dress with your ex, but if you're so concerned about Charlie, you find her, and I'll find Dan.
You know, maybe I should be the one to tell Dan what's going on.
At least he considers me a friend, which is more than you can say right now.
And whose fault is that? Yours.
You know what? Let's--let's not do this.
Why don't we both tell Dan together? And we'll both find Charlie together.
Fine.
Let's go.
Look at this place.
We've been-- we've been gone two years? Feels like 20.
Is raina here? No, she's not.
She, uh, asked to be alone.
Is everything okay? Not really.
You seem a little shaken up yourself.
What's going on? Charlie said something that kinda weirded me out.
I'm hoping it's just a crazy misunderstanding and not actual crazy.
What'd she say? Uh, well, uh, we were kissing, you know? And then things started to, you know So then she says, "call me Serena.
" What? Yeah.
Whoa.
Are you sure? I mean, maybe that's just what you wanted to hear.
Nice one, but yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
No, but if she really did say that, that's definitely weird.
Just tell her that's not necessary and get back to doing whatever it is you two were gonna do.
What's Chuck doing here? "Gossip Girl" said he was headed to rehab.
Yeah.
That's another long story.
What, we're at St.
jude's, so now suddenly I'm back out of the loop with everything? Look, I'll tell you later, I promise.
Ms.
Waldorf, I can't find Blair.
Well, she's bound to be here somewhere.
She left well before me.
Oh, there's the Princess and Louis.
Do you think she'd miss the opportunity to enter her old stomping ground on the arm of a prince? She is finally getting her fairy tale.
She doesn't need the big bad wolf to ruin it.
Why don't you say good-bye once and for all? And let her go.
Oh, hey, you know, if school was more like this during the day, I think I might have enjoyed it.
Thank God my student days are almost over.
Have you seen Charlie? Hey, we need to talk.
We need to talk to you.
I need to talk to you.
Hey, I need to talk to you.
Okay, whoa, just tell me that no one's trying to stop a wedding, run a Ponzi scheme, give anybody fake cancer, or turn into a justifiably vengeful townie? Usually I'm the one trying to get all of you people to listen to me.
As much as it pains me to think you might know the answer to this question, do you know where Blair is? What we have to say is far more important than the location of Blair Waldorf.
Yeah, we think Charlie's in trouble, and we need to find her.
At least you're okay, though.
I was worried about you.
Chuck, you gotta listen to me.
Raina-- I was worried about you, too, but, you know, now we're both worried about Charlie.
Nathaniel, I can't even think about raina until I know where Blair is.
Everybody, please, shut up.
I haven't seen Blair, and I've been around the room a couple times tonight.
But whatever Nate needs to tell you is--is obviously important, so I think you should hear him out.
As for Charlie, she has been acting a little strange, and I haven't seen her.
I'm looking for her, too.
What are you two doing together? Don't you hate each other? You tell him.
A half hour ago, I saw Blair talking to that girl wearing Serena's dress, and then she just bolted.
Nathaniel, if you still need to talk to me, I'm going to the empire to see if Blair's there.
Right behind you.
Look who got cute.
Uh, still gay.
That means you can dance.
So what's up with Charlie? I don't understand.
I specifically asked you not to tell raina the truth.
I had no choice.
She wanted to go after you.
If she confronted her father with any of this, now he will.
There will be repercussions, believe me.
Until I find Blair, I can't even think about Russell thorpe.
You might have to.
I'm sorry for just showing up like this.
I didn't know where to go.
My father was so angry, blaming you for all that's happened.
And after everything that I put you through, I just wanted to apologize.
No need to apologize to me.
We both did things we didn't know were wrong in the moment.
Still.
Thanks.
Blair isn't here, is she? No, and I've been here at least a half an hour.
So if she's not here, she's not at home or at the party, where is she? Hello? I don't understand why you're doing this.
You tricked me into coming to Chuck's new hotel by saying that he was in jeopardy, and now you won't let me leave.
What am I supposed to do, jump from the third story window? Come on.
I know where Blair is.
Smart girl.
You and Chuck might not be together, Ms.
Waldorf, but from what I can tell, you're still the thing he loves most in the world.
You're not going anywhere tonight.
Bonsoir, upper east siders.
Are you enjoying the party as much as I am? I know one person who isn't.
And this is our beautiful milo.
He's 10 months old, the little guy.
O.
M.
G.
So cute! Is he sleeping through the night? so Georgina can sleep in.
Your life sounds perfect.
It is.
So how did you two meet? Well, that's a real romantic story.
Phil wanted a hot wife to impress his partners, and I wanted a loft and a legacy at Yale for milo.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go get drunk enough to make you all seem interesting.
Dan.
Oh, of course you'd be here.
Oh, I can tell that you're up to something.
Please let me in on it.
I haven't been this bored since I believed in Jesus.
If I was up to something, and I'm not saying that I am, the last thing I would want is Georgina sparks getting involved.
Not unless the thing was twisted and nasty, in which case my help could prove invaluable.
How's the party? Oh, I promise, mom, you're not missing anything, unless you think Amy chua trying to convince headmistress queller to grade her kids more harshly is exciting.
Check your e-mail.
Thank you.
You're a good son.
Is that Eric at the party? Yeah.
Hey, Eric, have Serena and Vanessa found Charlie yet? I don't know.
Why? Uh, well, she's gone off of her-- don't embarrass her.
She'll be fine.
Um, look, um, if you see Serena, have her give me a call and check in, okay? Yeah, yeah, I'll find her right now.
Oh, Mrs.
Harrington, Mr.
Harrington, I'm so sorry.
Charlie, put down the bottle.
What are you doing? Why are you even here? Oh, obviously it's a mistake if you're anywhere near me.
Listen, maybe I-I think I overreacted before.
I mean, what you said-- it took me by surprise.
But the more I think about it, the more I get it.
You just want me to like you.
Well, I already do.
So what do you say about a do-over? We can go somewhere and just talk about this? Come on.
Yeah, why did you lead me on for weeks? Why didn't you just tell me you didn't like me? I mean, is that something you learned from Serena? Because-- excuse me, sir.
Whoa.
Oh.
All right, we need a plan "b.
" Serena.
Oh, headmistress queller.
Have you met our distinguished alum cecily? We've never met, but I've read a lot about you.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Bye.
So how is Providence? I'm at Columbia, actually.
Oh.
What happened to brown? Uh, well, I deferred for a year, and then when it was time to go back, my dad helped get me into Columbia so I could be close to my friends and family.
Oh, I know I was always hard on you, Serena, but it was only because I thought you could become something.
I had hoped you'd leave New York, see the world, maybe find your place somewhere far away from all this.
Oh, well, maybe after college.
What's wrong with you? Excuse me? Please don't tell me you're gonna lecture me about my choice of college, too.
College? No.
But how could you not end up with Nate or Dan? We both voted on "Gossip Girl's" poll, and we both lost.
So who did you end up with-- the billionaire, or the guy who tried to kill you? Neither, actually.
I used to wanna be like you, but now I wanna be Blair.
At least she's going to be a Princess.
Okay, shoo.
I'm perfectly happy with my life, but thank you for your concern.
Oh, spoke too soon.
I'd ask how you are, but I don't really care.
I'll take that as an opportunity to answer anyway.
I mean, I-I'd say I'm great.
Look at my hair, my clothes, my body, but I've actually become a bedford wife, and it's really just the worst thing.
Please let me in on whatever scheme everyone seems to be a part of.
I haven't conspired since I convinced Dan he was milo's dad.
Unless you count speeding up the process at a hospice to get someone's apartment.
A-anyway, I-I'm sure I can be useful.
Not to me.
I had Charlie, but she slipped away.
She's gotta be around here somewhere.
I'm sorry.
She's a part of the gang, but I'm not? Mine's from Charlie.
Mine, too.
"I'm sorry.
Good-bye"? Who is this amateur? Serena's cousin.
She's in trouble.
We have to come up with a new plan.
Oh.
The badger.
Th-the melon drop.
The Spanish prisoner.
Divide and conquer.
She could be anywhere.
Yeah, I'll, uh, I'll go to my dad's in case she goes home.
I'll go to the loft in case she shows there.
I'll stay here in case she comes back.
Okay.
What do I do? You can just go away.
I don't understand.
If you're not gonna torture me or wh-whatever, why don't you just let me leave? And why do you keep doing that? 'Cause it's taking longer than I thought.
What is? She said she was on the third floor.
Do you smell something weird? Like Gas.
I'm calling 9-1-1.
I turned it on before you got here, but this place is big and drafty.
Don't, don't! I I-I know you think the Basses are evil.
Trust me.
I get it.
I loved Chuck for so long, and He just punished me for it.
He ended up treating me like something he owned instead of something he earned, and it destroyed me.
I-I thought I'd never get over it.
But I finally found a way out of the darkness and You can, too.
No, I can't.
Don't! Stop! Chuck! Dad? Raina.
You shouldn't be here.
Neither should you, but if you go through with this, you're taking me with you, 'cause I'm not leaving without you.
I know you didn't mean to hurt my mother.
The fire was an accident.
I forgive you.
You're going to jail for a very long time, and I won't be coming to visit you, ever.
This just in--Blair Waldorf m.
I.
A.
At constance.
Doesn't she know her Prince is waiting? Or has she found a new one? Nate and raina are giving their statements to the cops.
You sure you don't wanna go to the hospital, get checked out? I'm fine, or I will be.
I just wanna get outta here.
Louis is waiting for me.
I'll drive you.
Thank you Not only for the ride but for, you know, saving me.
What was I supposed to do? You called.
Only because I couldn't see my phone to dial 9-1-1.
I still have you on speed dial.
I just had to push down the 1.
The 1, huh? I'm so sorry.
I know.
How about a drink to calm your nerves? Then we can return you to your Prince as steady as ever? Okay.
One drink.
That's all.
Thank you.
Nate I wanna go home.
Okay.
We can, uh, get another cab, go to your hotel.
I don't mean the hotel.
You mean Chicago.
Oh, my.
Closed for Joseph nitzberg's bar mitzvah.
The nitzbergs have great taste.
Maybe we should just go back to the party.
Why? Pretty much everyone we or Gossip Girl knows is there, which means it's almost like we've been given the rest of the night off to do what we want.
Like that movie "death takes a holiday"? Not the Brad pitt remake.
That was horrible.
What? It was.
"Helen and Murray erlich" sound nice.
Shall we? You scared me.
I get that a lot.
Do you know where I could find a window that opens? Most of them seem to be nailed shut, and I could really use the fresh air.
Top floor, last room at the end of the hall.
Thanks for helping me.
Have you seen Charlie? Maybe I have.
Maybe I haven't.
This is serious.
Every second you don't tell me where she went is critical.
Look, what if your kid in 17 years was in trouble and needed help? If milo isn't in trouble in 17 years, then I've done something wrong, but fine.
I'll tell you where Charlie went, but you owe me.
She took the elevator.
Thank you.
I miss you! You get me! Charlie.
You here? Insie by so that's it.
Time to go back to the real world.
You ready? I'm sorry, my dear, but you need to give this up.
Blair isn't coming.
You asked her a question, and this is her answer.
You know, the last thing I wanted was to see you be hurt.
And look what has happened.
I know she'll be here.
No, Carol.
I'm sorry.
We still haven't been able to find her.
I'll try Vanessa, see if she had any luck.
Okay.
No, we have everyone looking.
Watch out, s.
We find what we look for Charlie.
But never where we expect.
Charlie, no.
Charlie, what are you doing? Please come down from there.
I heard you talk to Dan and Vanessa about me.
You think I'm crazy.
Everyone does.
No, we don't.
We think you have a condition that can be helped.
If you come down, we can talk about it.
I-I'll get Dan if you want.
Dan doesn't like me.
That's why I stole your dress.
I'll never be like you.
You're Serena Van Der Woodsen.
That doesn't mean what you think it means.
Hey.
You okay? You didn't call when you got in.
Is Charlie there? No, I'm sorry.
I just I got caught up.
I found your book.
My what? "Inside.
" Dan, it's-- it's incredible.
You went through my stuff? Vanessa, you have no right to do that.
I know, and I'm sorry.
It's just this could be the best satire on the Upper East Side since "bonfire of the vanities.
" How long have you been working on this? Uh, five years, off and on.
Now put it back, and we can forget you found it.
I always thought Serena was the reason you fell into the Upper East Side, but it was more than that.
Vanessa, seriously, this is none of your business.
You always wanted in, maybe more than Jenny.
Of course, the irony is that if I ever show it to anyone, it'll guarantee my outsider status forever.
Dan, you know as well as I do you can't be an insider and make great art.
You have to stand alone to observe it and not care whose feelings you hurt or what people think of you.
Those people are my friends, my best friends, my family.
Well, it's not like any of them come across worse than you do, and there's a certain someone that might actually like the way she's painted.
And I'm not talking about Serena.
Get it published.
Take a stand.
Be a great man instead of always being a good boy.
Serena found Charlie.
I need to go.
And you need to put the book back and get out of my room.
Dan, this is important.
Don't just drop everything to run and help them.
Good-bye, Vanessa.
When are you gonna realize that you are better person until the day you asked Serena out four years ago? When are you gonna realize that I had a better life before you climbed up my fire escape four years ago? So I should find Louis and tell him it's over.
If that's what you want.
It's the right thing to do.
You really love him, don't you? Yes.
But not like I love you.
Louis and I-- it's different.
It's lighter, more simple.
He makes me happy.
And I don't.
What we have is a great love.
It's complicated, intense, all-consuming.
No matter what we do and how much we fight, it'll always pull us in.
What's mere happiness in the face of all that, right? So I'm sure Louis has left the party by now, so I'll have to tell him at the consulate.
Drop me off at constance, then you can take the limo.
Are you really going to tell me that there's something wrong with being you? Every girl wants to be you.
Every guy wants to date you.
You can do anything you want.
So can you.
All night, I-I've realized, I didn't choose college.
I never chose between Dan or Nate.
I didn't even choose Paris last year.
Blair told me I was going.
Trust me, I-I know what it feels like.
When you're not making your own decisions, you can feel helpless because you don't wanna hurt anyone.
But all you end up doing is hurting them and yourself.
It's what I did, and here I am, alone.
You're not alone.
I'm here.
Good.
But if you could do it over again, who would you choose? Dan or Nate? What are you doing? You're still here.
Why wouldn't I be? The party's almost over.
I know.
But Blair hasn't arrived yet.
How can you be sure she's even coming? Because I love her, and just as important, I believe in her.
I know she's scared, but she'll figure it out.
And I'll be here when she does.
You left your I knew you would come.
I'm sorry it took me so long.
We need to talk.
Blair no, I need to do this myself.
What's she's trying to say is you have my blessing.
I couldn't be more happy the two of you are getting married.
Don't you know timing is everything? Looks like someone just stepped on your lines.
Hey, what are you doing up here? Meeting Serena.
You, too, huh? Why do I feel like we've been here before? Hey, how you feeling? I'll be okay.
Thanks.
So what are we doing here? I owe you both an apology.
Did something happen I don't know about? No, it's not what happened.
It's what didn't happen.
Last fall, I asked you to wait around while I figured things out, and--and I never really did.
So I'm sorry if I hurt you both.
I-I hope you can find a way to forgive me.
Of course we can.
We already have, but it means a lot to hear it from you.
I'm sorry, too, for everything I did that caused problems, but especially for the way I acted with you, Dan.
All right, well, what do you say we get your coat? I'll take you home.
I'd like that.
Thank you.
Maybe I shouldn't have wanted to be you before, but now I definitely do.
I'll get our coats.
I'll get a cab.
Hey, I should call my mom and let her know that I'm okay.
Okay.
I'll be down there.
Hey, it's me.
I thought you should know it went perfectly.
I'll see you soon.
Did you find that open window? Vvq yeah.
But I shouldn't have been looking for it anyways.
I, um, was just off my meds.
No, I don't think so.
I don't think you were ever on meds.
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna bust you.
Since I assume you're about to be shipped off somewhere, if you're ever back in the city, let me know.
It's been getting a little dull around here.
Why did you just do that? 'Cause of what you said earlier.
About being happy? Chuck, that's not the most important thing.
People don't write sonnets about being compatible or novels about shared life goals and stimulating conversation.
The great loves are the crazy ones.
"L'amour fou.
" Blair, we're not living in Paris in the '20s.
We both wish we were.
There's a difference between a great love and the right love.
I left the empire state building last year after two minutes when you didn't show.
Louis waited all night.
This is your chance at happiness.
You think you shouldn't want it 'cause you've never had it, and it scares you.
But you deserve your fairy tale.
We make our own fairy tales.
Only when we have to.
You don't.
How do you feel about tonight? Awful.
Just Terrible.
In fact, I've never felt like this before.
Guilt.
I feel it, too.
Maybe I'm actually growing up after all.
I didn't wanna let you go just yet.
anyone tell you you're not powerful.
You're the most powerful woman I know.
It's taking all the power I have to walk away from you.
I know.
But I need to let you go.
You need to let go.
I will always love you.
I will always love you.
I had to say good-bye.
Chuck Bass and Blair Waldorf, happily never after.
They say parting is such sweet sorrow, but wouldn't it be nice if just once it didn't have to be? They're saying 20 years.
Sounds fair.
That's how long he kept the secret.
Well, I wouldn't wanna be in his shoes.
I can tell you that.
What about your shoes? When is that happening? Yeah, what are your plans for the summer, Mrs.
Humphrey? Well, I'm going to be getting very pale.
This thing doesn't come off until the fall, just in time to send my baby off to college.
Oh, Sarah Lawrence is, like, 15 minutes away.
I don't really think I need to be sent off.
A-a light breeze could take me there.
At least you don't have to worry about sun damage, and we don't have to spend the month of August with Eleanor and Cyrus on that cruise like they suggested.
Can you imagine? I don't think the principality of Monaco's yacht counts as a cruise, Mr.
Humphrey.
Well, they didn't mention that.
Maybe there's still time to r.
S.
V.
P.
Well, on that note, I think I'll head out, Nathaniel.
I'll hitch a ride.
So Monaco for the summer.
Yeah, Louis is picking me up in an hour.
Flying private? Is there anything else? So you're really getting married, huh? Yes, and you're actually going to be invited.
I bet you never thought you'd get to go to a royal wedding.
Only my own.
You think you could introduce me to Charlotte casiraghi? Listen, if the castle gets lonely, um, you wanna watch a movie with a friend I already copied your queue.
Our e-mail discourse begins Monday with hal ashby's "the landlord," and we'll take it from there.
Okay.
Hello? Uh, it's your car here to take you to the bus.
Are you sure you wanna take the bus, honey? Yes.
After everything I've been through, I could really use the downtime.
My mother was right.
This city isn't the best place for me.
Maybe someday I can come back and stay centered, but for now, back to Florida.
Thank you.
Bye.
I'm sad.
I kinda liked having a cousin around.
Me, too.
I really did like you.
I really did like you, too.
Transitions in life are usually marked by major events-- birthdays, graduations, weddings.
You must really be hurting.
How can you tell? You're not drinking.
I always know it's serious when even you know you can't dull the pain.
I'm not righrifor her.
We bring out the dark side in each other.
When she's with Louis, she shines.
That's the Blair I love.
If she needs to be with him to be it, then that's the way it should be.
Well, look at that-- Chuck Bass, maturing.
Sad but true, I'm afraid.
I had Victor pick this up.
Being at St.
jude's reminded me of all the lost weekends we used to have.
So why not graduate to a lost summer? I'm intrigued.
Just spin the globe and pick a point.
We can start there and make our way back here, like old times--bachelors who don't have to answer to anybody.
You're a good friend.
One of us has to be.
But the greater transitions often come out of smaller moments When we stop and look at who we are.
Because each time we see how far we've come, we also see how far we still have to go.
Hey, can I borrow your sun hat? Only if I can take your espadrilles.
I can't wait for Monaco.
Strolling in the jardin exotique, catching the exhibits at villa Paloma, while I lay on the beach in Montecito, off the radar, learning to surf, strolling through the farmers' market, while Cece with a teacup of gin in hand, harasses the help.
Well, you're gonna have a lot of fun, but are you sure you wanna be all by yourself the whole summer? I know a palace with an empty room or 50.
Being alone is just what I need--no boys, no bars, just a bottle of sunblock and a dozen of the best beach reads.
I needed to make a choice, and--and I choose me.
Well, who knows? Maybe the grimaldis' yacht can moor for a couple days in Malibu and we can meet up.
Oh, I'd love that.
Hey, have you picked a date yet? We're thinking November.
Well, that doesn't give me nearly enough time to find a dress to outshine yours, and you know I'll be wearing white, of course.
What are you talking about? I already told Louis' seamstresses to make you a maid of honor dress from the brightest fuchsia they could find.
Thank you.
Of course.
You don't think you're gonna get a little stir-crazy? Not really.
I'm producing panic's album in the city, so I'll have lots of company.
What about the house in the Hamptons? I mean, is Cece gonna be there this year? No, she's staying in Montecito for Serena.
Ah.
You know, I'm actually ashamed to admit this, but I was kinda looking forward to spending some time out there.
Since when do you like the Hamptons? I wouldn't mind leaving the city.
It's been getting me down.
You sad about Charlie leaving? I know you two were getting close.
It's not Charlie he's talking about.
Whoever or whatever it is, the Hamptons house is empty.
You can have it all for yourself.
Would you wanna come with? We could be each other's wingmen like Nate and Chuck.
Maybe break up a couple or two.
Uh, yeah, thank you.
Get me outta here.
Who knows? With all the, uh, relaxing you do, maybe you can get a little writing done while you're there.
I don't know.
I think maybe, uh, my writing days are behind me.
You were right.
I loved it.
So did my team here.
We think it's one of the best debut novels since Jonathan Safran foer.
Who exactly wrote it? I promised my client I wouldn't say, but I'm sure once it's published, the author will come forward.
He'll--he'll have to.
Where should we send the checks? To me.
I'll pass them along to the author.
Barcelona? I'm moving there.
Nothing's really keeping me here.
In order to fully transform, we might need to free ourselves of everything we've been holding on to.
To sends us on our new path-- the right one.
Uh, hi.
Hi.
Sorry.
Do we know each other? No, no, no.
It's just "the beautiful and damned"-- it's one of my favorite novels.
I can't believe you were reading it.
Normally, people only read novels around here because they're trying to turn them into movies, so Which is exactly what you're doing, isn't it? I kind of lied to my boss about having already read it.
I'm supposed to do a scene-by-scene comparison of the book to the script.
Meeting's in an hour.
Any chance you could help me? Well, I don't know how I feel about helping someone cut corners.
But if it's for the good of Fitzgerald, I suppose I don't have to meet my grandmother for another hour.
Let's see.
How far did you get? Not far enough.
That's my boss.
Hey, what are you doing here? What are you doing? What are you doing? Oh, my gosh.
David o.
Russell.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm David.
Hi.
I'm Serena.
I'm such a huge fan of your work.
Thanks.
Are you turning "the beautiful and damned" into a movie? Well, I'm trying to turn "the beautiful and damned" into a movie.
Do you have the notes for the meeting? Almost.
Almost? We gotta go.
I understand.
I've been working on them.
No, you're not.
You're talking to a beautiful girl, which I understand, but-- "beautiful things only grow to a certain height, and then they fail and fade off.
" You read the book.
Yeah, of course.
I-I read the book.
You read the book.
She read the book.
I relate to it more than I should admit.
I got an idea.
We got the beautiful and the damned.
So this is not your assignment now.
If you want a job Oh, my God.
I can get this done.
Well, she actually read the book, though.
What do you think? If you can prepare me for the meeting Um, yeah.
Hi.
How was the trip? It was long, but nice.
They're all in there.
You can count Thank you, Ivy.
You played your part perfectly.
Well, thanks for hiring me.
I have to say it was A pretty devious plan.
Well, you met my family.
You know where I get it from.
Yeah.
At least now they won't come looking for my daughter.
You gonna be all right going back to your real life after having been a part of that world? I think I'll be fine.
Good luck.
But if at the end, you find the person you've become is not the person you want to be You can always turn around and try again.
And maybe the next time, you won't be so alone when it's over.
Too late to turn back now.
X.
O.
X.
O.
Gossip Girl.
I found your book.
If I ever show it to anyone, it'll guarantee my outsider status forever.
I'm sure once it's published, the author will come forward.
There's a certain someone that might actually like the way she's painted, and I'm not talking about Serena.
Blair, we kept us a secret 'cause we were afraid there was something more.
Dan and I have a real connection.
That is, until a prince came along.
Being together means going against my family, and if I'm going to take a stand, I need to know for certain that you feel as I do.
Will you marry me? You are cousin Charlie? Well, wait.
What about your trust fund? Why haven't you gotten it yet? I have to say it was a pretty devious plan.
Thank you, Ivy.
You played your part perfectly.
What we have is a great love.
No matter what we do and how much we fight, it'll always pull us in.
I should find Louis and tell him it's over.
We need to talk.
When I need to tell you is What she's trying to say is, you have my blessing.
This is your chance at happiness.
You deserve your fairy tale.
It's taking all the power I have to walk away from you.
But I need to let you go.
Being alone is just what I need.
No boys, no bars.
Just a bottle of sun block and a dozen of the best beach reads.
Are you turning "The Beautiful and Damned" into a movie? I got an idea.
We got the beautiful and the damned.
So this is not your assignment now.
I always know it's serious when even you know you can't dull the pain.
Just spin the globe and pick a point.
Bachelors who don't have to answer to anybody.
What is it? God, you're such a swan in this light.
Cut! Perfect! Print.
Okay, one thing I wanted to say.
That was great.
Loosen up.
Enjoy it a little bit.
Just 'cause you're in white tie doesn't mean you can't be dirty and drunk.
That's how these people were back then.
Right.
You know what I'm saying? They were having a good time.
So don't make it stiff.
You know, enjoy it a little bit.
Uh, the "New York Times" called and wants a quote on the decision to set the movie on the days of the crash of '29.
But I told that guy I don't wanna do that unless I first get the e-mail from Sue Zucconi.
Okay.
Hi.
Hey, Serena.
How are you? Good.
How are you, David? Good to see you.
Thanks.
Oh, no, no.
It's okay.
I got it.
You're busy.
But then who would answer the phones in the production office? I had the calls forwarded to my cell.
Well, if you're hands-free, all the better to collate the revisions and the production team's drafts.
Marshall, remember when you said that I could observe filming one day before the shoot was over? Shoot's not over till next week.
Serena? Thank you.
Whoo! Dad! What are you doing here? I thought you'd still be in London, helping Jenny set up at Saint Martins.
Oh, she and Eric kicked me out when I didn't know who Sarah Burton was, so I came back here early and thought I'd spend some time with you.
Well, happy to have you.
Yeah.
I popped by Cece's.
This was waiting.
Maybe it's important.
It's from the city.
Huh.
It's, uh, Blair's "save the date"" you're not happy.
You guys are still friends, right? Yeah.
Friends.
Wonder if she invited Chuck.
If he's anywhere that fedex can reach Hi.
I don't believe we've met.
I'm Nate Archibald.
And, uh, you are? Waiting for me.
How was your nap? Great.
You were gone.
It's the only time I can sleep.
Why didn't you take someone with you for a change? Anything for me? Nope.
Well, if you hear anything crazy, it means I'm doing something right.
How does it feel to be home? Oh, it's gonna be tough reacclimating.
After living in a palace, how will a penthouse do? But maybe we should skip the wedding planning and pull the blinds and just spend the day in bed? We did that all summer.
But we can't put off our parents any longer.
Would a present help motivate you downstairs? Oh! How did you know just what I was missing? Shall I wear it to your Uncle's speech at the general assembly tomorrow? Unfortunately, you will not be allowed inside until you are an official member of the royal family.
Consider yourself lucky.
Albert's speeches are stronger than Ambien.
I do consider myself lucky.
I'm living a fairy tale.
But no heroine gets her happy ending without overcoming some obstacles, and this wedding will be no exception.
A civil service and a religious ceremony? Who has ever heard of such a thing?! Our guests will be sitting longer than a Terrence Malick movie.
I'm you're rock.
You can count on me.
How did you guys end up here? And--and whose boat is this? This is Allegra Versace's.
Chuck won it in a poker game in Chiang Mai.
He won Allegra, too, but, uh, that's another story.
Wow.
So--so he's okay then? Ask him yourself.
Serena.
Oh! Mwah! Hey.
Whoa.
Usually when you smile like this, you look like a creepy cheshire cat, but this one is real.
What is your secret? And if it's legal, I want some.
It's not a substance.
It's a state of mind.
A word.
Well, let me guess a dirty word.
"Yes"" yes, it's a dirty word? The word is "yes.
" I say it at anything.
If an opportunity presents itself, I take it.
There's nothing I won't try once, even happiness.
Mm, he's very inspiring.
I've been saying all summer he should run an infomercial.
You mock, but if someone gave me the opportunity, I'd say Yes.
Yeah, I think I get it.
I don't think you do.
See, you've been working all summer in your little assistant's job, driving a cart, getting coffee, sorting things.
Isn't there something more you want out of it? Actually, the producer, Jane, who I really admire, asked me my thoughts on a scene.
And I was really excited to write something up, but then Marshall, who's technically my supervisor, got wind of it and, uh He wasn't a huge fan of the idea.
What, so you never did it? Well, no, I placated Marshall, so now Jane probably thinks I'm a flake.
There's still time.
Go say the "ye"" you never said.
You know what? You--you are actually right.
And even if you are completely delusional, if it makes you look this good, I will find Jane tomorrow, Marshall be damned.
Who wants to go with me to make sure I actually go through with it? I know what you're gonna say.
Daniel.
Hey.
I was thinking about you just yesterday, old boy.
Read an advanced copy of a story that "Vanity Fair's" running in their next issue.
Reminded me of your work, only better.
Who wrote it? That's the thing.
No one knows.
Totally anonymous.
And everyone's talking about it.
What's the story about? Ah, it's a little wharton and a lot wolfe.
The modern mores and misdoings of upper crust Manhattan.
I thought of you because the protagonist's name was Dylan Hunter, of all things.
The initials being what they are Uh I'm sorry, Jeremiah.
I gottaI gotta run.
I see from your list of demands, Blair Demands? That you would like to have peonies in your bridal bouquet.
They're my favorite flower.
And they are very beautiful, but In our country, a bride always walks with carnations.
Hmm.
To the nearest florist and demands a refund.
I'll be holding peonies.
Aren't I, Louis? Louis? With you looking so beautiful, who will even notice the flowers? Oh, "Vogue Paris" would like to have a photo of you in your wedding dress for their November issue.
Obviously, this is a very big deal as As "Vogue Paris" is perhaps the best thing to happen to the world ever.
Well, I know this is very short notice, but not to worry, because my dress is already on the plane here.
Your dress? Everybody has been married in this dress, from my great-grandmother on down.
Louis, I've already lost on the food, the flowers, You know how important choosing my dress is for me.
But this is a dress for a royal.
Hey.
You'll love maman's dress.
I-I promise.
I can't wait to see you in it.
How about some cold prosecco to kill the pain? This just in.
Due to a reader's dumpster dive outside a well-known fifth Avenue Prewar, it appears someone we know and love is in the family way.
So this is your humble Gossip Girl issuing an A.
P.
P.
B.
Who could the mother of our next scandal be? What's wrong, Dorota? Nothing.
Uh, nothing at all.
Prosecco? No, thank you.
I think I need all my wits for the next round.
Oh, no, it's okay.
I gave up drinking at the beginning of summer.
You know, L.
A.
lifestyle.
Come on.
You guys need one.
Cheers.
At least this secret is bound to show itself soon.
The first meeting was a disaster, s.
He conceded to Sophie on everything.
Oh, it was so out of control, you would've thought he was Italian.
Well, finding a balance between your mother and your fiancee has gotta be tough.
I'm sure he's just trying to keep the peace the best he can.
Stop being so rational and trying to see both sides.
I haven't even told you the worst part yet.
They want me to wear Sophie's dress.
Not just on the day, but in "Vogue Paris," too.
Hand-me-downs are for charity and second children, not for the bride on her wedding day.
Louis knows how upset I am.
He said he'd talk to Sophie, but I don't know.
B.
, first of all, "Vogue Paris", that's amazing! And you're gonna look beautiful in whatever you wear, which should be Sophie's gown.
That way, she has a gorgeous photo of you looking exactly how she wants, and that way you have more leverage to wear your own dress on the real day.
See, this is why I wish you were here.
Aren't you done out there? Los Angeles is a plastic surgery layover, not somewhere you live.
Serena, your guests just came through the gate.
Okay, thank you.
I'll be right there.
B.
, I love you and I miss you, too.
All right.
Tomorrow, same time? Today we did me, so we can do you? Of course.
You're on my schedule.
Aw.
Listen to you, all professional.
Bye.
Miss Blair, have you seen "Gossip Girl" lately? No.
We need to discuss something Something affecting both our futures.
The only thing affecting our futures is your inability to clear a table fast enough.
It appears that Louis has spoken to Sophie.
**** I need to look my best for my first royal apology.
Here you go.
Thank you.
And do you mind telling Jane that I need to talk to her? I know they're on lunch.
Sure.
I don't remember approving a set visit for your friends.
You must be Marshall.
And who are you? He's Chuck Bass.
Hey, so the stuntman's prepped for the fall.
Can you, uh, ask David to meet me by the bag to talk to the double? What's the stunt? I could show you.
You know what I have to say.
Then go.
I have to find David.
I'll tell Jane you stopped by.
Get back to work.
Well, the zip codes may be different, but douche bags are the same no matter where you go.
But now he's gone.
Go find Jane.
Okay, what are you gonna do? Hey, s.
Is this my noon audition? - Yes.
Are you kidding me? You're kidding me.
You're gonna be great.
Yeah, I'll totally hold.
Thanks, Epperly.
I don't get it.
Why would Vanessa steal your story? Oh, to teach me a lesson.
Let's just, uh, hope I'm wrong, which I'm not.
Did Gabriela ever call you back? You think maybe Jenny's heard from Vanessa? Why would she call Jenny? Yeah, yeah, I'mI'm here.
Okay.
Thank you.
Epperly's friend at "Vanity Fair's" says all he knows is Graydon Carter read the story and decided to run it.
Oh, that's pretty cool, right? I mean, "Vanity Fair's" gonna publish your writing? If only they were doing it because of my writing.
I mean, theyThey think it's about a celebrity.
Really? Why? Oh, because it's about a celebrity, kind of.
Uh, Blair Waldorf, future Princess of Monaco.
I wrote it in the spring, after she and I What? Where you going? To find the one person what can help me stop this before it's too late.
It's okay.
I accept.
Accept what? Your apology.
You didn't talk to your mother.
It's just so hard to say no to her.
I worry she'll make things more difficult later if she doesn't get her way right now.
I'm trying to ease her into our future.
The future is here.
We're gonna be married in three months.
I need to know that we're in this together and I'm not just standing here alone.
You're not.
I'm right here.
Those are just words.
I need proof.
You're right.
The dress discussion can wait until tomorrow.
But tonight, I show my mother that you come first.
Be ready at 6:00.
Ready for what? You will be on my arm at the general assembly gala.
I thought there was a rule.
It's about to be broken.
What do you say? This isn't right.
These two walls need to be white.
Serena.
Are you looking for Marshall? No.
You, actually.
I hope it's to tell me why you didn't follow up after our first meeting.
I didn't scare you away, did I? No.
No, no, no.
Not at all.
I just didn't want to step on Marshall's toes.
Why not? Keeping on them is what David hired you to do.
If it weren't for you, he wouldn't have even read the book.
And it was his thoughtful comparison of the book to the script that's helped keep all of the departments focused.
But I-I did that the first week.
If I would've known he was doing it, too, I I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble.
Please don't No one's in trouble.
A little reminder that things don't go unnoticed never hurts.
What would you say to a little more responsibility, see how you do with it? I'd say Yes.
Jane just called, gave me the rest of the day off.
Said I was taking too long to finish her task list and that I should leave the rest to you.
Looks like things really do come easy to Serena Van Der Woodsen, just like I heard.
But if you think you can do my job better than I can, here's the test.
"Pull tomorrow's sides, "update phone sheet, take dogs to groomer, write coverage of eugenides.
" This isn't so bad.
How long did she give you to do this? Till tomorrow.
Okay, well, I'll have it done by the party later.
Well, I hope I don't see you there.
Oh, you will.
Wait.
Have you seen my friends? Hey, get down from there! What was that? Were we rolling? Guys.
Guys.
G You're about to be in a lot of trouble, but I get the feeling you don't care.
You free tonight? I am now.
Oh! I forgot to ask you.
How was the audition? Well, after I told them I wasn't an actor, they said, "that's too bad, because you'd be perfect "as a kid from an east coast political family "who's constantly manipulated while trying to keep everyone around him happy.
" They told me that.
You should've said, "yes!" I mean it.
If there was still in Oprah, she would've been all over that.
Oh, I like Gayle.
Me, too.
So by the way, thank you for letting me use your card.
If you hadn't been here, I don't know how I would've gotten this task done Which I'm sure was Marshall's intention.
Hey, gotta love California's laws.
Oh, by the way.
Does Patrick Roberts have glaucoma or something? Like a--like a little nervous twitch? Who knows? It was the last thing on the list.
"Get Patrick his medicinal weed.
" I wonder which one he'll want Blueberry headband, dragon of shaolin, or Sushi Friday? Headband's pretty good From what I've heard from people telling me that it's good.
No, no judgment.
I'm just curious why you need it.
It's not like cruising around on a yacht is stressful.
Uh, no, I know that, okay? But doing nothing has given me a lot of time to think, you know? And maybe the last couple years are starting to take their toll on me, between my family, Juliet Raina, you.
I mean, sometimes I wish I could just reinvent myself, you know? Well, you've come to the right place.
Everyone in Hollywood reinvents themselves.
I mean, look at me.
I have gone from "it" girl to working girl in just 3,000 Miles.
I'm impressed.
I'm impressed.
Look, if you're sick of being you, be someone else for a while.
Yeah, and just where do you suppose that I do that? At the party we earned our way into tonight.
What do you say? My, don't you look lovely! Miss Blair go to U.
N.
With Louis and the Princess? I-I-I thought it wasn't proper.
It isn't.
Miss Blair testing prince.
Louis told me he would stand up to his mother tonight.
So if he does, everything can continue the way it's meant to.
And if he doesn't, he and his mother will have a lovely wedding in November without a bride.
Or she could just take my place, which seems to be what she wants.
Wish me luck.
Darling, is the stress of the wedding getting to you? Testing a good man who loves you never ends well.
Nothing is getting to me, mother.
I am a Waldorf woman.
I need to know I still have a voice and that that voice is heard.
Now I'm gonna go wait for Louis downstairs.
I swear, sometimes I don't know where she gets it from.
Louis.
Dan.
Hey.
Uh, listen, I-I really need your help.
I wrote a story that this magazine is publishing in their next issue, and I really don't want them to.
I have no idea how to stop it, but I-I figured, you know, if you put your royal weight behind it, it could be dead in an hour.
I'm sorry.
I have an event I'm late for.
Blair is Blair is the one the story's about.
I swear to you, if this story ever sees the light of day, you are not gonna be happy.
You ready to go? I thought your text said you were bringing a friend.
Oh, Marilu got a ride with Patrick Roberts.
She goes wherever he goes anyway.
Why? Are they together? No, she's his minder from the bond company.
He has to stay sober, or the film gets shut down.
Luckily, you and I don't.
But you won't be needing that helmet.
I brought my truck.
Riding Mulholland can be pretty dangerous, and that's where the party is.
Well, I'll throw this inside.
Stick and stones may just break bones, but the wounds from words never heal Especially when they're words we hoped we'd never read.
On second thought, I'm sure I could ride carefully.
Nothing's that dangerous, right?
Hey.
Here you go.
Oh, you can't possibly Have finished? She did.
Everything? Well, technically, there's still one thing left.
Have you see Patrick? Yeah, outside by the pool.
This is your chance.
What are you talking about? Come on.
You're at a party all the way across the country from your real life, where no one knows your name.
Who do you wanna be? No.
No, I'm pretty sure that's not how it works.
All right? Oh, my God.
Are you that guy-- that guy from that movie? Uh yes.
I love that guy.
Can we have your autograph? Yeah.
Do you live in L.
A.
? - Yes.
Is that your Maybach in the driveway? - Yeah.
This is your house? - Yes.
How about a tour? Yes.
Absolutely.
Uh, this is a private tour.
My, my.
If it isn't New York's finest.
Nice to see you out and about for once.
Thanks, Patrick.
It's good to be out.
Hey, I, um, have something for you.
What are you doing? Production sent me for it.
Well, that is awesome.
Marilu said it was cool? Well, I-I guess.
Have fun? I will now.
I can't even believe I'm answering this call.
I'm so sorry, Blair.
Something's come up that's taking me longer than anticipated.
Now it looks like I won't make it to the gala at all.
You're going with "Vague" on this one? "Something's come up"? Why don't you just admit that you're already in the U.
N.
with your mother instead of lying? I'm not.
I wish I could tell you where I am, but I made a promise.
And we know how you honor the promises you make, as long as they're not to me.
Tell your mother congratulations.
She won.
What are you talking about? Call down to Jimmy and tell him to get me a cab.
Where are you going? - Do you collect? - Yes.
A Helmut Newton, right? Yes.
Is that Lauren Hutton? Yes.
Or is it Lisa Taylor? Yes.
How'd you know? Mm, I have a good eye And good taste.
Is this the master bedroom? Let's destroy it.
How is the score going? Uh, well, we've almost finished the key theme.
And we've been listening to that Leonard Cohen score that he did for "McCabe & Mrs.
Miller" for inspiration.
Wow.
I'm sorry.
Would you two excuse me just for a minute? Is everything okay? Marshall just informed me that he found Patrick with some pot, which luckily he was able to confiscate before disaster struck.
Disaster? Marilu's from the insurance company.
The movie only keeps its completion bond if Patrick stays sober.
If she found out he broke his sobriety, she'd have to shut the movie down.
I can't imagine how he got his hands on it.
Well, I'm gonna go get Patrick.
He'll tell us.
He is scared out of mind at what he almost did.
Excuse me.
Oh, thank God.
I was Blair? Hey, what are you doing here? Did Louis, uh Uh, I didn't know where else to go.
I wasn't gonna come here.
I hadn't talked to you all summer, and You're the only person I know in New York right now, and I really need a friend, if you're still Of course I am.
What's going on? I am about to call off my engagement.
I can't marry someone who doesn't stand up for me, not even to his own mother.
And when I tell him it's over, I'll need to get away, to clear my head.
You were in the Hamptons? Uh, amagansett.
Cece's house.
Is it empty? Take me there.
Okay.
Uh, we can, uh, we can take my dad's car.
You'll call Louis from there.
I'll be there with you, for whatever you need.
Often, all it takes to find a new path is to make a sharp turn and see what you find.
You gotta take it easy up here.
People write songs about wiping out on our L.
A.
roadways.
I'm not scared.
Well, you should be.
I'm not scared of anything.
But beware.
Sometimes what you're faced with is a dead end.
Oh, my God.
Are you okay? I'm perfect.
You see any blood anywhere? I could use a glass of scotch, however.
Should we walk or should I drive you on yours? Okay, I know I don't know you at all, and you probably could give a damn about what I have to say.
Most of the people in my business are in it because they're thrill-seekers or adrenaline junkies.
But for some of them, there's something darker going on.
I think you need help.
I said I'm fine.
Well, that may be, but This date is over.
Good luck, Chuck.
Thank you.
My best friend was right.
Saying "yes" makes everything better.
Well, based on my own recent experience, I've have to agree.
Now it's time for you to leave.
Well, if that's how you want to be about it, okay.
But it is my house.
Don't you think you should be the one to go? Actually, this is my house.
And just so you know, this isn't the master bedroom.
It's a guest room the smallest one.
Nice to meet you, by the way, um Nate.
Mm.
That's a great name.
Uh, and you are? Done now.
How could you do this to me? You think I didn't know what you were up to? Try to tell me that doing everything on Jane's list wasn't just to show me up.
So you decided to add a few tasks that could get me fired, not to mention shut down the movie? I didn't think you could actually come through.
I thought you'd have to tell Jane you couldn't finish.
I need this job more than you do, okay? I pay for my life.
I have student loans, rent, a car lease.
I can't afford to get fired.
And I can? You're Serena Van Der Woodsen.
You do one lap around this party, you'll get ten job offers.
You weren't even looking when you found this one.
In two weeks, when you're at college, will you even look back at this as anything more than that thing you did that summer? This is my career.
I haven't found him yet, but when I do Marilu, wait.
What's going on? I'm the one that gave Patrick the pot.
And he only took it because I told him production okayed it.
Someone played a joke on me, and if I wasn't so intent on proving my worth, I-I wouldn't have fallen for it, but I did.
I'm sorry.
You can tell Jane I'll clear out my desk in the morning.
I don't understand, Louis.
Are you following me now? No, Blair.
Actually It's fine if you are, because I can do this in person then.
No, Louis is not here for you.
He's not? What the hell is going on? Louis didn't meet you tonight because he was helping me.
Helping you what? Last spring, I-I-I wrote a story about you, and due to a series of unfortunate events, that story is going to be published.
Was going to be.
Was.
Uh, I asked, and Louis kindly obliged to Help me kill it before it came out so it wouldn't embarrass you, and that's exactly what he did.
He really is your prince.
It may not have been standing up to his mother, but it was protecting you against the world.
You gotta understand, I didn't ever think anyone would read it.
You let me almost walk away from everything tonight.
And all the while, you knew exactly where Louis was, exactly what he was doing for me.
How could you let that happen? Why would you? What possible reason could you have? Lonely boy learning three words, eight letters don't come out right when no one wants to hear them.
Come on, Louis.
Let's go.
I'm done here.
Hey, are you happy? We decided what we wanted, went after it like you said, and look what happened.
Yes, look.
Serena, you accepted responsibility without hesitation for maybe the first time in your life.
And, Nate, you had more fun not being you than you've ever had actually being you, which means you now know you need to change.
Is it just me, or is what he's saying actually making sense? Maybe we're not awake yet.
We're growing up.
We need to start being responsible for ourselves instead of always being responsible for others.
What, you knew? Nate, I know you think I must be dying inside because Blair is marrying another man.
But we let each other go.
So stop doing stuff like this and start focusing on yourself.
And you.
Though this part of your journey may have come to an end, it shows you there's a world out there you never knew existed, one you want to be part of.
Have you ever thought of writing a book? People like me don't write books.
We're written about.
Okay, I should go clean out my desk.
Yep.
I should probably get outta here, too.
I'm pretty sure I left my phone at the party last night, and while I'm at it, I should probably apologize to the hostess.
I'll stay here alone with my genius.
Come here.
Ah.
Too close.
Too close.
Don't be shy.
Don't be shy.
What? No, is it my hair? I didn't want to say anything in front of Louis, but I found something hidden in the pantry.
Is this why you have been acting so strange about Louis? Is there something you need to tell me? Is me who needs to confess.
Baby number two on way.
This is what you needed to tell me yesterday that would affect our future? Yes.
I-I just want to tell you first, but you were away, and it not right to text "Hello, pregnant!" AndAnd then you were back, but you did not let me speak, and so now news comes out this way.
At least news out.
And "Gossip Girl" talk about me.
I feel so special.
Congratulations! Well, well, well, upper east siders.
I got my answer after all, and it turns out the only thing expanding at the Waldorf residence is the help.
Yet all this talk about expecting has got me thinking about expectations.
I had no idea I was gonna meet him out here, I didn't expect to make contact till New York.
But something tells me I'm gonna see him again even sooner than I imagined.
Oh, much sooner.
Call you later.
You must be here for this.
Yes.
Thank you.
And listen, I know you don't know really know me at all, but I feel like I owe you an apology for pretending to be someone else.
And I only did it because I'm just now starting to realize that, well, I don't really know who I am.
Anyway, I'm sorry, but I still had a lot of fun with you.
As did I.
And I accept.
Who knows? Maybe we'll see each other around sometime.
Yeah.
Good-bye.
Bye.
You wanted to see me? Yes.
There's a whole load of things I need done on my list this morning.
Oh, I-I guess you didn't hear.
I heard.
Marilu told me.
"The Beautiful and The Damned" wraps in a week, but how would you like to keep working for me? You're the first one in every morning, the last one to leave every night.
I need someone with your dedication and fire.
Although you might want to check with me the next time one of my tasks seems a little off-the-wall.
Yeah.
Well, what do you say? I would love to.
Hey.
What's going on? Lily has another meeting with the decorator.
She's redecorated so many times, it looks exactly the same.
I keep telling Andy Cohen he should make a show about her called "The Real House Arrests of New York.
" Well, you can, uh, hang here with me, help me with this mail.
Good, because I have some time before the 9/11 Memorial 10th Anniversary album launch.
Oh, and by the way, your story was amazing.
Thanks for letting me read it.
I'm just a little bit confused.
I-I expected something negative about Blair, but in fact, it was quite the opposite.
Why was it so important that no one read it? Did you make it to the end? Well, I assumed that was artistic license.
Did that actually happen? Mm.
A writer never tells.
So now I just have to make sure that the book that chapter comes from never sees the light of day.
There's a whole book? Well, don't get too excited.
I'm hoping, uh, Vanessa only leaked the one chapter to the magazine, since that's all they had.
Oh, look.
Air mail from Barcelona.
The thing about expectations is most of the time, someone else sets them for you, yet you feel like they've been there all along and you can't wait to live up to them.
You ready to go? I'm not coming.
Guess why.
Jane offered me a job.
What did you say? I said yes! Really? That's great.
Oh, thank you.
I mean, it wouldn't have happened without you two.
How about now? Your new L.
A.
lifestyle ready to make an exception? Well, I think so.
Pop it open.
Of course that happened.
Jeez.
There'sThere's a bathroom in the dressing room right there.
I'll be right back.
Just come on.
But just because you know what's expected of you doesn't mean you still can't surprise everyone.
Blair You look beautiful.
Of course she does.
Mother, Blair is not carrying those.
And there are some other things I need to talk to you about, too.
Do they know? Know what? How far along you are.
I'd say six weeks? They sent me your measurements.
Well, you obviously can't read, or they were wrong when you got them Because I'm not pregnant.
Lie to me all you want, but your body will be telling the whole world the truth by the time of your wedding.
Nothing stays hidden for long.
The one month anniversary of our move.
It's crazy.
What's crazy is if your Uncle hadn't left you that tiny bit of money, we never would've left Miami.
I just hope you don't mind working a crap job with me till we figure stuff out.
No, I'm just glad to be away from there.
Ivy, stop talking to your boyfriend and start working.
You're late.
Don't get fired.
We need the cash.
Charlie! And you often find what you least expect is right in front of you Oh, my gosh! Serena? Waiting to change everything forever.
What are you doing here? Oh, what am I doing here? What are you doing here? Ivy.
Ivy, your shift.
That was weird.
Um, let's get out of here.
Yeah, let's go.
Okay.
Whether you want to or not.
So good to see you.
It's good to see you.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here, your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
How about a tour? Absolutely.
It is my house.
Don't you think you should be the one to go? Actually, this is my house.
Nice to meet you, by the way, um Nate.
How would you like to keep working for me? I would love to.
I have to say it was a pretty devious plan.
Thank you, Ivy.
You played your part perfectly.
One month anniversary of our move.
Ivy, stop talking to your boyfriend and start working.
Charlie! Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here? Why would Vanessa steal your story? To teach me a lesson.
People write songs about wiping out on our L.
A.
roadways.
I'm not scared of anything.
Do they know? Know what? How far along you are.
I'd say six weeks? I'm not pregnant.
Lie to me all you want, but your body will be telling the whole world the truth by the time of your wedding.
Rise and shine, upper east siders.
It's time for your annual checkup.
Lucky for you, doctors take their confidentiality seriously around here.
Are you sure this doctor's reputable? Your prenatal care is imperative.
You never care about my womb before.
Maybe this is way to avoid seeing Mr.
Louis off on trip to Monaco for feast of assumption holiday.
Louis' sister Beatrice is picking him up at noon in their jet, which gives us plenty of time to discuss your gestational issues.
Dorota, how are you feeling? She's fine.
I'm Blair, Dorota's employer.
I have a few questions.
Just go with it.
Is only way.
I need to ask you how long her morning sickness will last.
As I'm naturally empathetic, the mere discussion of food Not to mention the odor, the taste It should ease off in the first trimester.
And what about breast sensitivity? Miss Blair! Is the one asking the questions.
You see, she practically screams when anyone touches them.
I can hear her all the way from queens.
Sensitivity's totally normal.
Okay.
And, um, how long till she can determine the father of her child? She's had a few one-night stands with the staff of our building.
Blair Cornelia Waldorf! You two should work this out.
Dorota can come back another time Alone.
I'm sorry.
I-I don't know what's come over me.
Yes, you do.
You are pregnant, too.
We are like sisters now! Cousins.
Distant cousins.
Miss Blair, why you not say you are do not utter the word.
No one must know.
Well, at least not until I have some time to figure things out.
I don't care what you say.
I hug you anyway for luck.
And keep secret.
I'm sorry.
It's not you I'm so sick of all you guys on antidepressants.
It's a good thing you don't offer satisfaction guaranteed, or she'd be your third refund this week.
Do you need pharmaceutical assistance? Yeah, I wish weed was the answer.
I meant Viagra.
No, everything works down there.
It's here that's the problem.
I just can't stop thinking about that woman from L.
A.
It's understandable, given your mother issues.
She called twice.
She did? Did she leave a number or at least her name? Last I heard, it was Anne Archibald.
Yeah, well, in an attempt to take some of your advice about my future, I asked my mom if she could help me get an internship this fall.
Schumer and Lloyd Blankfein at Goldman are both interested, and now she wants me to choose.
So call your mommy.
Pick either job.
Forget about your mysterious lady from L.
A.
If a woman wants to see you again, she generally tells you her name.
What happened to the son helping the father make breakfast? You've been on that computer since you got here.
I know.
Sorry.
I'm I'm trying to figure out which publisher has my book so I can stop it from coming out.
And Jeremiah Harris wasn't any help? No, no, the only clue I have is this, uh, check Vanessa sent me.
I'm sorry.
I'll be one more minute, and then I will be in there to burn the bacon, I swear.
Hey! Hey.
Um, listen, I know you're probably on your way to surf or hanging out at Cameron Diaz's house, but, uh, I was wondering if you could share some of your bank breaking secrets with me.
Well, I thought you did all your scheming with Blair.
No, she's not speaking to me.
I just need, um, to help Vanessa with a bounced check, and I can't reach her.
I was thinking that, you know, whatever you did to get into lily's safe deposit box might also work for me.
Oh, well, that was all Chuck.
He slept with the girl at the bank.
But knowing him, there are many more girls at many more banks.
You should ask him.
Right.
Chuck.
Okay, thanks.
So are you really staying out there? Well, I got a great job, and Charlie's here.
Char-Charlie as in "Call me Serena" cousin Charlie who moved back to Florida? Yeah, who's actually been living in L.
A.
one and the same.
I'm about to go to brunch with her and make her fill in all the blanks.
Well, don't be too quick to option her life rights before you make sure she's back on her meds.
But in all seriousness, tell her I said hi.
Bye.
And for my final course, a hot peach clafouti, inspired by my hot girlfriend Ivy.
Aw.
Mmm.
Oh, three Michelin Star, definitely.
Which of these scream "I am a New York City trust fund baby" more? Uh those, I guess.
You okay? You seem extra nervous about this audition? Yeah.
Some days it's just not as much fun trying to be an actress.
Well, at least we're failing together.
Unlike Jason he just got this huge chef gig at beast in Portland.
Hey, it's cheap, too.
Moving there could end my days of plating salad with dressing on the side and save you from using your mysterious emergency fund.
Max, I told you, this is my last resort.
There's only enough to use it once.
I know.
It's just, I don't want to end up like everybody else who comes to L.
A.
with dreams only to find that L.
A.
Is the place where dreams come to die.
Or you get those weird lips that everybody here has.
Let's not give up yet.
I promise things will get better.
I wish you could join me for the feast.
The church celebrates with all of Monaco's favorite foods.
To honor virgin mother honest rise to heaven.
Uh why aren't you waiting to greet princess Beatrice at the elevator? I know you two will love each other.
Don't be so sure.
My first impression on grimaldi women thus far has been abysmal at best.
Unlike grimaldi men who fall in love the moment they see you, but don't worry.
My mother and Beatrice never agree on anything.
They make the brothers of Brunei look civil.
At least we don't have harems.
Ah, la voila.
Louis Me, too.
Beatrice, this is Blair.
You are even more beautiful than the photographs in the paper.
Mm.
The perfume It's Jasmine and clove oil from Africa.
Do you like it? It's powerful.
Then I shall give you mine.
I'll get more when I go back.
I've always longed for a sister.
Sit, sit.
Tell me everything.
Okay, Spill.
What are you doing in L.
A.
And how did you get your mom to agree to let you come here? She didn't.
I call her and I tell her that I'm okay, but not where I am.
Trust me, it's better this way.
Florida was making me crazier than New York ever did.
And you're being responsible with your medication? I needed a break from my mom, not reality.
Well, Florida's loss is my gain.
Okay, I wanna know everything! Friends, boyfriends.
Neither, honestly, which is why it's so sad that you have to go back to New York for school.
Well, then I must be a genie, 'cause your wish is granted.
I'm staying.
Um I thought that your movie ended.
Oh, it did, but the producer offered me a job, so I'm meeting with her later today to discuss the details.
But don't worry.
We'll have plenty of time to catch up before then.
They say misery loves company, but sometimes it's the company that makes you miserable.
Mm! My.
Look at the time.
I'm so disappointed that I can't spend all day with you before you rush off to your principality.
You know, Blair, I feel just the same, which is why I moved our flight to this evening.
We now have all afternoon to share our secrets like real sisters, and I want to know them all.
Mm.
I can't wait.
Now if you'll excuse me.
But nothing's worse than company that overstays their welcome.
Good luck, B.
Have fun being the hostess with the mostess.
I get working for this producer's a huge opportunity, but what about Columbia? Well, I'm taking the semester off, and I'll see how things go after that.
My only issue is living with Cece.

  Last night, at 2
0 A.
M.
, her bridge game turned brutal.
A neighbor even came and complained.
Well, I'm sure your real estate agent will find you a great place.
Well, hopefully near you.
In fact, why don't I have her just meet us at your place? It's a bad idea.
My roommate barely lets me in most days.
And he's kind of Howard Hughes-ish.
Hey, I was just about to call you.
I'm gonna need to see 2-bedroom apartments instead of one.
Okay, great.
Thank you.
No, my place is fine.
No, it's not negotiable.
This is L.
A.
Rhodes girls have to live together.
It's tradition.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hey, Chuck.
Ignore him.
He's not with me.
Oh, hey, hey, do I need to call the cops? This isn't what we signed up for.
We're outta here.
Just I expect a full refund.
What are you doing? You okay? I was until you arrived.
Uh, you don'tyou don't look all right there.
No, no, I have the address.
I just need her name, okay? Th-then why are you called "information," huh? I'm not Serena, Humphrey.
I didn't need saving.
Hey.
I thought you were still in the Hamptons.
I'd ask you how your summer's going, but seeing you with Chuck, I guess the answer is probably "weird.
" Oh, it gets weirder.
I found him paying some really rough dudes to to fight him.
He wasn't forthcoming with the details, but I I would imagine it's some new bass-type scheme to get Blair's attention.
Well, he said he was okay about her all summer.
Or maybe it's finally hitting him now that we're back.
I think something else might have hit him, too.
He was already pretty bruised when I got there.
I think he might need to see a doctor.
Yeah? Well, my mom has this concierge doc she could send, but calling her means I'd have to decide which internship I want.
Well, I could stick around and talk it through with you.
I was also kinda hoping to get some help from Chuck on something anyway.
Hey, I'm gonna call a doctor, have him check out your bruises, okay? Excellent.
Listen, I'll just, uh, call you when the doctor leaves.
How about that? All right.
Well, what do you say to a little shopping for all your pre-wedding events? Yes.
I was thinking Wu for my welcome parade short but regal.
And Alaia would put Charlene and her swimmer's body to shame at Albert's ball.
Hmm.
Those will never do.
Why? They only use children to sew the beading.
You cannot have bare shoulders, exposed knees, anything form-fitting.
Too much skin borders on Bruni.
I-I-I don't understand.
How am I to become an icon of Style and taste if I can only wear a burka? I'm sorry.
The dress code is mandated.
So you get Balmain, and I get to be Barbara Bush.
How is this possible? It's one of the many perks of being the non-reigning sibling.
I'm surprised to hear you say that.
I read the interview you did for "The Guardian" when Louis gave up his seat for me, and you seemed more than eager to step into that role.
I admit I've always wished for my mother to realize she had two capable children.
But those few days with the world watching my every move were too much.
You, however, are much better suited for the pressures of royal service than I.
Shall we have a snack? Ohh.
Actually, I need to find a restroom.
I'm not sure there's enough closet space.
You're kidding, right? I didn't think it was possible for anyone to need more closets than I do.
I mean, you have a whole room for your shoes alone.
Yeah.
But, you know, the the beach traffic can get really bad, and that might depress me even more than my crazy roommate, so maybe I should Just stay where I am.
So you're gonna give this place up because of traffic? Where in L.
A.
is Carmeggedon not an issue? I already have other interest.
If you want it, you're gonna need to move quickly.
Oh, I can give you a down payment right now.
Except I forgot my checkbook.
But you have yours.
I-I saw it when your purse fell.
Yeah.
But, you know, I don't think I have enough to cover two months' rent.
Unless you bought the Maldives without telling me, you should have plenty.
Or is this your way of telling me that you don't wanna live with me? Of course not.
All I have is an out-of-state check.
No problem.
Just put your local contact information in the memo.
See? I told you this would work out.
You understand fractured ribs aren't something to mess around with.
You could end up puncturing a lung.
I told you, they don't hurt.
I have a hard time believing anyone has that high a threshold for pain.
Yeah, well, he's probably just self-medicating.
You should see his medicine cabinet.
Some of that stuff's not even legal in Mexico.
No, I was just I was just kidding.
He claimed he couldn't feel my touching his ribs during the exam.
If he's taking that many drugs, someone needs to keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn't take any more or do anything other than rest.
His injuries are bordering on dangerous.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you.
I wish we'd stopped at Saint Honor.
Doesn't shopping leave you famished? Well, perhaps buying one lipstick doesn't build up the same appetite.
Lucky you can eat at your feast.
I'm sorry.
Too much coffee.
Give the virgin my regards.
I'll show you to door.
And by door, I mean elevator.
Over there.
I think it's fairly obvious.
Our future princess has developed a drug problem.
What? No.
Uh, Miss Blair too much control freak to use mind alter substance, even to help mood swing.
I admire your loyalty, but no one uses les toilettes so often unless they have something to hide.
Louis deserves to know what it is.
I swear, Miss Blair just Have sensitive stomach.
Of course.
I knew I recognized that faint acrid smell from boarding school.
The pale skin.
Not eating in public.
Blair's obviously bulimic.
Yes.
No.
I I mean, notnot anymore.
Only teenage habit of using restroom die hard.
But Miss Blair digest everything now.
I go make tuna melts for both of you.
Louis? We need to speak right away.
Hey! What are you doing in New York, at my house? Leaving, by the look of it.
Whoa, were you trying to find me? Oh, this is fantastic.
I haven't been able to stop thinking about you either.
Can't believe you actually tracked me down.
Oh, that is borderline adorable, but I wasn't here to see you.
As of recently, I own "The New York Spectator," and I wanted to interview your mother for my inaugural article on the disgraced wives of dirty businessmen, but she not-so-politely declined.
Okay, wait, even if this is a coincidence, it's a pretty damn good one.
All right? I was here just to discuss job offers with my mom, but I would much rather take you out.
Oh, we had fun, Nate, but I need more than just stamina to keep me interested.
Nice seeing ya.
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Will you at least tell me your name? What's so important it couldn't wait until our 7-hour flight tonight? Your fiancee is bulimic.
Is that all? Bulimia is a serious disease.
Blair told me all about her teenage struggles.
It's in her past.
Past hour.
She's not well, Louis.
Or she needs an escape from a shopping trip full of rules.
She told me about that, too.
I was just trying to prepare her for the pressures of your life.
The stress will be the worst thing for her condition, all so you can claim a title we both know you don't even care about.
You know I'll do whatever I have to to ensure Blair's well-being.
But believe me, she's doing great.
There's nothing to worry about.
You never did understand la psychologie des femmes.
I guess I will just have to prove it to you.
Go ahead.
I will prove you wrong.
Hi.
Yes.
This is Charlie Rhodes from earlier.
Turns out that Serena and I have changed our minds about the apartment, so if it's okay with you, I'd like to come back and get my check.
Miss Rhodes, your check was invalid.
The bank told me it was no good.
I'm sorry? I gave it back to Miss Van Der Woodsen when she brought me a new one.
Maybe you should speak to her about this.
Saltines only thing I eat for months with Ana.
Well, that was not the same.
Your people are bred to work through these conditions and give birth in a field.
No fields in Krakow.
And I have birthing suite at Lenox Hill.
Well, I am too exhausted to even reprimand your insubordination.
At least she and Prince Louis gone.
You have time to figure out don't even let the word leave your lips.
You never know who could be lurking.
Blair? Louis.
Darling.
Ah, I was just about to take a nap because I was so exhausted from that shopping trip.
So romantic of you to come and say a final good-bye.
Beatrice didn't want you to miss your first Monegasque holiday.
And that is so kind.
I'm sure the virgin will understand that I'm too busy to be away.
Which is why I had our priest arrange to celebrate here in New York.
He's already spoken to the local church.
I hope you're hungry.
It's called the feast for a very good reason.
Let's hope B's first feast of assumption doesn't end in damnation.
Back again? What don't you get? Unlike Serena, when I rejected you, I meant it.
Nate asked me to keep an eye on you while he was out.
And while I'm here, I was wondering if you could help me with something.
The answer is no.
And what did you do when the doctor said you're not supposed to go out? Well, if you're willing to fight me over it, we could strike a deal.
Well, that kinda defeats the purpose of making sure you don't get hurt.
There isn't a chance in hell you could hurt me.
Chuck, I know you saw the blast about Blair and Louis going to the event tonight.
It's not worth puncturing a lung to get her attention.
Blair's attention is the last thing on my mind.
Come on, man.
You do something dangerous.
"Gossip Girl" reports it.
Blair comes to your rescue.
Some might call that a pattern.
Humphrey, you know nothing about our situation.
Well, I do know that Blair is over you.
You weren't even the last one to kiss her before Louis.
I was.
While her lips may have brushed yours, the last person she was with before she left was me.
I'm referring to full carnal knowledge.
A kiss is just a kiss.
That hurt? Wish I could feel it.
Poor lonely boy, even on the outer boroughs of love.
Excuse me, ma'am, I think you were fired from this establishment.
I want to go to Portland.
If this is about your audition, you can't let one bad experience make you give up on your dreams.
My dreams will never come true if we stay here, but yours could if we leave.
I thought about it, and you were right.
Let's go before we're forced to leave.
Okay, if you're sure.
I'll tell the manager when she gets back from break.
Hey, this is gonna be good.
I can feel it.
We'll be like Bonnie and Clyde.
Without the killing and robbing and car chases.
I'm gonna go home and pack.
Okay.
I must have gained It's so delicious.
Louis.
Mon pre.
I am sorry we missed you at Cap d'Antibes this summer.
Well, your missionary work is more important.
Blair, this is Father Cavalia, the man who will marry us.
Bonjour.
How wonderful.
Well, I'm so sorry you can't be in your own church on this devout day.
Perhaps if you got on the plane right now, you could make it? Don't be silly.
This way, I have a chance to get to know you away from all my duties.
Did you enjoy a religious upbringing, Miss Waldorf? My family's of mixed faith, but I've always appreciated a confessional.
In fact, I'm gonna go find one right now.
As you know, the confessionnal is not available during a celebration.
Ah.
Gnial.
Have you ever tried a Barbagiuan? Mmm, my favorite.
It's filled with pumpkin and spices and butter.
Mmm, mmm.
It's delicious.
Alors, je vous laisse,  plus tard.
 plus tard.
I can't help it.
I love those.
Je vous salue, Marie.
Surely the virgin mother can show mercy to those on earth still suffering while she rises to heaven.
I-if you'll excuse me, I see a lost soul in need of guidance.
Thank you.
I will never question the paternity of your child again.
I told you.
She can't even keep down one bite of Barbagiuan.
You're starting to sound like mother.
But unlike her, who doesn't care about anyone but herself, I'm trying to save your fiance.
Why aren't you? Blair, hey, listen, I know you don't wanna see me right now, probably not ever, but I'm not here to cause problems.
I can't say the same about Chuck.
Have you seen him? Walk with me.
Well, thanks for coming back, Diana Payne.
Ah, you found the card I left for your mother.
Please tell me it was her who texted me to come back here and not you.
Oh, she's right inside.
So why are we out here? Her text said she'd relented and agreed to talk to me for my "Spectator" article.
She did.
There are just a few final details that need to be worked out first.
I know.
She has a concern that I'm turning the "Spectator" into a tabloid, but I'm very happy to give her story approval.
Wait, wait, wait.
What about me? I mean, I am the one who convinced her, after all.
I mean, don't you think there should be some sort of, you know, finder's fee? Are you trying to trade my interview with your mother for s*x? Well, I would've called it a date, but yeah, basically.
How do I know your mother's really inside? Well, you can watch me open the door and tell her that we'll be back in an hour.
What makes you think we need that long? Stamina.
Serena.
What are you doing here? I got your address off the check that the realtor gave me.
I'm sorry.
I Was a flake and forgot to look at my balance.
Okay, but you can just stop.
I know what really happened.
Out.
The princess needs privacy.
My security detail will escort any of you who are not willing to go out on your own.
Security detail? What's going on? Blair, I thought you were mad at me.
And you have my forgiveness if you shut up and guard the door.
It's not like you to forgive me or run away from a feast.
Might this have something to do with you sleeping with Chuck? How in the world did you know that? Forget it.
I don't even have time to care.
What don't you understand about "guard the door"? I can't believe that I thought you changed last year, and since you didn't, Chuck is now going off the deep end trying to get your attention again.
No, now that's where you're wrong.
Whatever he's doing isn't about me.
He was the one who told me to marry Louis, and he meant it.
Now you're gonna be sorry you didn't guard.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you gonna go with me in here? I'm not sure our friendship can handle that.
"Friendship" is a tenuous term.
Now be a gentleman and run the water.
Uh, I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to leave.
The Princess is getting sick.
Of course she is.
I'll bring her fianc right away.
I forgive you.
Are you happy? No.
I'm worried.
Are you bulimic again? No! I was just sick of listening to your inane questions.
Now I need to say a prayer for tolerance and get out there.
Eating disorders can return when people are stressed.
Clearly, Chuck is not the only one freaking out here.
The only thing freaking me out is that Louis' sister might notice I'm gone and get suspicious.
Why would you worry about her being suspicious if you weren't bulimic? Blair, this isn't a joke.
We are not leaving this room until you agree to get help.
I don't need help.
I'm not bulimic.
I'm pregnant.
While one mother's life leads her to heaven, another's is going straight to hell in a Moses basket.
Beatrice? You have to understand.
It's still so early.
I didn't wanna get Louis' hopes up if things weren't okay.
I was gonna tell him.
What were you going to tell me? About her wonderful idea, Louis.
I have so many.
You know, the one about inviting the homeless into our meal.
To dine with us? You're too modest.
I was telling Blair about our missionary work, and she suggested we share our meal with those less fortunate.
I think it's wonderful.
Of course.
Yes, not to have them eat with us but to serve them the food, like in a soup kitchen, with gloves on.
It's a wonderful idea.
SpottedChuck on the wrong side of town.
Looks like Bassman doesn't have enough of a dark side.
He has to take a walk on one, too.
Um I should go.
You promise you won't say anything? Yes, but you can't hide this forever.
I think you were right about her, Louis.
She'll make a perfect princess.
And you the perfect sister-in-law.
You know, I swear, I just took that checkbook in case of an emergency.
I didn't wanna use it.
Well, why not? It belongs to you.
It does? Yeah, your mom can't cut you off just because you leave Florida.
That's not fair.
I was actually gonna call her, but I was waiting till you got back.
I don't wanna involve her.
I'm the one who told her I wanted to make it on my own.
Besides, if she knows where I am, then she's just gonna try to make me come back.
That's true.
But you can't live here.
You have to come live with me.
I'd love to, but I can't afford it.
You can once grandma calls the bank and makes it impossible for your mom to cut you off again.
I don't think that that's such a good idea.
I don't wanna make her any more mad.
Well, she'll never find out.
Look, I explained to Cece how bad being around your mom is for you, and she doesn't wanna deal with Carol's wrath either, so she won't tell.
I don't know what to say.
I can't believe that you would do this for me.
You can show your gratitude by packing.
I have to go meet my boss, but I'll come pick you up after.
We Rhodes girls need to stick together.
Get him up!
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Again? Guys, come on.
You can't Hey! I'm not part of his payment plan.
Sorry.
Mr.
Bass said nothing should stop us except his safe word.
This is serious.
He could die.
"Though this be madness, yet there is some method in't.
" Guess that wasn't the safe word.
Chuck.
Chuck, tell 'em to stop.
Okay.
Fine.
Stop.
Let's go.
"Stop"? Really? That's it? I wasn't trying to kill myself.
Then what the hell were you doing? I was hoping it would hurt.
What, to--to dull the pain of losing Blair? That's what you don't understand.
I feel nothing when I see her and Louis or when I jump off a building or when I crash a motorcycle.
Even you don't irritate me.
Well, having these guys beat you up is not the way to try to feel something.
Youyou could have died.
Is being dead that much worse than being nothing? I still don't know how you got your mother to agree after she slammed the door in my face.
I just told her it was her chance to tell her side of the story and move on with her life.
And that it made her seem classier than Ruth Madoff.
Clever.
That's all it took? Well, I had to let her decide on my internship Goldman or Schumer.
Why do either? Well, like I said in L.
A, I need to figure out my future, and, you know, both are great options other people would kill for.
How about working for me instead? I'm not a journalist.
I'm not looking for you to be one.
The newspaper is just the cornerstone of what I hope is gonna be a new media empire.
Someone with your persuasive skills could be great at sales or marketing.
Once you know how to control information, you can do anything with it politics, banking, whatever.
While that sounds great, I would have to get my family to approve me pulling out of this other thing.
Well, just remind them what "George" did for J.
F.
K.
Jr.
See you at the office next week.
Watch out, Nate.
Looks like s*x play may not be the only game you're a pawn in.
So it looks like something called a conversion disorder.
People become blind, paralyzed, or unable to feel after experiencing a psychological trauma, I.
E.
, Blair leaving you forever.
It's a little like P.
T.
S.
D.
If you say so.
You should see someone.
Treatment involves trying to make the patient feel again.
That's what I was doing before you showed up.
Well, how about instead of pain, you try to feel good things? I could tickle you.
I'd rather hire someone else to do that, thank you, but it wouldn't work either.
Why don't we discuss why you needed my help before instead? Um I wrote a novel.
It was something I was working on for a while.
No one was supposed to see it, but then Vanessa found it and sent it to a publisher, so I need to find out which one so I can, uh, I can stop it from coming out.
Forgive me for stating the obvious, but isn't being published a writer's goal? Not for this book.
It's it's a scathing social satire about everyone I know, including you.
Return of Charlie Trout.
Hmm.
I need to get into Vanessa's bank account so I can see who's making the deposits before anyone sees what I wrote.
Well, just because I can't feel anything shouldn't mean everyone else has to endure a humiliation.
I'll help you.
Hi.
So Jason said we could crash with him and his roommates until we find our own place.
Max What's going on? I don't think I can go.
What are you talking about? It'll be great.
I even got us onion-flavored snacks for the road.
And these things.
What changed? Remember what you said.
This isn't giving up on our dreams.
It's just making them happen in a different place.
I'm sorry.
I just realized that what's making me unhappy in L.
A.
isn't L.
A.
It's you.
Where is this coming from? I love you.
I'm sorry.
I wish I could explain better, but I can't.
Just be happy and know that I never meant to hurt you.
How well do any of us really know each other? Even families have their secrets.
We were so close.
I could even see my mother's face as Louis gave away his title because his fiance was bulimic.
She would have never forgiven him.
It would have been perfect.
Why not just tell her Blair's pregnant? Please.
Nothing would make her happier than a grandchild by Golden boy.
I just have to find another way to get Louis out of Monaco for good so my mother will finally see I was the right choice all along.
Vengeance becomes you.
Thank you.
So how did your crazy roommate take it? It wasn't easy, but he'll be fine.
Well, maybe you should get further from him than just Santa Monica.
I'm sure it's okay.
Unless you found us a different apartment.
Mm, how about one on the Upper East Side? What are you talking about? Well, turns out my boss was only in L.
A.
for the movie.
So my meeting was about transferring her back to her New York office, and I want you to come with me.
Last time didn't work out so well.
Well, this time, you won't have your mom to worry about, and you'll have your trust fund and your family.
Cece wants us to stay with her in Montecito until we leave, and her house is huge.
You would love it.
Please.
All you have to do is say yes.
Why not? I think I'm done here.
They say blood is thicker than water.
But it's also a lot harder to clean up when it spills.
If I'd known any better, I'd think you're starting to like Brooklyn.
It isn't Brooklyn I'm here for.
You're the only person I can have a furtive, emotionally loaded conversation with right now.
How's Chuck? Uh, he's okay.
Sort of.
Long Freudian story.
How are you? Pregnant.
That makes it sound more real.
I had hoped denial would last longer as a coping mechanism, but breast tenderness and morning sickness made that impossible.
You know, you do have options.
And I've considered them all, but no matter what, this baby was conceived out of love, and I'm gonna keep it.
Have you not told Louis because it might be Chuck's? I only slept with him once.
I slept with Louis a hundred times.
He may be mild-mannered, but he's surprisingly virile.
So by the sheer law of probability, it must be his.
Well, except the definition of "probability" is "strong likelihood" not, uh, "known fact" haven't you read "The Power of Positive Thinking"? Put your giant intellect aside and just focus with me on wish fulfillment.
This is not that kind of situation.
Even Blair Waldorf cannot bend D.

A.
to her will.
I am about to marry a fabulous man Who happens to be a prince.
I can't be this close to having all my dreams come true only to have them yanked away by one transgression at a stranger's Bar Mitzvah.
Look, I know it's scary, but I think you should know who the father is, if not for yourself, then for the baby.
And what if I lose everything? You'll still have me.
Maybe it's not blood bonds that make us a family.
Perhaps it's the people who know our secrets and love us anyway, so we can finally be ourselves.

My meeting was about transferring her back to her New York office, and I want you to come with me.
You weren't even the last one to kiss her before Louis.
I was.
The last person she was with before she left was me.
There's not a woman in this room who didn't take some pleasure in your downfall, myself included.
How about working for me instead? The newspaper's just the cornerstone of what I hope is gonna be a new media empire.
I wrote a novel.
No one was supposed to see it, but then Vanessa found it and sent it to a publisher, so I need to find out which one.
But isn't being published a writer's goal? Not for this book.
It's a-- it's a scathing social satire about everyone I know.
Have you not told Louis because it might be Chuck's? I can't be this close to having all my dreams come true only to have them yanked away.
Look, I know it's scary, but I think you should know who the father is.
And what if I lose everything? by Smut subcentral.
de They say the only way to conquer your fear is to face what you fear the most.
You must walk into the belly of the beast And risk the possibility of failure.
But try to hide from the fear, and you risk it swallowing you whole.
Go away.
I'm preparing for my interview with "Hello!" magazine.
But doctor office call again.
They have test results.
Hang up, or I'll tell the reporter you're undocumented.
Hey.
We have problem.
Doctor's office call four times to say paternity test ready for pickup.
Miss Blair say she busy, but reading Grace Kelly biography all day is not busy.
Is denial.
When does Louis get back from his trip? Tonight.
And Miss Blair had promised us that she find out who baby daddy is before Prince Louis get home.
All right, I have a couple things to do this morning, but when I'm done, I will march her to the doctor's office myself if I have to.
Miss Serena, welcome home! Dorota, I'm so happy to see you.
We missed you so much.
I go tell Miss Blair you are home.
Okay.
Whoa.
That is not the look of a girl in an empire state of mind.
Last week at grandma's was great, but I don't know.
I think it was a mistake to come back.
Stop worrying about your mom.
Cece won't tell a soul you're here, and she promised to call my mom to make sure she doesn't say anything either.
But even if that's true, what about Blair or Dan or everyone else? I don't think they'll be thrilled to find out the psychotic freak is back in town.
Please, this place is a mecca for psychotic freaks.
Everyone goes off the rails at some point around here.
It's practically a rite of passage on the Upper East Side.
It's our version of a bar mitzvah.
Well, maybe for someone who's from here, but me You a Rhodes? You'll be fine.
Come on.
I suffer through mediocre s*x with an editor's assistant to find out who's publishing your book, and this is how you thank me? Chuck, you felt nothing after "Field of Dreams," so I'm taking it to the next level.
If that movie can't make you feel, then maybe this little guy can.
The only thing this mongrel makes me feel is disgust.
Take it back to the pound, or I will.
Sorry.
I have a meeting.
I gotta kill this book once and for all.
I have to see my old mentor Noah shapiro.
It'll take some persuading, but I think it'll help.
I have some knee pads in the bedroom if you need them.
I think simple conversation will do the trick, but thank you.
Whoa.
Who's this little guy? He's Chuck's new, uh-- drunken mistake.
Never sleep with a girl from P.
E.
T.
A.
What, did we have plans or something? Is that why you're here? No, no, I'm just here to wish you good luck on your first day.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Remember to walk the dog.
What, are you gonna keep him? Of course not.
Well, you should.
You might need a new buddy.
I won't be around much between school and my new job at "The Spectator.
" You do know this is not the kind of job you should get from a chick at a Hollywood party.
Diana's completely rebuilding the paper, and even though I'm only an intern, she says there's a lot of opportunity to move up.
Nathaniel, you and I both know the only reason this woman's hired you is so you can please her in the bedroom, not the boardroom.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to call Victor, get this thing out of here.
Mmm! Yum.
You're back! Yeah! Oh, I thought I'd lost you to the land of pole dancing classes and gluten-free foods.
I am back, and look who I brought with me.
Okay.
And why? She's hit a rough patch with her mother.
You know how that is.
I thought maybe she could stay in the guest room until we figure things out.
I'll allow it.
Welcome back.
Well, thank you for letting me stay at your place.
I love your apartment.
Oh, you should have seen the place I found Charlie living.
"Squalor" is too nice a word.
But now you have heated bathroom floors and the future Princess of Monaco as your landlord.
Speaking of which, B.
, where's your prince? Cologne for a charity event.
He'll be back tonight.
Which is why Miss Blair must be going.
Many things to do before he returns.
Like possibly find a new maid.
An employee with one child is annoying.
Two is grounds for termination.
Oh, my gosh.
Dorota, I forgot.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I must say, best part of pregnancy is knowing who father is.
Well Sorry to eclair and run, ladies, but I have an interview today, and I need to go over my talking points.
Wait.
No, no.
Does this mean you're not going to the Jenny Packham show tonight? We were finally invited to model together.
Well, as much as it pains me, I guess you'll have to storm the catwalk without me.
Bisous, mes cheres.
Now time to do thing you swore to Mr.
Humphrey you do before prince home.
If you mean shopping, absolutely.
See? I told you.
That went great.
Now that you've survived Blair, let's go talk to my mom.
I can go prime her first so it's not too big of a surprise.
You can unpack and have the car bring you there after.
She will welcome you with open arms.
You'll see.
So Dan Humphrey wrote an actual novel.
Yeah.
And I was confident you'd remain an epic disappointment.
Well, I never intended to publish "Inside.
" Somehow it fell into Simon & Schuster's laps anonymously, and since they're your publisher, I was hoping you could get the book killed.
It's a satire of my entire life and everyone I know, and if it's released, I'll be a pariah.
My, you turned out to be an even bigger coward than I thought.
The best way to make sure your book fades into oblivion-- leave it alone.
What, let it come out? Have you seen what's on the best seller list? Unless you're friends with Rizzoli and Isles or related to a bounty hunter, no one will give a crap about your world.
You'll be lucky if your book makes it into the remainder bin at strand.
Trust me.
Let it come out, and vanish.
Ready to go? Dan Humphrey, Alessandra Steele, my agent.
Nice to meet you.
You, too.
Um, well, if you really think it's best for me to do nothing, then that's what I'll do.
Thank you.
And please don't tell anyone.
Wait outside a second.
I need to call my old friend Jonathan Karp.
I should go.
I'm gonna be late for my panic meeting.
You okay? Yeah.
With Eric gone, it's pretty lonely.
I feel like all I do is play "Angry Birds" and grill Larissa for gossip.
Well, there's only one more month, and Serena's back today.
Ohh.
Mwah.
True.
It'll be so good to see her.
Carol, I am so glad you called.
I'm sorry I've been out of touch.
Have you heard anything from Charlie? No.
Why? Is everything okay? She's taken off, and I think she might be on the west coast, and mom's not returning my calls.
Have you spoken to her? A few times, but Serena's back from Los Angeles, so I'll see if she's heard from Charlie.
Serena was in L.
A.
? Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Listen why don't I fly up? It would be really good for me to be around family right now anyway.
Sure.
Come.
Um, I could definitely use the company.
And in the meantime, I'll let you know if I hear anything.
Okay.
Bye-bye, sweetie.
Did you pick up the test results? I'm just opening the door to the doctor's office.
I'd better hang up, though.
It's so rude to talk on the phone Hi.
Oh.
Turns out that the rumored U.
E.
S.
novel is fact, not fiction, and I have the inside scoop on who the author is.
Patience, pets.
Your answer's coming.
Right now the median age of this paper's readership is over 50, and its online presence all but nonexistent.
They don't even have an app, for God's sake.
So first course of business is rebranding.
That's why I'm having the paper sponsor the Jenny Packham party tonight.
Show we're a little more glamorous now that I'm here.
So where can I start? How about by making me scream? What? Right here with a full office? I mean, the staff might think you're playing favorites.
Besides, I don't like an audience.
Excuse me.
Can I have everyone's attention? You're all fired.
Don't bother cleaning out your desks.
Good luck.
All right.
Come on.
Hey, take a deep breath.
Let's open that bad boy.
What?! Here? The results of this test could alter the course of my life.
You want me to face that in front of pigeons and--and street vendors? You said yourself that the odds are in Louis' favor.
And he will be an amazing father.
But what if it's Chuck's? I know.
You're right.
I'll open it, immediately after my interview with "Hello!" magazine.
I can't face the press if I've just heard unsettling news.
I need to look like Grace Kelly, not Grace Coddington.
I have to manage some business of my own, but go do your interview.
I'll meet you back at your apartment, and we can open it then.
That is much more civilized Unlike your hair, Humphrey.
You look like a muppet.
Oh, the whole summer was amazing, but getting the job with Jane made it feel like it all happened for a reason, you know? I start setting up her New York office tomorrow.
Oh, that is so wonderful, sweetheart.
I am so proud of you.
By the way, have you heard anything from your cousin? I got a call from Carol this morning, very concerned.
I guess Charlie might have run away to Los Angeles.
Grandma didn't call you? So that's what she was calling about.
Look, Carol was cutting her off, and by the way, Charlie's 19.
So it's not like she's running away.
She's just leaving home.
I know, but your grandmother should not be lying to Carol.
After all, Charlie has had sade serious mental health issues.
Mom, I saw her myself.
She's fine, I promise.
Well, that's not for you to decide.
Carol is her mother, and I'm not gonna participate in deceiving her.
Sorry, Charlie, but it looks like your Upper East Side dream just turned into a nightmare.
When I interviewed Prince Louis for this article, he said that family's very important to you.
That's one of the many things he loves about you.
He said that? So what about the two of you? When will you be starting a family? Oh, well, that's a very personal question.
We can skip it.
Anyway, your fiance answered for you.
According to him, it's a long way off.
"Blair hasn't expressed an interest in being a mother yet, "and I'm nowhere near ready to be a father at this point in my life.
" Is it the translation? I'm quite sure it's accurate.
No.
I'm sure it is.
You have your answer.
Well, thank you for your time.
I'm sure the two of you will be very happy.
Alessandra, hi.
I'm, uh-- Dan Humphrey.
I'm good with names.
If you're looking for Noah, he's not here.
I just came by to grab some of his things.
Do you know when he'll be back? He won't.
Well, I really need to talk to him.
I confided in him a personal matter, and he--he might have-- he might have said something he wasn't supposed to say.
Yeah, I promise you, he doesn't have time for petty gossip right now.
His hands are full with the release of his new book.
Now if you don't mind, I have a lot to deal with.
He didn't mention anything about a book this morning when I saw him.
Nobody knew about it, not even me.
Noah submitted it secretly because he wanted his editor's honest reaction.
I would kill him if the book wasn't so brilliant, and I'm only on page 60.
It's called "Inside.
" Oh, hold on a sec.
Yeah.
The reservation's for tonight.
Club a steakhouse.
Ask Noah if he wants anyone else there.
Look, I will make sure that you get a signed copy when it's released.
It's about people your age.
You'll love it.
Poor Lonely Boy.
You just learned the true meaning of publish or perish.
Hey, Max, it's me, Ivy.
I think I made a big mistake.
I should have come with you to Portland.
So I, uh, got a bus ticket, and I'll see you as soon as I can.
I hope you can forgive me.
Hey.
What are you doing? I'm leaving.
I heard what your mom said.
Wait.
So you showed up at her place after all? But, Charlie, I can turn my mom around.
I'll go back there right now.
It's not your mom.
It's mine.
She doesn't want me in New York.
Being here is like a dream come true, but maybe she's right.
I don't belong here.
Just because you weren't born here doesn't mean you don't belong here.
I'm sorry, Serena.
Thanks again for everything.
Hey, um, if you really are leaving, could you do me a favor and, uh, return my tickets to the Jenny Packham show? It's Already bad enough that I canceled being a model so last minute.
I think that if I let my tickets go to waste, they'll never invite me back.
Of course.
It's the least I can do.
Thank you.
Call me from L.
A.
Disaster averted.
Andre Leon talley got everyone in a panic about leaking images of Jenny Packham's show on his Twitter tonight.
They were gonna cancel the party.
I suggested that no one be allowed to bring their cameras into the party or even their cell phones, and now the show's back on.
Care to celebrate? I'd love to celebrate.
In fact, I love celebrating with you as many times a day as possible.
But I'm just starting to wonder if that's all you hired me for.
And you know what? I think my mom could still get me the job with the senator.
Oh, you're not serious.
And why wouldn't I be? I came to work for you so I could establish myself outside of my family's influence.
Now if this just some big joke to you, I might as well take an internship that looks good on my resume.
This is no joke, and I'm sorry if I made you feel that way.
Sit down.
Do you know Walter McCreedy and his wife Nola? Congressman McCreedy? Of course.
I play squash with him at the club sometimes.
She's a famous socialite.
He's a hot young congressman.
They're gonna be at the show tonight.
I want an interview with them.
And since you fired all your actual reporters, you're willing to let me do this? This is how you learn.
Dorota, pick up my dresses at the tailor.
I'm going to the Jenny Packham party.
But you have date with Prince Louis tonight.
And Mr.
Humphrey on his way over to help with letter opening.
Mention that name again, and you'll be exiled to work the rest of your days in someplace horrible, like the Upper West Side.
You know what happens to housekeepers there.
The Zabars zombies.
Oh, excuse me.
I'm here to return Serena Van Der Woodsen's tickets.
Good.
You're here.
Come with me.
Oh, wait.
You don't understand.
Let me explain.
So this is the dress that you'll be wearing tonight.
We'll need to make some tiny adjustments, but that's what tape and pins are for, right? I'm sorry, but I think there's a misunderstanding.
I'm not Serena.
I'm just here to drop those off for her.
Right.
You're her cousin, Charlie Rhodes.
Have some champagne while you wait.
How about it, Charlie? One last Cinderella moment before you turn back into a bumpkin.
Hello, my love.
Put that depressing Russian literature down and get dressed.
I'm taking you out.
I wish.
I would do anything to go to a party right now, but don't let me stop you.
If you wanna go out, go out.
You're not the one under house arrest.
Neither are you.
You know all of those meetings I've been having with panic about the new album? Well, half of them weren't with panic.
They were with your lawyer.
I wanted to see if he could convince the judge to grant you an early release.
I just got the call.
You are officially a free woman.
Oh, my God.
Rufus, is this for real? deactivated an hour ago.
So I thought we could go to that fashion show to celebrate.
An actual event where I don't have to tend the bar myself, with people I'm not related to, and--and clothes I didn't order online? Mm-hmm.
Rufus, oh, you must really Love me, don't you? Very much.
Now hurry up and get changed.
Mmm.
An officer's gonna be here any minute to remove your monitor.
Oh.
Okay? Oh, my God.
Oh, wait.
Wait.
What about Carol? Her flight's gonna be here soon.
Text her.
Have her meet us at the party.
They say freedom comes at a price.
Better watch out, Charlie.
I think you're going to be the one footing this bill.
Noah Shapiro's trying to steal my book.
So he's doing you a favor.
Now you have nothing to worry about.
It just seems wrong.
There's nothing more boring than a sense of morality, Humphrey.
But since you seem to be so afflicted with it, you have two options.
Either you go tell Simon & Schuster and the world that Noah Shapiro is a credit-stealing liar, or you stay quiet forever and simply let it go.
Whatever you decide, do it already.
I might not be able to feel anything, but at least I'm not paralyzed.
Careful, Dan.
He who runs from the fear falls into the pit.
Looks like you're about to take a tumble.
Your phone.
Oh.
And not soon enough.
Blair Waldorf.
Uh, this belongs to one of the models.
Check it under the name Charlie Rho-- Excuse me.
I'm Blair Waldorf.
Where should I report for hair and makeup? Oh.
I was told you weren't participating.
Mm, now you're being told differently.
Keep up.
Right this way.
There's the congressman and his wife.
Just remember this is a lifestyle piece, so find out what restaurants they've been going to lately, you know, where they summered, that sort of thing.
Oh, and I heard that they just came back from Mykonos.
I'd love to hear more about that.
All right, perfect.
Jenny Packham wanted this to be a deconstructed fashion show, so instead of a runway, you'll be walking through the party with escorts-- either a professional model or a special guest like yourself.
Thank you, Joanna.
If you have any eligible Rockefellers or Whitneys, Charlie will take one of those.
I myself am fine with a model or a witty gay.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
What are you even doing here, by the way? I'm not so sure myself.
I feel a little like Alice in Wonderland.
Well, Manhattan will do that to a girl.
You'll be happy to know it never wears off.
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm leaving right after the fashion show, heading back to L.
A.
My mom doesn't want me to live in New York.
It's not worth fighting her about.
And how old are you again? It's just she has a few things she can hold over my head.
Don't you have a few things you can hold over hers? Yeah.
Actually, I do.
I'll bet.
She is a Rhodes, isn't she? I'm starting to realize that mothers have some of the darkest secrets of all.
Blair, you'll be escorted by Simon Doonan.
Why don't you come with me to meet him? And Chris Benz will be here any minute to escort you.
Forget what your mother wants, Charlie.
It's your life.
What do you want? Ah, restaurants.
Boulud Sud.
Walter loves brushstroke.
Yes, nice.
I never realized you were a journalist, Nate.
Well, neither did I until the opportunity presented itself, and I went for it.
Good for you.
Thank you.
So I heard you two just got back from Mykonos.
You wanna tell me about that? Um, you're mistaken.
I had to go to Athens on a congressional trip.
You b*st*rd.
I knew it.
Were you with her? We're at a party, Nola.
Calm down.
I don't care where we are.
That's it.
I'm done.
My lawyer will call you tomorrow, and you'd better not put up a fight, or I will release those photos to everyone in your district.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to bring up anything personal.
I had no idea what was going on.
And here I thought you were the nice one in your family.
Congressman.
Rufus and Lily Humphrey.
No phones? I like this party already.
Come on.
Let's take a lap, see who's here.
What's Lily doing here? Oh, I don't know.
What happened? What's she doing here? What's wrong? I was so excited to have my freedom back, I didn't think about what it would actually be like when it happened.
It's gonna be great.
The last time I was at a party like this, I was co-hosting it.
Now I'm here as a former convict.
You remember what happened at the pink party.
I mean, I'm sure that the judge was more forgiving than these people will be.
Maybe.
Lily, you have served your time with dignity and grace.
You've earned the right to move on to the next chapter of your life.
So if anybody here has a problem with that, they don't get to be a part of the adventure, okay? Ready? Okay.
Lily, so good to see you.
Jamie, wow.
How are you? You look so good.
Thanks.
I'm gonna get a drink.
Okay.
I'll catch up with you guys after the show.
See? That's her.
Charlie! What are you doing here? Please don't tell my mom that I'm here.
You can tell her yourself.
Blair, we need to talk.
Do you mind if I take over from here? Not at all.
Well, I mind.
Humphreys are not escort material.
Let's see if we can change that stereotype.
Dorota pieced this together.
Apparently, she's broken quite a few things in your home you don't know about.
Don't worry.
She swore she didn't read it.
What are you doing? Put that away.
Don't you have your own life to ruin? Actually, uh, yeah.
Yeah, I do, but for some reason, I'm here trying to help you.
You can't hide from this forever.
Why not? Apparently, fatherhood holds no appeal for Louis, and Chuck will always be Chuck.
If anything, I'm not hiding.
I'm facing the truth.
It doesn't matter what test results say.
I'm in this completely alone.
It doesn't matter about the implications for Chuck or Louis.
Don't you wanna know who the father of your child is? The only thing I want is to finish this fashion show sans outer borough escort.
You're right.
It's your problem, so why don't you take this? This is yours as well.
Did you not hear me? I said I don't want it.
Well, it's not mine, so take it.
No.
You got it.
Oh, B.
Your refusal to find out who's the father has made you cause one mother of a scene.
You knew if I asked Walter McCreedy about Mykonos it would cause a scene, but I just destroyed a marriage.
What's going on here? The truth is, I'm not interested in interviews with New York's elite.
I want their secrets and scandals.
Oh, aren't you a little late to that party? Gossip Girl has that covered.
For now.
So you arranged to have everyone's phones checked to get at least one story that you didn't already have? It'll never work.
When you try to use what you filmed, you'll be blacklisted.
Gossip Girl doesn't create scandal.
She just whispers about what's already out there.
And I would have told you that if you'd bothered to tell me what you were doing instead of using me.
I mean, you had everyone's phones taken.
Why didn't you just, you know, look at some of them? Nate, that's brilliant! And if we act fast, we can return them before anyone knows they're gone! Whoa, no.
This is a one-stop shop of illicit e-mails, incriminating photos, and s*x.
Are you sure you didn't work for news corp? Diana, just This is your idea, and it's a good one.
Don't doubt yourself.
It's not--I just think that, you know, maybe you should dip your toe into illegal activities before you, you know, just dive right into it.
If you want any real success, Nate, you need to take a risk once in a while.
You can stay and help me rebuild "The Spectator," or you can go home and call your mum.
I'm sure there's still a position in a senator's office somewhere.
All right, meet me back at the office in 20 minutes, not a minute later.
I can't believe you thought you would get away with this.
You don't understand.
Did you honestly think I wouldn't come looking for you when you wrote that check? Well, get changed.
I'm gonna tell Lily we're leaving.
It's time for you to go back to your real life like you should have months ago.
Actually I think I wanna stay.
It's not up to you, Ivy.
Yeah, it kind of is.
What are you gonna do about it? Call the police? I'd be happy to tell 'em the whole story about how you hired a struggling actress to pretend to be your daughter so that she could gain access to your real daughter's trust fund just so you could take the money for yourself? I think the authorities would have a problem with that, and your family would, too.
You wouldn't.
I came from nothing.
Everything here sparkles.
And that family that you can't stand has been kinder to me than my own family ever was.
I'm not walking away from that.
And if you try to take me down, Carol, you're coming with me.
Blair, I'm sorry.
I was totally out of line.
Truth is I think I've been using you to avoid facing some problems of my own.
I promised to hold your hand, but maybe I've been forcing it.
No.
I turned to you, Dan, because I knew you were the only one who'd protect me from my own worst instincts.
For what it's worth, when Georgina showed up on my doorstep and told me she was pregnant, I mean, the last thing I wanted to be was a father, but then milo was born, and I fell in love with him.
Chuck or Louis--it'll be the same for either of them.
And if I open that envelope Will you be able to hide from your problems then? I think if you have the courage to face your future, then I should have the courage to face mine.
There once was a Princess B.
, undone by the question "Who's the daddy?" But it's time to find out-- Will it be Chuck, or will it be Louis? I need to talk to you.
I thought we said everything we needed to say last time we saw each other.
Chuck Is this another misguided attempt by Dan to get me to feel something? I'm pregnant.
It's Louis'.
I I didn't want you to find out from someone else and wonder if the baby was yours.
That's very considerate.
Yes, well If I know anything about Chuck Bass, it's that fatherhood isn't part of the lifestyle.
You must have been very relieved when you realized you weren't carrying my offspring.
That certainly would have derailed your fairy tale.
This fairy tale is complicated.
Blair, meet my dog, Monkey.
But I saw "Gossip Girl.
" I thought you got rid of him.
I just sent him to get fixed.
I thought it was the responsible thing to do.
I should go.
Yes.
Louis is waiting for me.
Of course.
There is a part of me that really wanted it to be yours.
It's impossible, you know.
He's got to say to himself, "I'm a writer! I'm a writer!" He can hook up with a rookie.
All those people were just drinking themselves into the grave, you know? Noah.
Hey, uh, I need to talk to you.
Everyone, this is Dan Humphrey.
He was my inspiration for the character of Dylan hunter.
Isn't that right, Daniel? No.
You didn't write this book.
I did.
Bravo! He did it! I told you I'd get him to step forward.
I'm sorry.
Did you-- did you do this on purpose? Destiny is a scary thing to face.
We all need a little push.
You deserve to see what comes of it yourself, and you will.
This is elise and mark from s&s.
This is Jonathan Karp, your editor.
You already know Alessandra.
Sit.
Join us.
We've got a lot to talk about.
To my beautiful wife, her freedom, and the end of the ankle bracelet.
Oh, and to the return of my Alaia dresses.
How about we toast to second chances, for Lily and me? And, mom, thank you for understanding that this is where I'm meant to be.
Cheers.
Cheers.
You know, Charlie, Serena's room is empty, and you are welcome to stay here.
We'd love to have you.
No, no, no.
That-- that would be an imposition.
No, really.
Eric has only been gone a few days, and Rufus and I are already going through empty nest syndrome.
Yeah, making breakfast for two feels so wrong.
I would love to.
Being around family would mean a lot to me.
Great.
Okay, well, um I'm gonna go crash in the guest room.
I have an early flight.
What are you talking about? It's only 9:00.
You should go out.
We could all go out.
Maybe--maybe another time.
I'm sure I'll be back again soon anyway.
Hey.
So I'm gonna make sure that Cece reinstates your access to my trust.
You are on your own now.
Good luck.
The true author of a tell-all tome has been revealed, and the author's name is one everyone will recognize, but the question is, will anyone want to say it again once the book is out? You're pregnant.
You're pregnant.
Oh, you're happy.
But your "Hello!" magazine interview-- I heard your answers.
I-I just said those things to protect you.
I knew if I even hinted at wanting children, you would be under constant baby watch.
The press would never leave you alone.
You did that for me? You really are a prince.
A very happy prince.
The truth is, I can't wait to be a father.
And now I'm going to be one.
Let's go celebrate.
Where would you like to go? Oh, someplace with souffles.
My morning sickness is gone.
I know a place.
They closed an hour ago, but they'll reopen for us.
Face your fears, and the rewards can be profound.
You could discover the true depth of a relationship.
Or what you're capable of withstanding.
I'm so happy you're here.
You know, I don't think I realized until I saw you in L.
A.
how much I needed family around or how much you needed me to help you shop.
What are you looking for over there? My phone.
I think I left it at the fashion show when the assistant checked it in.
I totally forgot.
Well, I'm sure they still have it.
We'll call in the morning and find out.
The problem is, the more you gain People trust their phones way too much.
The more you stand to lose.
There's just this, uh, one phone that didn't have a tag on it, so I didn't put it back.
You know whose it is? Maybe someone at coat check? Do you know someone called Ivy? Get ready to find out what you're made of, because to survive on the Upper East Side, you better be fearless.

Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Ivy, stop talking to your boyfriend and start working.
Charlie! Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here? "The Beautiful and The Damned" wraps in a week, but how would you like to keep working for me? I would love to.
What are you looking for over there? My phone.
I think I left it at the fashion show when the assistant checked it in.
I'm not interested in interviews with New York's elite.
I want their secrets and scandals.
You had everyone's phones taken.
Why didn't you just, you know, look at some of them? Do you know someone called Ivy? The truth is, I can't wait to be a father, and now I'm going to be one.
I never intended to publish "Inside.
" Somehow it fell into Simon & Schuster's laps.
It's a satire of my entire life and everyone I know.
You didn't write this book.
I did.
Bravo! He did it! I told you I'd get him to step forward.
Dan Humphrey, Alessandra Steele, my agent.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

Gossip Girl.
It's brilliant.
Really exceptional.
Loved the book.
Do I know you? Any of you? Do I know anyone here at all? The ending Just slays me.
Slays me how you're all alone with no friends left Surrounded by people who think they know you but really don't.
It's genius.
Right, but, uh, it's not me.
It's the character Dylan Hunter.
The book, is, uh, the book is fiction.
Well, I'm happy to tell you it's a brilliant piece of fiction that's number 38 on the Amazon pre-order list.
Quick question.
How big can my head get before it explodes? Half the buys are probably upper east siders dying to see if they're in it.
Yeah.
Some of my friends might feel they are.
They're coming tonight, right? To the book party? No.
I haven't exactly mentioned it to them yet.
Um, I'd have to tell them the book exists first.
They don't know? Not any of them? No.
And I'm not sure they're gonna like it when they find out.
If they're really your friends, they'll be happy to see your star rise, and they should be at the soire tonight when everybody learns that "Anonymous" is actually Daniel Humphrey.
I'm gonna need six copies of this book, uh, that should probably be hand-delivered.
I'll see you later at Giorgio Armani for your suit fitting? And don't shave.
Makes you look like a real writer.
I now understand why women used to go into confinement.
It wasn't because of modesty but vanity.
Look at my boobs.
Oh, I'm huge.
Are you even listening? - Sorry, darling.
I was just reading about how some pregnant women have mood swings.
Apparently, they didn't know you before the pregnancy.
Oh, you look gorgeous.
I can't wait to tell the whole world the good news.
Me, too.
My mother and Beatrice arrive tonight.
And I asked my mom and Cyrus to join us for dinner at the Consulate.
And then we'll tell everyone together.
You don't think your family is gonna be upset, do you? I don't want them to think of me as the star of some trashy MTV show like "Unmarried and pregnant Princesses" or, I don't know, "Royally Screwed.
" My mother will be over the moon.
The job of any princess is to provide an heir to the kingdom.
And that is exactly what you are doing.
An heir to a kingdom lives within me.
How very Shakespeare.
A comedy, not a tragedy, I hope.
So do I, which is why I have to tell one person before we meet up with the families.
.
And I can do that right now.
Yeah, we received the latest draft.
It's on Jane's desk.
Okay, I'll have her call you.
Thank you.
Morning, everyone.
I'm on a juice fast this week.
Not going to be pretty.
Um, I will put those in the fridge for you.
I'll also request an extra cashew drink.
It makes the day bearable.
Thank you.
List.
Yes.
The coverage you wanted on the Krakauer galley is on your desk, as well as the new spec script that Sony won in the bidding war.
What is it again? "American Psycho" in prep school.
Make it go away.
Also, um, I know that it's a long shot, but I sent Daniel Day-Lewis "The Blue Rose," along with a note and a rosebush that only grows in Ireland.
I don't know.
I thought it might be a special touch.
Daniel never agrees to do anything.
The man took three years to make a pair of shoes.
But I like that you're putting it out there.
Sam? Yes? Could you get me and Serena two green teas? Yeah, sure.
Happy to.
I knew that my instincts were right hiring you.
You're a smart cookie.
You can look at your phone.
I don't run a gulag.
Thank you.
That's Piper Van Allen.
And that's Sullivan Baker.
And I care about their PG-13 pictures because 'Cause Piper is married to Jason Van Allen.
Oh, well, I am slightly more interested.
Yeah, and Sullivan's with that celebrity florist guy.
I think they got married in Amagansett this summer.
Oh.
That's a twist I wasn't expecting.
Yeah.
Well, our phone swipe at the Jenny Packham Show gave us some pretty good stories.
Yeah, but pretty good isn't perfect.
If only we had Blair Waldorf's phone.
I told you, she's my friend.
My friends are off-limits.
Oh.
Morals.
How quaint.
I mean, why do you even hold on to that phone if you're not gonna answer it? Because I don't have to explain how I got it.
But I am too intrigued by our mysterious "Ivy" to just toss it away.
Well, we could always lie, say we found it on the street.
How are we gonna find her? Look.
There are no names in the phone, only numbers.
And there was no tag for her at the party.
Well, maybe she was just a crasher.
You know, a nobody.
Mm.
Nobodies don't hide their friends.
They advertise them.
I have a feeling about this girl.
Wait, hold on.
I know that number.
Yeah? All right, well, I'll be back in a bit, hopefully with a new lead.
Your call has been forwarded to an automated Still haven't found your phone? No, and I've been calling it nonstop.
Well, maybe it's time for a new one.
New city, new cell phone.
Hmm? Yeah, but my whole world's in that phone.
Final mix of Panic's debut album.
This is so exciting.
Yeah, it's been a long time coming.
Do you ever regret not getting back into music sooner, Rufus? Nah.
No, I wouldn't give up raising my kids for anything.
I mean, I love music, but Dan and Jenny, they're my life.
Okay, everybody ready? Maybe that's Dan.
I was hoping he would join.
Good boy.
Hello.
Do you know what this summoning is about? I do but I can't say.
I'm sworn to secrecy.
Since when do you bite your tongue? I'm learning.
Well, isn't Humphrey becoming quite the Drama Queen? - Isn't that usually your role? - I prefer Drama Princess now.
How are you, by the way? I'm okay.
Thanks for asking.
Sorry.
Squirrels.
Shall we? What are you guys doing here? We must have all gotten the same text from Dan.
The last time he was this secretive, he showed up with a baby.
Don't worry.
You're not about to become a grandfather, though Dan is about to give birth in another way.
Okay, I'm pretty sure this is how every murder mystery begins.
Serena, how was your job? - Really great, actually.
So great she has no time for me.
Well, I would if you weren't asleep every time I got home.
Uh, I'm still jet-lagged.
Haven't you been home for weeks? It certainly feels that way when I'm around you.
Serena, quick question.
You don't happen to know a girl named Ivy, do you? Uh, I don't think so.
Why? Oh.
Well, I found her cell, but I don't know how to get it back to her.
Your number was in her phone book.
What's her number? I'll dial it.
Look! Here's Dan.
Hey, everyone.
Thank you so much for coming.
I only have five minutes.
This better be really important.
What is this all about? - Is everything all right? - This isn't about me, right? - Yeah, what's going on, Dan? - This is going to be fun.
I'm sorry to call everyone here on such short notice, but, uh All right, you know how there's been all this speculation about the book that's being published by an anonymous author? Yeah.
Gossip Girl said it was about us.
Yeah, it was probably written by some loser who doesn't even know us.
Well, not exactly.
I am that loser.
I wrote it.
And it is based on you, sort of all of you.
Looks like it's going to be a hot time in this old town tonight.
Let's just hope lonely boy and his book don't go up in flames.
Hey.
What are you doing? I thought you were waiting downstairs.
I'm tired of waiting.
When are you gonna tell them? Soon.
I promise.
"Soon" isn't soon enough.
It's time they all knew about us.
What's so funny? I think you should ask Dan.
Well, I might've made your character a little Gay.
I hope that's okay.
Stop enjoying this so much.
You wanted me to feel something.
That's a feeling.
Do I have game? - Oh, definitely.
I'm cool with that.
I know it's gonna be a little weird with everyone reading characters inspired by themselves, but I wanna make it clear This book is a work of fiction.
And after you read it, I hope that you'll feel good enough about it and me that, uh, you will come to this book party tonight.
The publisher is announcing that I'm the author.
So Yeah.
Of course we'll be there.
Well, read it first and then decide because I You know, I didn't have a lot of time to make changes, and there are some instances where it's not exactly how I would've wanted it.
Well, an artist never feels his work is perfect.
But it's good to always strive for more.
I am so proud of you, son.
I am gonna cancel my whole day with panic just so I can savor your book.
So now that this unnecessary meeting about America's future doorstop is adjourned, do you wanna go grab a cup of decaf? Oh, I would love to, B, but I'm already late for work.
I gotta get back.
Well, maybe after work then? If this is about the book, don't worry.
Everyone loves a villain.
I wouldn't say there's a villain, per se.
Well, I can tell you who isn't.
Come on.
Every girl needs to be knocked off her pedestal a little.
Can't handle that kind of pressure.
I'll see you later.
Um, you know that story I wrote that Louis killed? It's in the book? Yeah, I figured.
But if it's all the same to you, I think I'd like to stay in the dark about just how nastily you've portrayed me.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
I mean, you know, we're just recently friends again.
Why ruin a good thing? Yeah, and, uh, I'm sorry in advance, but I have a better offer than your party tonight.
Louis and I are telling our families our news.
Good luck.
You, too.
Your novel seems to be, uh, very Yeah.
I'll, uh, I'll be right over.
Bye.
A book written about you guys.
It sounds exciting.
Well I hope he wasn't writing it when I went nutso last year.
Trust me, there was enough insanity around before you even got here.
So You and Serena were talking about a girl named Ivy? I think I met someone at the Jenny Packham Show with that name.
Can I help? Actually, yeah.
I was just hoping to find her and give her phone back.
I think she was with one of Lily's society friends.
Maybe we could look through her phone contacts, jog my memory? I left it at the office, but yeah, I could do that.
Do you happen to remember what she looks like? Hmm.
Blonde Boobs Botox? That pretty much describes everyone at the event.
If I saw her, I'd probably recognize her.
What'd I miss? Uh, Nigel Kirstein called for you, and we got an advance copy of this new book by some anonymous New York insider, and everyone in town is trying to figure out who.
Well, I know who.
I used to date him.
Shut up.
No way.
You're "Sabrina"? The dreamy blonde with the legs.
I guess I am.
Hi, uh, this is Serena Van Der Woodsen returning.
Yeah, I'll hold.
Did you actually have cases of champagne delivered to your school? Is that what he wrote? No, a friend was pulling a prank on me.
But it happened? That was in high school.
Keep reading.
You'll see I mature as he gets to know me better.
Hey.
Oh, no, it's great to hear from you, too.
What? Daniel Day-Lewis responded to my letter about "The Blue Rose"? Himself? Yeah.
No, of course.
Okay, thank you so much.
What was that? That was his manager.
They wanna set up a conference call to talk about the project.
I have to tell Jane right now.
Oh.
Dylan Hunter said everything comes easy for you.
Keep reading.
I told you.
I'm almost through.
So I was thinking "Pierre" maybe if it's a boy, since it's a Grimaldi family name.
Why not "Charles"? It's a name that seems to have special significance to you.
What? Louis, is something wrong? I know you were with Chuck.
Is that who you needed to tell our news to? No.
It was Serena, and I didn't even get a chance to.
Dan gathered us all together because he wrote some novel about everyone, and he wanted to make sure we knew about it first.
But the way he said he made you in that story If there's an entire book, it could be terrible.
I would expect nothing less.
I was mean to him on the steps of the met.
I bad-mouthed him repeatedly to his dream girl.
I tried to undermine him at "W.
" I'm sure he's brutal.
Look, he may be calling this a novel, but I know just how little imagination he really has.
It's a memoir masquerading as fiction like a reverse James Frey.
So you're going to read it? No.
No.
And you shouldn't either.
Look that book has nothing to do with us and the family we're building.
Whatever's in there, even if it is the truth, it's in the past.
Now if you'll excuse me, this baby of yours is making me so tired, I need to lie down.
Still nothing? The woman I met's not even in the background anywhere.
Maybe she's a ghost.
Well, at an Upper East Side event, we just call them first wives.
Nate, can I see you for a minute? Uh yeah.
Sure.
I'm sorry.
You know, I can leave.
It's fine.
I only need a minute.
I'm Diana, by the way.
So I gathered.
Charlie.
Hey.
Who is that and why is she in my office? Charlie Rhodes, all right? Serena's cousin.
And she said she met a woman named Ivy at the Fashion Show last week.
I don't care who she is.
We can't have strangers in here going through our photos.
You should know better.
Listen, she's trustworthy, I promise.
I don't care.
Get rid of her.
I'm sorry.
I Wasn't any more help.
If I remember anything more about her, I'll let you know.
It was really nice to meet you.
I've heard so much.
I'll see you.
Bye.
Thanks for letting me hang here, man.
I'm rather enjoying watching you squirm.
Scotch? - It's, like, 2:00 P.
M.
Valium then? I'm guessing my dad is, uh, probably halfway through and Nate's probably still on page 20.
I wonder if they're gonna be upset with me.
Alessandra said it isn't that scathing.
An I am I'm harshest on myself.
I hope they can see that.
Come here, buddy.
Stop whining.
You're not the first person to use the world around them for inspiration.
Didn't your dad get temporarily famous singing about Lily? Yeah, but my book isn't a love song, you know? Why aren't you mad at me? Your character dies accidentally, but it's not a it's not a happy ending.
On the contrary although clearly fiction.
I've never use a belt.
I'd use a Shahtoosh scarf.
Much softer.
Well, let's hope everyone else shares your point of view.
All success comes at a price.
The artist must stand alone to observe the crowd, right? It's funny.
Vanessa said the same thing.
Hey, dad Really? Great.
You're coming.
All right.
Uh, you know, I have another call but.
.
but I'll see you tonight.
Okay? All right.
Hello? Seems like things are looking up for lonely boy.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
It means a lot that you're coming.
Let's hope they've actually read the book and not judged it by its cover.
How is it I can sleep for two hours and still be so exhausted? Louis, are you sitting here by yourself? I was just, uh, waiting for you to wake up so I could tell you the bad news.
My family is not going to make it.
There is a terrible storm over the Atlantic that has delayed their trip.
I'll let my mom and Cyrus know.
We can tell them tomorrow when Sophie and Beatrice arrive.
If they make it by then.
Well what do you want to do tonight instead? Shall I make a reservation for Gramercy Tavern? I have some work to catch up on.
Why don't you go to Dan's book party? I'm sure he'd love to see you.
Okay.
Louis just lied to me about his family.
How you know? My outfit for tonight's announcement included a pair of crocodile Alaia's, and you can't wear such a beautiful shoe if there's even a hint of sprinkle outside.
So of course I checked the weather.
Clear from Monaco to Manhattan.
Maybe have something to do with lonely boy book.
Louis was reading while you sleep.
He did not look happy.
I told him not to read it, it's not like there's anything in it that he doesn't know about me.
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna kill Dan Humphrey.
Oh, God, the R.
S.
V.
P.
S are rolling in! The literary world is saying "yes" to you.
To "Anonymous.
" Let's hope they're still interested when they find out he's me.
They will be.
That and dying to know who you based the characters on.
We'll want to get a photo of you with all your friends tonight.
That way, people can play the guessing game of who's who.
You know, I don't know.
I'm not sure that they're gonna want to To be the lead photo on "New York Social Diary"? They wouldn't all be coming if they didn't want to support you.
Well, not everyone's coming.
Blair's not.
Yes, she is.
She just R.
S.
V.
P.
'D.
it's right here.
Blair Waldorf, no plus-one.
Really? 'Cause she told me herself that she So, my ex in Scott Rudin's office called.
Apparently, everyone is talking about the book that your friend wrote and your character in it.
Oh, I told him that you're Sabrina.
I hope that's not a problem.
No, not at all.
It's nice to play such a big part in Dan's book.
We've always been so close.
Ugh! He must've been a Saint to put with you that long.
Remind me never to start a juice fast the day we talk to Daniel Day-Lewis.
Uh, your pineapple mint's on the desk.
Better.
Let's seal this deal.
Jane Bettinger's office.
Serena? Yeah.
Hi, Nigel.
It's me.
I'm putting you on speaker with Jane now.
Daniel's manager.
We're going to need to postpone the meeting.
Sorry for the short notice.
Uh, hold on a minute.
I need to hop on another call.
Huh.
I wonder if this has anything to do with you being in that book.
D.
D.
L.
is notoriously anti-anything scene-y.
What are you talking about? Oh, well, there's this novel going around town with a character based on Serena.
"Sabrina" is a totally shallow, self-obsessed party girl.
Yes, uh, I finished it.
Aren't you being a little reductive? And ridiculous.
Daniel lives on a farm in Ireland.
His cow's probably giving birth right now, and everything isn't about Serena.
Sorry about that.
I'm afraid right now is not a a good time for Daniel to be looking at this particular project.
Wait.
I'm sorry.
You're passing? Sorry, Sabrina.
Movie business.
It's all about timing.
Cheers.
Did he just say "Sabrina"? Did you spend extra time doing your hair tonight, Nathaniel? Ha ha.
I don't mind that Dan made me gay.
I know.
I was actually a little offended he didn't make me gay.
Personally, I thought you'd be more annoyed at being conflated with Eric.
You didn't read it, did you? What do you mean by conflated? Your character is two years younger than everyone else and is best friends with the narrator's little sister Frankie.
In fact, the only thing I think you share is Lacrosse and a good political pedigree.
What's my character's name again? Derek.
What took you so long? I got your text, and I came right over.
What's wrong? I can't believe you told everyone.
It was supposed to be our secret.
You're the one who wanted it kept secret, not me.
I have a life future plans, and you can't just screw this up.
I didn't mean to.
You have to understand.
There is nothing between us Not then, not now.
Nothing.
I don't believe you.
Do you believe me now? Can we dare believe? Queen B.
And lonely boy doing the deed? Even I have to admit it's a novel idea.
Dan! What are you doing here? I'm supposed to be here.
It's my party, isn't it? Yes, but when it's your party, you arrive late, and the later the better, especially because we want a big frenzy around the reveal that you are "Anonymous.
" I need to put you somewhere no one will see you.
So I'm supposed to just hide in here? Yeah, you can sign books while you wait.
And do not come out until I tell you.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
No, no, it was me.
I wasn't looking.
I'm on my way to an event.
Is it drinks with me? I wish I could say it was, but it's a family thing.
Come on.
What sounds more fun? Your family Or a dirty martini with a stranger? Well, a martini or two could be nice.
Flighty? Irresponsible? I'm gonna kill him.
Whoa! I'm sorry.
Yes, you are.
Oh, I am so sorry Nate couldn't come.
Not as sorry as Dan's going to be.
Wonder where he is.
Hi.
I'm Alessandra, Dan's agent.
You must be his dad.
It is a pleasure to meet you, Mr.
Humphrey, and you, Mrs.
Humphrey.
Oh, you can call me Lily.
And this is Sloane Crosley, the best-selling author of "I was told there'd be cake.
" Which I am still in search of, so if you'll excuse me.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Where is the man of the hour? He's early to everything.
I'm hiding him.
He'll be out soon.
And you must be Mr.
Charlie Trout.
I have been dying to meet you.
Care to join me for a drink? You know, I just saw Graydon.
Maybe we should go say hello.
Nice meeting you.
Ciao.
I was nervous you wouldn't show up, considering your portrayal in the book.
Why would I be upset? I don't know.
Your character's story is so tragic, even before he dies.
And the way it happens all I could think was how long you must have been hanging there before anybody found you.
I have plenty of staff.
They would have found me immediately.
Staff? Not friends or family? Makes it even worse.
Hello? Hi.
I'm looking for an Ivy Dickens.
Yeah.
This is sh - She? I figured as much.
Don't bother lying or hanging up.
We met this morning when you were Charlie Rhodes.
Remember me now? Hey, do you know where Dan is? Can you believe what he wrote about me? Which part? Sabrina is glamorous, sexy, beautiful.
Selfish, insensitive, shallow.
Let me tell you, from experience, everyone loves a villain.
Yeah, I told Blair the same thing, but then I realize if that's true, why are you always alone? Not one word.
Have you seen Dan? No.
Have you? Did you see what he wrote about me? No, I didn't have time to read all of it, just the parts about me.
Me, too.
Check the study.
Nate, hey, are you here? My agent has me locked in the study.
Please tell me the party's good.
I decided not to come.
What? Why? Is everything okay? No, dude.
It's not.
What? I thought you - Derek? Really? I mean, I can't believe I'm not even important enough to merit my own character.
I'm one of your best friends, Dan.
At least I thought I was.
No, every writer condenses people for better dramatic effect.
Hemingway did it.
Uh, Joseph Mitchell did it.
You have a lot of explaining to do, Humphrey! I am so sorry I wasn't able to stop by.
Nate, I gotta call you back 'cause Blair and Serena are here.
Oh, right, because they're more important, which is why they got their own characters.
No, wait.
Nate is - Furious? Yeah, because I am.
And I'm more furious, if that's even possible.
I could lose my job over this.
I could lose my fiance! Wait.
What? I didn't read your parts.
He wrote that we had s*x! You slept with Dan? - No, you really think I would do that? - It's not what you think.
Is this true? - Of course it's true.
This is why you had me kill your story and why you asked me not to read it.
I came here because I thought my suspicions ridiculous.
Turns out the only thing ridiculous is me.
I should have known.
Dan, your father and stepmother - Oh, great.
You're all here.
Hi! - Perfect opportunity for - A photo! Everyone in? Looks like the best piece of fiction is that people people are actually happy for Dan Humphrey.
Is this what you've been trying to tell me all day? No, because it never happened.
It never happened.
I don't believe a word you say.
You said yourself that Dan has no imagination.
Okay, uh, thanks, but, Louis, it didn't happen.
I would never lie to you.
You know that.
I never know with you And that's the problem.
We're gonna go check on the guests.
Come on, Rufus.
I have no reason to stay here any longer.
You had better hope I can stop your fantasy life from destroying my real one.
Blair, I never wanted us to come between you two.
When are you gonna get it through your head? There's no "us.
" There never was! There's nothing here but friendship, and even that's gone now.
Please tell me it is time for my entrance.
Not yet, but you'll be fine here with your friend.
Susan Baines was arrested today at her east Hampton estate for an alleged Ponzi scheme reminiscent of the Madoff case.
Apparently, Ms.
Baines' hedge fund, which has been funneling How did you know? Just a hunch.
But then I did my research.
Quite a web you've spun.
But what I can't quite figure out is why.
Maybe the people you've been lying to could explain it to me.
I didn't ask for any of it.
Serena's aunt, Carol Rhodes, paid me to impersonate her daughter Charlie so she could access her trust fund.
It worked.
And I took the money and went back to my real life, only Serena found me and dragged me back here.
Now I'm trapped.
Ohh.
So now you can't get out.
Or maybe you don't want to.
That dress suits you, as does living in a penthouse, I'm sure.
I'm not in it for the money.
Maybe I was before, but now for the first time in my life, I feel like I actually belong somewhere.
But you don't.
And when these people realize you're not one of them, they're gonna destroy you.
Please don't tell them.
I won't.
I'm gonna protect you, if you let me.
What do you want? You're making a big mistake.
In thinking that Blair could be trusted, yes.
She will always have her secrets.
She can't exist without them.
You were right, after all.
You should never listen to me.
If you read Dan's book, you know how I turn out.
You have a chance at having love in your life, not ending up alone hanging in a closet.
Don't give up on your own fact over someone else's fiction.
I'm sorry you're hurt.
No, not hurt.
Mystified.
In high school, you were the only one who saw me for who I really was or who I wanted to be.
You helped me be somebody that I was more proud of.
I didn't know.
Do you even remember the girl that you fell in love with? Or just that she got so drunk on Thanksgiving that she got grazed by a taxi or that she got married in Barcelona or slept with not one but two of her professors? I hate to break it to you, but those things happened.
It's not the things.
It's how you wrote about them.
That's the point.
Dylan Hunter is a judgmental dick who can't even look at himself in the mirror.
My character comes off the worst of all of them.
He puts off his writing.
He misses job interviews.
He ignores his grades.
Why? Because he cares more for a pretty blonde than he does his own future, and in the end, none of his friends are happy for his success.
They all turn their backs on him, and he deserves it! Yeah.
He does.
I need to find Blair.
I gotta make sure she's okay.
No, we're not done here.
I just messed up her engagement.
I could ruin her life.
Yeah, and what about mine? If you can't tell the difference between what I did to Blair and what I did to you, then maybe your portrayal in the book is more accurate than you thought.
That sounds exactly like something Dylan Hunter would say.
It's time.
You ready for your big moment? Absolutely.
Everyone? Everyone.
Hi.
I know you're not all here to hear me speak but to finally find out who is "Anonymous.
" It is with great pleasure that I introduce you to the amazingly special and very talented author of "Inside" Dan Humphrey.
Seems Dan Humphrey's on the fast track from lonely boy to only boy.
Louis didn't return my calls all night.
I don't know if he'll ever speak to me again.
Is that what you were trying to tell me yesterday? Have you two been having trouble? No.
Quite the contrary, in fact.
I wish I was telling you this at a better time, but I'm pregnant.
What? Oh, my gosh! Blair, that's amazing! Wait.
That's that's good news, right? Well, I was happy.
So happy.
But now what if I'm in this alone? No, you're not alone.
Never.
I know I may have been busy since I got back, but that doesn't mean I'm not here for you.
I can always count on you.
I just wish Louis felt the same about me.
I do.
I'm gonna get ready for work.
I love you.
Let me know if you need me.
Louis - Don't.
I'm ashamed enough at my behavior.
I know you have a complicated past, but you've been honest about it.
It's hard for me.
I want to believe, but every time I turn, there seems to be another secret.
That night at constance, you gave me a choice.
And now I'm giving you one.
Either you find a way to trust me, or you let me go.
I could never let you go.
Thanks for seeing me.
Of course, Charles.
I'm so happy you called.
It's been a long time.
Rufus isn't here if you need to talk.
Seems like I'm always off on my own.
I thought you liked it that way.
I don't want to be the unrepentant bad boy who no one cares lives or dies.
It's just a book, Charles.
What if it isn't? There are people that care so deeply for you if you would just let them.
Blair is lost to me.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Hey, how was the party? Oh, I didn't go.
Dan Humphrey wasn't exactly the friend I thought he was.
Mm.
I'm sorry to hear it.
I know how important loyalty is to you.
But I think I have something that might cheer you up.
I wanna introduce you to your new colleague.
Hi.
Hey.
What are you doing here? I needed a new job, so thank you for introducing me to Diana.
Why do I get the feeling that there's more to this story? Oh, a lady never tells.
It's always better to stay mysterious.
Ah.
Why don't you show her around? Sure.
Yeah.
Welcome aboard.
Thank you.
Come on in.
Hey, dad.
Your reviews? I guess you have a lot of reading to do today.
I don't want you to get too excited, but "The New York Post" called your son the "potential voice of his generation.
" And "The New York Times" called the book where is it Uh, yeah, "a searing portrayal of Manhattan's elite with just the right portion of pathos.
" I had to double-check it to make sure they didn't say "pathetic," which is what all my friends think I am.
Is everything okay? Well, last night was your big night.
I didn't want to ruin it for you, but - Well, it kinda went there on its own.
What--what's going on? Did you not like the book? Of course I did.
You're a beautiful writer.
Just Broke broke my heart.
Wait.
Dad I gave up my career to raise you, and I never regretted it, not once Until yesterday when I read what you really think about me.
Has-been turned trophy husband who married for money.
No, that is not That's not what I think of you.
You more than anybody should understand artistic license.
I never expected to be your hero, but I just didn't think I'd end up the fool.
In literature, there are thousands of endings Some happy, some sad.
Some end with a twist.
I want this book.
Well here it is.
I want the movie rights to this book, and since you're good friends with the author, that shouldn't be a problem, right? We're not exactly on good terms right now.
Look, your reputation reflects directly on me, and frankly, this book leaves yours in tatters.
So prove to me I made the right choice hiring you.
I want this book, and you're going to get it for me.
So whatever you did to Dan Humphrey, undo it, okay? You have a week.
Yeah, but I don't know why it says contact here Some stories open the door for something more.
And then there are fairy tale endings where the girl gets her prince.
And endings that turn you introspective about your own life and your place in the world.
Hello? How's my star? Have you been reading the reviews? Yeah, a few.
Well, I have great news.
The book is now number 4 on Amazon, and your reading today at the Union Square Barnes and Noble is filling up fast.
Great.
That's great.
And then there's the ending that you saw coming a mile away and yet somehow still takes you by surprise.
So I'll see you there at 6:00.
And I know.
I don't have to tell you to be on time 'cause you'll be early.
Oh, how many tickets do you want me to put on hold for your friends and family? None.
It will just be me.
But don't worry, my Upper East Side friends.
This story isn't ending.
We're just at the start of a brand-new chapter.

Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I'm looking for an Ivy Dickens.
This is she? I figured as much.
Serena's aunt Carol Rhodes paid me to impersonate her daughter Charlie.
When these people realize you're not one of them, they're gonna destroy you.
What do you want? I wanna introduce you to your new colleague.
Hi.
If they're really your friends, they'll be happy to see your star rise when everybody learns that "Anonymous" is actually Daniel Humphrey.
And it is based on you, sort of, all of you.
Can you believe what he wrote about me? I can tell you from experience everyone loves a villain.
I gave up my career to raise you and I never regretted it until I read what you really think about me.
Personally, I thought you'd be more annoyed at being conflated with Eric.
Nate is Furious? Yeah, because I am.
And I'm more furious! He wrote that we had s*x! I want this book, and you're going to get it for me.
So whatever you did to Dan Humphrey, undo it.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.
O.

Gossip Girl.
On the Upper East Side, it's not what you say that determines who you are.
It's what you do I hope they take it well.
Nothing matters more than our child being born into a big, happy family.
Are you ready? Whether you're making a big announcement Or trying to close a deal Hey, Jane.
Did you lock up the film option for Dan's book yet? No, I just finished reading it, unfortunately.
Need I remind you, this is your chance to make up for blowing the Daniel Day-Lewis deal? No reminder necessary.
I'm on it.
Or firing the first shot.
The site goes live in 20! Oh, Princess Sophie! Beatrice, welcome.
It's so lovely to see you both again.
We couldn't be happier.
Cyrus, you are still a hugger, I hope? Is a northern spotted owl still a predator? Okay.
Okay.
Uh, Blair and Louis will be coming down for their big announcement any moment.
This is so mysterious and exciting.
Well, whatever it is, I'm just so thrilled that it's happening on Yom Kippur, and I hope the two of you will stay to break the fast with us.
As I recall, you're quite fond of smoked salmon.
I am, and we would love to.
So? Alors, la nouvelle ? We're gonna have a baby.
A baby? You're still in college! - Mother.
How wonderful! - Wonderful? It's wh a wonderful surprise.
Uh.
What is the record for the youngest grandmother on the Upper East Side? Cyrus, I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it to sundown without eating.
I am thrilled without reservation As long as the baby is born after you are married, of course.
The last thing this family needs is another b*st*rd.
Oh! Oh, my.
Ah! Thank you for keeping my secret.
What are sisters for? Mm.
Oh, Serena, can you stay for the celebration? The bun in the oven is a big hit.
I would love to, but I have to get to work.
Looks like you have plenty of people to celebrate with, and you can tell me about it after.
Or I'll just read about it.
Oh! Don't you look great? Are you excited about your first day of work? I am.
Wasn't exactly the job I was looking for, but when it fell into my lap, I couldn't say no.
I really don't wanna disappointment my boss.
Well, I'm sure you won't.
I'll make dinner tonight, and we can hear all about your first day.
You don't want to go to the breakfast at the Waldorfs? Mm, not really in the mood.
Oh, isn't that ironic? The state lifts my house arrest, and you lock yourself up.
Well, wish me luck.
See you tonight.
Is that Dan again? You know, the only way you're gonna get out of this funk is to sit down and listen to what he has to say.
I'm not ready yet.
I have to say, when you asked me where you could buy vintage magazines, this isn't what I thought you were talking about.
J.
F.
K.
Jr.
took a lot of crap by not passing the bar, but he redeemed himself by becoming an editor.
I'm just trying to figure out how he did it.
Hey, hey, hey! Victor said you were here.
I brought something for you and monkey.
Well, I better go before I'm late for work.
Nate, don't you think it's time to let it go so we can just be friends again? Only a whole person could answer that question now, couldn't they? I'm sorry I made you half a character in my novel, but you've forgiven people for much worse.
Well, all right, have a good day, Chuck.
Thanks.
I can think of a few girls who'd look good in this.
Humphrey, I'm feeling like my old self again.
Me, too, although not in a good way.
I really thought the days of everyone turning their backs on me were over.
Well, at least this time it's because they hate you and not because they don't know you exist.
Be patient.
Soon, your literary misdeeds will be forgotten.
Along with all your other powers, you can add psychic to the list.
If Serena can forget, then maybe my dad will take my call.
I'll see you later.
Hey.
Hey.
Come on, get out of there.
Get go on.
Can't we let them finish? I'm quite sure it'll be his loss, but, uh, I have patients to see, so You're a doctor? Uh, psychologist, yes.
This is kismet.
I've been feeling, shall we say, out of sorts, recently.
Oh.
Um Here.
"Dr.
Eliza Barnes.
" Chuck Bass.
Nice to meet you, Mr.
Bass.
Come on.
Come on.
Everyone knows the drill.
As soon as we go live, expect the phones to blow up.
It's time.
It's exciting, isn't it? It is.
Imitation might be the sincerest form of flattery.
But stealing is an outright crime, and that's what a new rival has committed when cell phones disappeared and reappeared at the Jenny Packham Show.
Listen, if we launch now, everyone will know she was talking about you.
Not necessarily.
No, it's too big of a risk.
Abort.
For the moment.
And mother will alter the dress to hide the baby bump.
Of course I will, dear.
And Louis and I will fly back to be close to Dr.
Crane for the third trimester.
A honeymoon can wait.
Bravo.
You've got it all figured out.
Mother, I think we have a problem.
A baby is never a problem, ma fille.
I hope you won't try to stir up trouble and ruin this most happy time.
I'm just trying to protect our family's history.
Blair's very controlling.
She's the one making the decisions for the wedding.
She'll do the same with the child.
Louis knows how important a grandchild is to me, to Monaco.
He will protect the Royal tradition.
Yes, but will she? I'm really glad you came.
I'm glad you called.
Enjoy.
Thank you.
You know, I think I owe you an apology.
I may have overreacted about how you portrayed me in your book.
Thank you so much.
I have to admit, it's been kind of hard.
Like, my dad and Nate and Blair still won't talk to me.
Well, things are looking up then.
One down, three to go? Mm.
Never thought you'd be the first.
I am full of surprises.
You know that.
So how has it been everything else, aside from the personal reaction? Yeah, it's been an incredible whirlwind.
I just wish I could be sharing it with friends and family.
Mm.
And, uh, what's happening with the film rights to the book? I don't know.
I hadn't actually thought about that.
That would be crazy.
A movie.
Well If you ever decide you wanna turn it into one, my boss Jane would kill to produce it.
She read the book and loved it.
And she's an amazing producer, too.
Yeah.
Wow.
I mean, thank you.
That would be, uh I mean, that would be great if that could happen.
Yeah.
Uh, what do you know? It's my agent calling.
I have a NY1 interview I can't be late for, but I'm I'm really glad we're okay.
Can I call you later? Yeah.
Hey, Alessandra.
Just confirming the NY1 interview.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Listen, I just had breakfast with my friend Serena, who asked about the movie rights, and I'd love to give them to her.
How do we go about doing that? Unh-unh.
You are not locking down film rights with somebody just because they're your friend.
Her boss is, uh, is a big producer, though.
Uh, Rivington Street Films? She did David O.
Russell's next film.
And while that's great, a ton of quality people want the rights to "Inside," Dan.
You had breakfast with someone's assistant.
I have Harvey Weinstein on the other line.
Harvey Weinstein? That's Huge.
I know.
See you soon.
Hey, Jane, I swallowed my pride and outrage and did what you asked.
We should have Dan's book later today.
And you had me believe "crazy" was just an act? I think you might be suicidal.
What are you talking about? You start work here under, shall we say, duress.
And within five minutes, there's a catastrophic leak to my competitor.
Diana, I swear it wasn't me.
Since you lie like most people breathe, your oath means very little.
Now don't forget, the biggest story I have is you.
If you don't bring me something better, I'm gonna tell the world that you're some failed wannabe actress called Ivy.
I'll get you something.
You just have to give me some time.
Yom Kippur at the Waldorfs' will truly be a "high" holy day, now that Her Royal Highness Princess Sophie has jetted in from Monaco for a bagel and a schmear.
If I were you, I'd have left by now.
What's wrong with her? It seems I now need some launch-worthy stories, and she's the only Upper East Sider I have prepared to cross the lines for her career.
Look, I care about my career.
I'll make a name for myself my own way.
If you want to remake yourself, you have to do whatever it takes.
Give me something, anything On Blair Waldorf, perhaps? But she's celebrating Yom Kippur with her and Louis' families, okay? I doubt it makes for riveting journalism.
Hmm People unable to eat for 24 hours, cooped up in an apartment? Secrets are bound to come out.
Call and get me an introduction.
Are you even Jewish? I am today.
This interview is key because it's your first visual appearance in the media.
You wanna make a strong impression.
Yeah, am I am I dressed okay? I mean, I wanna seem respectful but at the same time, act like this isn't a huge deal.
Not that it is a huge deal, 'cause, I mean, if it was God, I-I would be, uh, I would be super nervous, and I'm totally not.
Oh, they have grapes.
Dan are you with me? Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm with you.
These days, a book needs as much press as it can get, no matter how many glowing reviews there are.
Public television is the last bastion of the intellectual.
If this goes well, Charlie rose could be next.
Oh, that's a good tactic piling on the pressure right before your already-prone- to-nervous-rambling client goes on live television for the first time.
This is the perfect platform to position your book as next year's best picture.
Mention Harvey's interest.
People in Hollywood are sheep.
If someone they respect wants the book, they all will.
I feel like I should call Serena.
I don't want her to think I was stringing her along at breakfast.
Serena knows how the business works, and it's not like you signed a contract.
And if she's really your friend, she'll be happy for you, no matter who gets the rights.
We're ready.
And let's go sell some books.
Blair, have you thought about the hospital you plan to deliver the baby in? Lenox Hill, where I was born, as was my mother.
And for school? Well, I've already sent a copy of the sonogram along with an application to Constance/St.
Jude's.
Blair received an exemplary education.
While a New York education may be adequate for a non-royal, Grimaldis always attend boarding school in Switzerland.
Furthermore, the child must be born in our wing at the Princess Grace Hospital Center in Monaco.
You can't seriously expect to dictate every detail of my grandchild's life.
But this baby is not just your grandchild.
Blair's life and her family are here in New York.
And Louis' are in Monaco.
Uh, now, ladies.
Maman, Eleanor, enough.
Blair and I will discuss these issues privately.
Blair, w-what is it? Are you all right? You'll all have to excuse me.
Mr.
Bass.
I was just on my way out.
Oh.
That's too bad.
You look like you need to talk.
I do.
Yeah, I'll make time.
Thank you.
Would you like me seated or prone? It's your choice.
So Mr.
Bass, why are you here? Well, let's see.
I recently emerged from a period of prolonged numbness.
Starting to feel again physically and emotionally has made me realize I need to try new things to prevent a relapse.
New things? - Mm.
Give me an example.
I've had s*x on Almost every conceivable surface, but never a therapist's couch.
So there is that.
I should've guessed you weren't serious.
I'm sure if you got to know me a little better, you'd see just how serious I am.
It's obvious that you're deeply troubled, and I would be more than happy to help if you were truly interested in therapy.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have Yom Kippur services.
Oh.
You're Jewish? Not that that's any of your business, but I converted.
Well, that's probably a smart move in your line of work.
Good-bye.
Hey.
Hey.
Everything okay? I'm just worried about Rufus.
He and Dan are so close.
I just have to figure out a way to get then to connect again.
You're home early.
We had a rough morning.
My boss is after me to contribute in a big way.
Got any leads for me? Well, with my arrest and Rufus' depression, we haven't been out enough to know anything.
But you're a very smart girl, and I have faith in you.
Guess I won't be needing this hardware if we're not going to the Waldorfs.
What are those? Oh, it's an unfortunate story.
My late husband Bart had his investigator research our whole family.
It was awful.
I meant to transfer them into the safety deposit box, but since Serena and Charles broke into it last year I think it's safer here.
Good luck.
Uh, "Sabrina," Dan Humphrey's interview on NY1 started.
He's talking all about the movie.
Read by anyone but me.
And now I understand "Inside" has caught Hollywood's attention.
Well, there's interest from major producers, like, uh, like, uh, Scott Rudin and Harvey Weinstein and, um, Brian Grazer, but we haven't made any decisions yet.
Is there a director out there who you Hey, S.
? I'm sorry to bother you, but I needed a walk, and I realized I should just come to you.
No, I'm glad you did.
I told Jane that I had the option on Dan's book, and now it's like we're not even on his radar.
Can I just Uh, look, if I don't get the rights to this, I don't know what will happen.
I really wanna hear about your working girl woes, but I feel like I'm starring in "Rosemary's Baby.
" Sophie wants to regulate everything about my child's existence.
She's insisting that I move to Monaco and leave my whole life here behind.
That sounds horrible.
But can you convince Dan to put his movie with our company? W are you kidding? His book is ridiculous and so is he, and I really need your help right now.
Why are you gossiping when a deal you're running point on is falling apart on live television? I'm sorry.
This is Blair, my best friend.
I thought maybe she could help.
This isn't high school.
This is my business.
I told you not to embarrass me.
I have an idea for you.
Quit.
Your boss is a bitch.
Let's go get lunch.
My job is important to me, B.
You have six months to deal with your problem.
I have six minutes to deal with mine.
Good-bye.
Yes.
If everyone else is moving on with their lives, then I'm ready to do the same, all the way to Monaco.
You're my family now, Louis, and I want to be yours.
Tell your mother that I'm going to be a Grimaldi, and I intend to live like one.
Well, look who's all grown up.
Doesn't feel that way.
What are you doing here? I need your help.
I mean trying to bed an older woman, and she's being resistant, and it's driving me crazy, which is ironic, because she's a shrink.
You speak old lady.
What's my play? Mm, doesn't work like that.
Same rules apply regardless of age.
You just have to show that you're interested in what matters to the woman more than you're interested im the woman's - Matters.
Exactly.
Look, I wish I could be more help to you, man, but I But what? I thought you had the M.
I.
L.
F.
rules hardwired.
In the bedroom, yeah.
So what else are we talking about? We're talking about Serena's Cousin Charlie.
She'll do whatever it takes to succeed at this job, and I just I won't do it.
Diana's not happy with me.
If only you could be me for a day and I could be you, - we'd both get what we want.
Yeah.
But since we're not in a Jason Bateman movie, we have to think of another plan.
If Charlie's crossing lines, tag along for a while.
See what it takes.
Even j.
F.
K.
Jr.
had to walk in a few sets of footprints before he found his own path.
What are you gonna do? Take an interest in what matters to Dr.
Barnes.
Shalom.
Where is everybody? Oh, my mother and Beatrice are in the kitchen, and your mother and Cyrus went to Temple.
Did you tell them about my decision? No.
I felt that we should talk first.
Is moving to Monaco really what you want? I hope you're not simply bowing to pressure.
Reserve the Grimaldi birthing suite.
We're officially a Monegasque family.
I knew you would both make the right decision.
Thank you.
I love green shrimp.
This is just the fifth night out of seven that we've ordered Chinese.
Keep looking.
I'm sure we'll find something we've never tried.
Okay.
Let's see.
What about the Jade Har Gow? Yeah, the glazed prawns would be wonderful.
Let's try the squid ink rice noodles.
You're just saying that.
Hey, guys.
A bit of unsolicited advice? If you were to go to the Waldorfs', you could avoid having another Chinese dinner.
And maybe if you were to see a family in good working condition, it would remind you how important it is to fix yours.
An evening of friends and Kugel is just what we need.
Ah, comfort food does sound good.
My God, you'd think the Jews had suffered enough.
I don't know how Cyrus can stand all this fasting.
I'm Eleanor Waldorf.
Uh, who are you? This is Diana Payne.
Uh, Nate Archibald called ahead for me? Oh, yes.
Yeah, you're his boss, the, uh, the journalist.
I have to warn you not to try and wrangle an interview with my daughter and the Prince.
It's not a good time.
Actually, now might be your only chance, Diana.
Blair didn't tell you she decided to move to Monaco? What? Yes, how you do feel about your daughter committing to a life away from home? Please.
Blair will do whatever she wants.
Waldorf women are not afraid to break the rules.
And besides, who is she hurting if she does? It's not like she's signing a legally binding contract.
Dan's agent and Harvey are close to a deal.
We're going to lose the project.
I can't believe this.
Really? I can.
Maybe your good friend F.
Scott Fitzjackass had you nailed in the book.
If something doesn't fall right into your lap, Serena, you don't have a clue how to work for it.
Sometimes all it takes to cross a line is a little push.
Harvey read the book himself.
Apparently, he has all sorts of ideas and wants to fast-track it for next year.
What? That's that's Incredible, I know, to say the least.
When Harvey gets involved, Oscars are on the horizon.
That's his office.
One second.
This is Alessandra.
He's canceling? Why? What happened? Apparently, it's on "deadline" that you gave the option to Jane Bettinger? What? Why do I get the feeling you don't really want your brother and Blair in Monaco? My brother's always been the favorite, but he never cared about his title or our family the way I do.
I had hoped his marriage to Blair would mean permanent exile to New York.
Sibling rivalry, backstabbing, familial manipulation.
You really are a Royal family, aren't you? Perhaps I can help you get what you want In return the inside story of a Royal feud.
Since I'm feeling a little raw on the family front, if Eleanor refers to you as "Lily Bass" again, I can't promise I won't return fire.
Oh, I dragged you here.
You have my full blessing to go Sean Penn if need be.
Thank you.
Well, what's going on in here? Cyrus, isn't it time for you to blow the Shofar? It appears that, uh, Sophie had legal documents drawn up regarding the upbringing of our future grandchild.
Blair's supposed to sign these before Sophie returns to Monaco tomorrow.
Is that absolutely necessary? Oh, well, let's not quibble over a signature.
I'm a 21st century girl with 2 lawyers for dads.
I understand the need for paperwork.
Some of these requirements are pretty egregious.
Any time you take your child out of Monaco for more than six hours, you have to inform Palace security.
Now that's a little over-the-top.
Not for a Royal heir.
Give me your pen.
Blair, it says here that you can't go to New York for more than 48 hours at a time.
And furthermore, if you break any of these rules, you face the possibility of losing custody of your child to the Royal Family.
What? Wait.
No, that's Outrageous.
What going on in here? I'm not off my meds, but I've kind of lost my mind.
Safecracking? Seriously? I'm desperate.
If we don't get something to Diana, we're gonna lose our jobs.
There's a story in that safe.
I saw it myself.
Oh, God.
I hope the Kennedys are rolling over in their graves right now.
I may have a way to open it.
It used to be Chuck's father's.
Just just give me a second.
Thank you, Rabbi.
Thank you.
I'll see you next time? Arthur, let's go around the block.
Dan Humphrey.
Hi.
I recognize you from TV.
Jane Bettinger.
It's nice to meet you.
Yeah, I'm looking for Serena.
Who probably summoned you for me.
I'm a huge fan of your book.
It will make such a great movie.
"Gatsby" for the social media age.
So she's not around? She stepped out.
Maybe I can help.
Can you explain to me why she told Nikki Finke that you had the option? I'm sorry? What are you talking about? Serena does work for you, doesn't she? False leaks are for amateurs.
Serena said she knew you, she'd get me the book.
I would never have instructed her to go behind your back to do so.
I've known Serena forever.
I have a hard time believing that she would sabotage me unless you made her.
Serena.
Do you have anything to say for yourself? Jane didn't make me do it.
It was my own idea.
Mother's finally gone mad.
She threatened Blair with the loss of her child if she breaks a rule.
It doesn't surprise me at all, Louis.
You know what a tyrant she can be.
Mother, how could you do this? Excuse me.
It's a simple custody agreement.
A "simple custody agreement" does not allow you to take our child from us if you don't like something Blair chooses to do.
What are you talking about? You wrote this, didn't you? Yes, but I didn't put in any such clause.
It was probably a mistake, mistranslated by Dominique as you dictated the terms to her.
It was no mistake, Beatrice.
You must have put it there.
Yes, I did.
Blair has no respect for our traditions or the monarchy.
She'll do whatever she wants with that child.
I can't believe you'd betray us like this.
Obviously, Sophie, you'll remove that clause.
My daughter's actions may have been underhanded and deceitful, but Your reaction makes me think that she might be right.
If you really want to embrace my family, you will have no problem signing this contract.
The clause stays.
If you two cannot accept this, then I will not acknowledge the child as my heir.
Nor will I acknowledge you.
You don't have that right anymore.
As the future reigning Prince, it's up to my child to acknowledge you.
We are done talking, Louis.
I wish you could find it in yourself not to make this terrible mistake.
It is you who is mistaken throwing away your loyal family for a fiance you shouldn't trust.
Do you realize that Blair told Beatrice that she was pregnant long before she told you? Do you really believe she has no other secrets? It's true it's been a bit of a journey.
But I trust Blair.
I know all of her secrets.
My darling.
How innocent you are.
I only wish for your sake that is true.
Good-bye.
I know that you have always felt overlooked, but no more.
All I've ever wanted was your love and respect.
This is the mother lode the biggest secrets of the Upper East Side.
Even one of these would not only launch the web site but blow Diana's mind.
And my ethics.
These are my friends.
Now that I've actually done this, I don't know what I was thinking.
I don't even wanna look at them, much less hand them over, so let's just put them back, pretend this never happened.
If I show up to work empty-handed, I'll lose my job.
I know how important it is for you to succeed.
It is for me, too.
But we'll find something else.
What about all that stuff you said to me about the Kennedys? Isn't that why you texted me, because you know you won't get where you wanna be unless you bend the rules a little? Charlie, these might be my friends, but they're your family, and you're acting like you barely even know them.
Oh, my God.
I You're totally right.
You know, I'm gonna put them back, and you should just go.
I'm I'm really I'm sorry.
No, hey, don't be sorry.
All right, I know what it's like to feel the pressure to make a name for yourself.
But you belong here.
You'll find your place eventually, the right way.
I just donated $100,000 to Chabad to find out which temple you attend.
The least you could do is give me a minute of your time.
You could've had 50, but you wasted them.
Knowing your reputation, I expected nothing less than an entirely inappropriate manipulation.
I don't think it's that simple.
You asked for my professional opinion, and now you're gonna get it.
You never had a childhood, and so you behave like a child in the worst ways.
You pay for intimacy so you're always in control and no one can get close to you.
Your superficial connections and lack of authentic emotion leave you isolated and alone.
Not just tonight.
Always.
I wish you all the best, but you're gonna need more than that to live a happy and normal life.
I followed Jane all the way down to her town car, apologizing, and even then, I don't think it was enough.
Thank you for waiting.
I didn't want to.
You scared away everyone, and now no one wants the book.
Dan.
Your apology this morning was just strategic, wasn't it? Yeah, pretty much.
Look, I finally finished the book and I told you, it it's not you.
Yes, there are are parts of you And Daisy Buchanan and Amy March and Gwyneth Paltrow five different roles she's played.
But it's a novel.
It's inspired by a lot of things.
It isn't speaking to some deeper truth.
Are you sure? Because I know this may sound Crazy or or selfish or like I'm living in the past Or something.
But you were the love of my life, Dan.
And I don't know.
I I guess I just thought I was yours, too.
That's the thing about writing what you know.
Soon everybody else knows it, too.
Let's see Gossip Girl scoop this.
I told you it'd work out.
She found something, and we didn't have to sell out our friends Or ourselves.
Yeah, you're right, and, uh, looks like my job is safe.
Yeah.
At least for the moment.
And thanks again for helping me do nothing.
Well, it was fun breaking into the safe, wasn't it? Okay, everyone, now the real work begins.
Get to your desks and start writing.
I want a constant stream of content 24 hours a day.
Oh, Charlie, come back to my office in five minutes.
Blair, darling, I have to confess that, um, I may have been the one to put the idea of a contract into Beatrice's head.
I was just bragging about you, and it didn't matter where you lived.
No one could keep you from being your own person.
And that is part of why you will be A wonderful mother.
Thank you for saying that.
I know this isn't what you wanted for me.
Hmm.
At least not yet.
These things happen when they happen.
It's the first lesson of being a parent.
Children don't do What you want them to do all the time when you want them to do it.
But you love them Anyway.
I bet you never thought you'd hear such good parenting advice from Eleanor Waldorf.
It's time for me to let my anger go and return Dan's calls.
I mean, if he didn't piss me off, it'd just mean he wasn't growing up.
That is the Rufus Humphrey that I love.
I'm so relieved I don't have to live my entire life on one square mile of jagged coastline.
I belong here with my family, that respects my hopes and dreams.
I hope that includes me.
Can we talk, B? When you told me you were pregnant, I said that I would be there for you, no matter what, and I haven't been.
And I'm sorry.
Well, you had a work crisis.
Yeah, but the truth is that I was jealous.
Well, if it makes you feel better, marrying a prince isn't what fairy tales will lead you to believe.
Well, that's not what I was jealous about.
You're the star of Dan's book.
Well, as I said It's pure fiction.
Oh.
I wanted to return these to you.
And you're not gonna use them ever? Anything of value in these was already on "Gossip Girl," and everything else was far too tame.
Just put them back before anyone notices they're gone.
Oh, Charlie? You forgot one.
Hey.
Hey.
Uh I thought about what you said earlier.
And how can either of us know who the loves of our lives are until we're, uh until we're old, you know? I mean, this this thing's not over yet, right? And, uh I told Alessandra that I'm giving you the book rights.
No, you don't have to do that.
I wasn't trying to guilt you into it.
No, I know, I know, but without you inspiring me from the beginning, I wouldn't have been able to write anything, so I owe you one.
And despite the events of the day, you know, I trust you.
I do have one condition.
I want to write the screenplay.
I'll talk to Jane right away.
All right.
Oh, you know what? That's my dad.
Uh, he's on the other line.
I'll see you soon though.
Yes, in very long development meetings.
Okay.
Hey, dad.
As challenging as atoning can be, the rewards make it worth the sacrifice.
Everything you said to me was true.
I don't need another notch on my belt.
I need help.
I knew it last week.
Hell, I knew it last year.
I know it now.
I'm ready to be serious if you'll have me.
Hello? But the most difficult part can be admitting that there was a sin to begin with.
Most people find it too hard to face their crimes and think it's easier just to pretend nothing ever happened.
What are you doing up here all alone? Waiting for you.
Oh, I was looking for a pen.
I'm sorry you had to choose between me and your mother.
It's the last thing I wanted.
You're my only family now.
I'm gonna go run a bath.
The problem with hiding your sins is they always come back.
And on the day when some have atoned for past transgressions, a once-pure prince can't help but commit a new one.
I have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.
I'd like to meet so I could tell you more in person.
I'm more than willing to pay for your time.
X.
O.
X.
O.
Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here-- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I want the movie rights to this book, and since you're good friends with the author, that shouldn't be a problem.
Uh, we're not exactly on good terms right now.
I told Alessandra that I'm giving you the book rights.
I do have one condition.
I want to write the screenplay.
What are those? My late husband Bart had his investigator research our whole family.
There's a story in that safe.
I saw it myself.
I want to return these to you.
And you're not gonna use them ever? Anything of value in these was already on "Gossip Girl.
" "Dr.
Eliza Barnes.
" You look like you need to talk.
I do.
You never had a childhood, so you behave like a child in the worst ways.
Your superficial connections and lack of authentic emotion leave you isolated and alone.
Throwing away your loyal family for a fiancee you shouldn't trust.
Do you really believe she has no other secrets? I would never lie to you.
You know that.
I never know with you.
I have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.
I'd like to meet so I could tell you more in person.
I'm more than willing to pay for your time.
They say the road of life is long and winding, so it's important to mark the milestones along your way, from picking your bridesmaids So many minions.
How you ever going to decide? Tryouts begin after breakfast.
All right, let's put the bar up front, the D.
J.
in back, and the caterers can sit up in the bullpen and we toss out those moving boxes.
Nate, can I add one more thing to your to-do list? Definitely.
To christening your boss' new desk Oh, my Landing on your first best seller list Number nine.
"Inside" by Daniel Humphrey.
What did, uh, Lincoln Hawk's first single debut at? Eight.
Ah, but don't pay too much attention to that stuff.
That was the '90s.
To finally asking for help.
So how are you feeling today? Fit as a fiddle.
But keep your eyes on the road, Upper East Siders, or you could get lost along the way.
That was a productive morning.
Yeah, I got a lot accomplished in a short amount of time, didn't I? Don't gloat.
If anyone deserves top marks, it's me.
Mm.
Now zip me up.
So I was thinking about the party tonight, and I was thinking that maybe you could be my date.
You're joking.
You're not? I mean, isn't it time we finally told the world we're a couple? I can't think of a better time than tonight.
I can't think of a worse one.
Tonight's the public launch of my new media empire.
I'm showing New York City who I am.
Besides, we both knew that female bosses can't mix business and pleasure without people whispering about them behind their back.
Okay, but I'd still like you to meet a few of my friends.
I mean, can we at least talk about that? Of course.
Right after you and Charlie deliver the new "Spectator" tablets to all our V.
I.
P.
guests.
You ever heard of a messenger service? So some unattractive delivery guy can hand them to an assistant who's just gonna sell them on eBay? I don't think so.
Here is your list.
Charlie? I mean, seriously? This is like four pages long.
Don't pout.
Charlie, you are east side.
Nate, you're west.
And I have to run because I am late for a meeting with an old friend from L.
A.
I knew I shouldn't have worn heels today.
The dream starts the same every time.
They have a habit of doing that.
I'm taking an early morning stroll in my new Berluti wingtips.
I look up, and a block away is the most magnificent skyscraper I've ever seen.
I have to get inside it, but every time I round the corner, it's still a block away.
So what do you do? I start to run, but as soon as I reach it-- You wake up.
What do you think the dream is about? My father's tragic death? My mother's secret life? Or perhaps my chronic oral fixation.
I appreciate your sense of humor, Charles, but-- But you think it's just a defense mechanism against intensive therapy.
Be honest.
You know you're holding back.
How can you be so sure I'm hiding something? Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel there's a piece of the puzzle still missing.
It's not your mother or your father.
There's someone you're not telling me about.
Mmm.
Good morning, Blair.
Mmm.
Don't you just adore us? Why do I feel like there's a request coming? Not a request.
A special dispensation.
For what? Scheming and manipulating.
Who do you work for? Louis, can't you just turn a blind eye for let's say 24 hours? Blair All I'd be doing is spending the day with my former minions.
Maybe some light waterboarding involved.
But I've been so good for so long.
And once I'm Her Serene Highness of Monaco, all meddling will be prohibited.
Queen B.
need last hurrah.
Are you sure that's such a good idea? Forgive me.
I've just never understood this Upper East Side tradition of yours.
I know, and that's why we're perfect together.
You don't have the scheme gene like I do.
You don't get the itch.
Maybe it hormonal.
Darling, it's just one day.
Je reviens tout de suite.
Okay.
I give up.
I'll look away.
But only until the party tonight.
That's more than enough time.
Commenced! Don't worry, my love.
Nobody will get hurt That badly.
Mmm.
Hey, Dan's on his way up.
Serena, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine-- Diana Payne.
Serena.
I think you came to a party at my house in Los Angeles, but I was indisposed.
So good to finally meet you.
So nice to meet you, too.
Serena's my latest find.
A month ago, her job was getting my director three shots over ice.
Now I've got her optioning best sellers for me.
I'm going to go get a tart cherry juice and call David O.
Russell.
I'll be back in time for our meeting.
It's such a small world.
My good friend Nate Archibald actually works for you, and my cousin, Charlie Rhodes.
Oh, yes.
Well, they've both been instrumental in helping me rebrand "The Spectator.
" Oh.
I hope you'll be coming to our launch party tonight.
Oh, no, I wasn't planning on it.
Oh, but you should.
In fact, someone like you with your influence should have her own place to speak her mind.
Have you ever thought about blogging for a web site? I know my readers would love to hear every detail about your life.
Oh, well, there's already somebody who's all over that.
I'm not really a fan of her work.
Gossip Girl doesn't have the monopoly on Serena Van Der Woodsen, does she? No, but I've been hurt enough by what she's said that I could never willingly take part in something like that.
I hope you'll come to the party anyway.
It'd be great to keep talking.
Bye.
As faithful minions through the years, you've each earned a chance to be immortalized as a bridesmaid in my royal wedding, but legally, I must warn you, not everyone will survive the tryouts.
So I've drafted a waiver for you to sign in the event of a catastrophe.
Kati, Penelope, nice to see Constance so ably represented.
Jessica, Columbia's finest.
Blair, it's always been my dream to be your bridesmaid-- Do yourself a favor and stop talking right now.
Even Pippa knew when to pipe down.
Where's Nelly Yuki? Yale, where she got in and you didn't, plus she hates you, remember? Well, an odd number just won't do.
We need another contestant.
Charlie.
You're the maid of honor's cousin.
You should be in the mix, too.
What are you doing right now? Nothing? Then get in line if you dare.
Hello, doctor.
What's this? The rest of what I owe you.
I told you it'd be worth your while.
Now you can settle all of your father's debts.
What do you want me to do? Just make sure my fiancee will never fall for him again.
Louis, that's up to Blair.
No.
It's up to you to turn Chuck back into the monster he was for the first 20 years of his life.
He's a time bomb.
Find his fuse and light it.
Looks like Louis is about to make young Bass' road to recovery a very bumpy ride.
Better buckle up, Chuck.
Dr.
Barnes, what are you doing here? A house call is a little out of the ordinary in my line of work, but I felt our last interaction ended too abruptly.
May--may I sit? Of course.
I was hoping that being in your environment might help.
Well, I applaud your persistence, Dr.
Barnes, but I've searched the far corners of my mind, and I'm not hiding anything, from you or myself.
I'm an open book.
Then let's skip to the chapter about Blair Waldorf.
I live in this city.
I read the papers just like everyone else.
You've done your homework, but I don't see how my history with Blair or the tabloid fodder it produces is really relevant to my therapy.
It's relevant if the Blair is the source of your suffering.
Aren't you upset that the love of your life is marrying someone else? I let Blair go.
Let's leave it at that.
You're actually telling me you're not furious.
Next chapter.
Have you ever thought it's your denial of these feelings that's giving you nightmares? Expressing your rage and anger is part of your healing process.
You can't move on until you let it out.
You have to face that you didn't let Blair go.
You lost her to someone else.
You don't know what I did.
But yes.
Maybe there is something else I need to do if I'm ever going to move on.
I don't want to lie to you.
I don't want to lie to myself.
If I've really let Blair go, I don't need this anymore.
It's beautiful.
I bought it to give to her.
I've been keeping hold of it ever since.
And really what I should do is just return it.
If that's what you need to do, you should do it.
You take it.
Just give it to charity or something.
I don't care.
Just-- just--just take it away.
Thank you.
So, Mr.
Screenwriter, are you ready for your first ever development meeting? I think so, as long as you guys don't want to change the ending or the beginning or all the stuff in the middle.
Don't worry.
You'll love working with Jane.
Ahh! There he is! Oh! Hey.
We're so excited.
Mwah.
Mwah.
Dan, this is Natalie, my exec at Warners.
Hi.
So nice to-- I love, love, love your book-- the characters, the voice, everything.
Honestly, you should just transfer the novel straight to final draft.
Copy, paste, done.
Wow.
Thank you.
Do you don't have any notes before I start writing? Well, we'd love if you could open up the world of Upper East Side a little bit more.
Rich people are so hard to like.
Maybe you can add someone more relatable? I thought I did that already.
I-I think Dan is referring to his main character, Dylan Hunter.
He'll appeal to everyone.
He starts off as an innocent from Brooklyn-- Who quotes Hawthorne and screens Fellini films? I don't think so.
We need a real outsider as a hero.
A tragic backstory would give him more to overcome.
Maybe he's an orphan.
Wait.
Wait-- Now another thought that occurred to me was to "Glee" this up.
You know, music-- originals or covers.
Okay, stop.
What's going on? I thought we were talking about turning this into an important independent film.
Dan, relax, we're just talking.
About turning my book into "Newsies.
" "Inside" is my life.
And thank you so much, but I don't need anyone to tell me how to write it.
A royal wedding is more than just the most glamorous event on the social calendar.
It is also the most dangerous.
People will try to kidnap you and break you for the details.
Paparazzi will tap your phones.
I need to know who of you is going to crack under the pressure.
The contest today will simulate how you perform your bridesmaids duties under extreme duress.
Now fall in line! Dressing me for my wedding day means attending to my every need, no matter how big or small.
Adjust for reception! Cinch that train! Penelope she has to pee! Okay.
Where secret wedding location?! We don't know! Who design Ms.
Blair wedding dress?! We can't tell you that! Good one, Jessica.
Now block that baby bump! Blocking.
What baby bump? Lets go, girls! Faster! Who wants it?! You know the rules! You trip, you're out! You spill, you're out! Whoo! Come on! Nice work, Charlie.
I like what I see.
Yah! Ahh! Ow.
Ha! I'm sorry.
I You sicken me.
May I help you? Yeah.
I work for Diana Payne, and she wanted me to hand-deliver Keith Gessen the new "Spectator" tablet.
It'll serve as his invitation for the party tonight.
Keith doesn't need an invitation, since he'll be attending with Diana.
Oh, but I'll gladly take the tablet myself.
Wait.
So he's going as her date? Hello! They've been going out for two months.
I thought you worked in media.
Hey.
I know this morning was a total disaster, but nobody blames you.
Whatever Jane sent you here to say, why don't you just say it? Well, we both think that you should waive your right to write the script.
Why would I do that? Because if you write it, your project will be stuck in development hell.
You'll write a draft.
A year later, you'll still be rewriting it, and you'll never give them what they want because you're too close to it.
And that's not even the point.
Well, it sounds like it was.
Dan, you're a huge novelist now.
I don't know about huge.
I mean, I'm number nine.
And next week, you'll be number one.
I'll take two.
I'm not greedy.
Seriously, you should be focusing on your next best seller.
Let us hire an "A" list writer like-- like an Akiva Goldsman, somebody who Jane can't bully, somebody who gets great movies made and who will honor your book faithfully.
You really think you could get someone like him to write it? Absolutely.
Jane works with Oscar winners all the time.
But how can I guarantee that she's not just gonna screw it up? Because I won't let her.
She may not know this world, but I do, and I will protect your story and you.
Careful, S.
I have your word? You have my word.
Everybody knows the road to hell is paved with good intentions and shady bosses.
Hello? - Hey.
There you are.
Why aren't you back here yet? I got a little hung up at Keith Gessen's office.
Were you ever even gonna tell me that you're bringing him as your date tonight? Of course.
I wanted to say something this morning, but, um-- But you were too busy lecturing me on how you can't mix business with pleasure, right? Keith's just business, really.
You are both.
But no one can know that I am.
Not right now.
I know you don't understand, but you need to trust me.
No, you know what I need to do? Is rethink this whole relationship.
Get me Charlie Rhodes.
Okay, Dan's off the project.
Take a bow, Serena.
You're a star.
How'd you accomplish it? Well, I just convinced him that--that he and his novel would be better served by a top-tier screenwriter.
And he will be.
Sorkin's agent called right after you left.
Aaron Sorkin? Is adapting "Inside.
" Oh, my G-- What? That's--that's incredible.
How did you get that to happen so fast? I had Sorkin lined up for a week.
His agent and I were just waiting.
For me to convince Dan to quit? So this explains your "Inside: The Musical" pitch.
Come on.
I always knew that Dan was never going to work out.
I just gave him a little nudge.
Be happy.
Sorkin is a good thing.
I just wish we could have spared everyone the drama this morning.
Are you kidding? Dan coming in this morning did more for this project than you'll ever know.
Why? Because we got to see what this movie should really be.
A self-important teenager who betrays his friends for fame and fortune.
"Inside" will be the next "Social Network.
" We're going to Zuckerberg him.
Jane, this-- this isn't fair.
I prefer to let the audience decide what's fair or not.
Dan is not like that.
Why don't I put a dinner on the books for all of us? And this way, you'll see.
The next time I see Dan will be at Cannes when I'm shaking his grateful hand on the dais.
I have a call to make.
See you at the party tonight? Congratulations, girls.
You've survived the most physically and mentally challenging day of your lives, and all you have to show for it are a few bruises.
Now for the final round, you will be accompanying me and my prince to the fabulous "Spectator" launch party tonight.
We're going to play a little game with one of the guests there.
Well, who's the target? A boy, of course.
I'm listening.
At the wedding, you'll be the apple of every bachelor's eye.
So I need to know who is going to bag a baron and who's going to embarrass me.
With a busboy.
Exactly.
So Tonight, whoever's the first to get a kiss from one of New York's most eligible bachelors wins the right to call herself my royal bridesmaid.
So tell us, who is it? Dorota? Will you do the honors? Nate Archibald! I am so all over this.
Yes! Yes.
Oh, my God.
So excited! Hello? Why is Nate calling me from Keith Gessen's office? All I asked you to do was make a few simple deliveries to a few specific people, and you botched it.
I know.
I'm so sorry, but Blair's having a competition to pick her bridesmaids, and if I win, I can cover the royal wedding for "The Spectator.
" Then you'd better win, for your sake.
I just have one more task to complete.
Hey.
Hey.
Uh, are you free tonight? Jane was--was hoping that you would be my guest to "The Spectator" party.
Let me guess.
Jane loves me again now that I quit the movie.
I think she just wants to get to know you better-- the real you.
So be super nice, okay? I'm always nice.
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.
Spotted-- S.
trying to navigate a slippery slope.
But she's not the only accident waiting to happen.
Hey.
Did you get my texts? Oh.
I turned my phone off, actually.
Are you okay? I'm, uh I'm good.
He says, teeth clenched.
Come on.
Let me help.
I'm really good with other people's problems.
Not so much my own, but Well, there's this-- there's this girl.
And I asked her to be my date to the party tonight.
And she said "No.
" Which was fine, until I find out that she's bringing another guy.
Do you think that she's trying to let you down easy? Easy's not her style, no.
Well, then she's trying to make you jealous.
Trust me, Nate.
We're all the same.
Okay, so what do I do? Fight fire with fire.
Take me as your date.
Well, no.
I wouldn't wanna-- I wouldn't wanna ruin your night.
I You won't.
Pick me up at 6:00.
Whew.
You're getting excited, aren't you? You're getting excited.
Come on.
Dr.
Barnes.
You shouldn't be here.
And I wouldn't be, if you answered any of my calls.
I told you, I'm done.
I can't be responsible for destroying a young man who's doing everything he can to heal himself.
And what about our deal? As much as it would have helped, here's your refund.
At the tone, please record your message.
Dr.
Barnes, it's Chuck.
I think I'm in trouble.
Can you meet me tonight? Because when you drive Chuck over the edge, it's you who will wind up roadkill.
So how was your day? Just what I needed.
Old habits die hard.
Hello.
If they die at all.
What are they doing here? I thought we agreed we'd be done by tonight.
And I will be, my dear.
The girls just have one more tiny, little thing to take care of.
You won't even notice they're here.
Where's Nate? Where's Charlie? Game on.
You look amazing.
I wanted to offer my sincerest congratulations.
Chuck Bass.
Diana Payne.
So nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you, and let me just say, the best of it does you no justice.
I'm sorry.
Have we met before? Not that I can recall.
It's funny.
Just looking at you now, I could have sworn-- I think I'd remember.
Enjoy the party.
Chuck.
Your Highness, always a pleasure.
Give it a rest, Bass.
I'm sorry.
My friend is here.
Dan.
Jane, hey.
Thank you so much for inviting me.
I appreciate it.
Of course.
I'm just so happy you can make it.
Serena, look, I found Dan.
Did you already tell him we got Sorkin to write the movie? What? No.
That's incredible.
I know.
Now your character will talk even faster than you do.
You--you mind if I call my agent and tell her? I'll be right back.
Don't think I don't know what you're doing by bringing him here.
You can't guilt-trip me into changing my mind about the lead character.
I just wanted you to get to know the real Dan.
He--he's genuine and caring and funny.
The Zuckerberg version is the better story.
The better movie.
I gave Dan my word that I would protect him.
He's one of my best friends.
Please don't do this to him.
It's already done.
And you know what? I'm taking you off this project, effective immediately.
Like Dan, you're just too close to it.
Nate, these offices are so big.
You have to show me yours.
Oh, I'd love to.
Yeah, we got a lot of, uh-- Ah! There you are.
I was waiting for you at the bar.
Well, you'll have to keep waiting.
Nate just promised me a tour.
Oh! Of the office.
I'll come with.
Yeah.
No, I wanna see your "Spectator," not hers.
Sorry, Charlie.
Ooh, is that a Hellman-Chang table? Oh, my! Aah! Hmph! Serena, you came after all.
I'm delighted.
So what do you think of "The Spectator"? Everyone seems to be having fun.
Except for you.
Well What? I can't help but pry.
Of course you don't have to tell me.
I just got myself into a situation that's gonna hurt somebody I really care about.
I thought I could fix it tonight, but I-- I can't.
Maybe I can.
I'm quite the problem solver.
I don't think you wanna know.
It involves a friend of yours.
Jane? Now you have to tell me.
It's it's about the book option I got for her.
I need to kill the project.
Give me two seconds, and it'll vanish.
Thank you, but--but I'll-- I'll figure it out on my own.
You just said you couldn't.
Jane and I have history.
She doesn't always like to be reminded of it, and it's been a while since I did.
What kind of history? Some things are best left to the imagination.
So How bad do you want your problem to go away? Jane.
Yes? A word.
Oh, just kiss him and win already.
Anybody with eyes can see Nate has a huge crush on you.
I give up.
I would, but I'm starting to feel like I'm not Nate's type.
Hello?! Nate doesn't have a type.
He's like Derek Jeter.
Well, when he saw you, he said that you were the hottest girl at constance.
Nate said that? Oh, my God.
What else did he say? Something about how you were the only girl at constance he wished that he had hooked up with but never did.
Until now.
what you've done with the place, Nathaniel.
Thanks, man.
I appreciate that.
We just, um Let's do this.
Whoa! Oh! Penelope! What did I tell you about consorting with the help? You're dismissed.
What? It's not my fault she tripped.
Hey.
Uh, you leaving already? I'm sorry.
I have to go.
I was hoping we could talk more about the movie.
What movie? It's dead.
If you want to know why, talk to your friend Serena.
I know the night's still young and the bar's still open, but I wanted to take a moment to thank everybody for coming.
It means so much to me to know that if a bomb went off right this second, New York media would be over.
Hey.
Thanks for being my date.
Of course.
I just hope we were able to make whoever you're seeing jealous.
I don't know.
I don't even think she really cared.
Let's make her care.
I'm game if you are.
Yeah? We are going to be different from "Gossip Girl" and other anonymous sites which traffic in damaging rumors and innuendo.
I'm sorry.
Where was I? Um The "Spectator" is only going to print facts.
If you did it, you deserve to get caught, and we're gonna catch you.
So with apologies to my other esteemed editors, starting tonight, I'm gonna be poaching your best reporters and stealing all your best stories.
I have a story for you.
So let's hear it, Mr.
Bass.
My therapist, Dr.
Eliza Barnes, has been using hypnosis to coerce me into performing unspeakable acts.
I am Dr.
Barnes, and I promise you that none of this is true.
It's okay, Chuck.
Y-you're in a very vulnerable psychological state right now.
I wonder why.
Maybe because I just found out you were taking money to reveal confidential information about me.
Now that's a story I can print If you have proof.
Chuck, stop.
Why are you doing this? If you don't believe me, you should ask your fiance.
He's the one who paid her.
Don't worry, B.
You're still marrying a prince of fools.
Blair, wait.
Please, I know how upset you must be.
After all this arguing about my scheming, what you've been doing is even worse.
But I can explain.
What possible explanation could you have for Paying Chuck's therapist to spy on him? I found the paternity test The one that you'd torn to pieces.
Oh, my God.
You didn't tell me you weren't sure who the father was.
No, I I had to get the test.
Yeah, so you could decide who to be with? No.
So we both could have peace of mind, knowing that what I prayed for in my heart was true.
The paternity test showed me that some part of you thought you might still have a choice to make.
And I needed you to see that Chuck will always be the wrong one.
Louis I don't know how many more times I can say this, but Chuck and I can never work.
You know that for certain? I do.
So does he.
And so should you.
Chuck destroys everything and everybody in his life.
And he'll never change.
But what's scaring me is that.
.
You're changing into him.
Did you just kill my movie? Only because I had no other choice.
But I did it for you.
For me? Are you kidding? Listen, please-- Tell me one thing.
Was this your plan from the very beginning? What? Admit it.
You hate your character in the book so much you couldn't stand to see this made into a movie.
Millions of people might judge you, and we all know how much you like that.
Actually, for the record, having the project killed had nothing to do with my image and everything to do with yours.
Jane was gonna do a hatchet job on you, and now I'm gonna get fired for stopping her.
That was fun.
More fun that you expected? A lot more.
I mean, maybe we should just stage another make-out session.
You know, just for us.
Congratulations! Looks like you won Blair's contest.
Wait, what? What is she talking about? Oh.
Didn't you know? This was all a game.
Charlie only kissed you so she could be one of Blair's bridesmaids.
For the "Spectator" of course.
Oh.
Guess she left that part out.
Nate, I'm sorry.
Oh.
Don't fret, Charlie.
I'm sure Nate wasn't completely honest with you either.
Were you, honey? Right then.
I'd better get back to my real date.
Keep up the good work, Charlie.
Cheers.
What, so you used me to get a story? The "girl" you're seeing is our boss?! Well, if it isn't the good doctor.
I thought you should know I'm gonna shut down my practice.
Why? I know people say therapy's a waste of time, but you did wonders with my trust issues.
I understand you're angry.
I don't expect you to ever forgive me.
I just thought you should know S wasn't paying me for information alone.
He wanted me to drive you into a rage, to turn you into this monster you apparently used to be.
Louis is so threatened by you that he wanted to remind Blair-- why she chose him.
Maybe Louis is right.
He doesn't have to be.
You can change.
Do you remember this morning when I asked you about Blair? I was trying to provoke you.
But you chose something else, something better.
You chose to let go.
Continue down that road, and I'll bet you'll find some peace.
I've always wondered what that felt like.
Good luck.
And I'm sorry.
I really did want to help.
Spotted-- Chuck Bass standing at the crossroads.
Looks like we're gonna have to watch his every step.
Serena Word on the street is you're back on the job market.
You don't waste any time, do you? Not when I know what I want.
There must be some way I can convince you to write a blog for "The Spectator.
" Not if it's about the Upper East Side or anyone who lives there, including me.
I'm sorry.
I know that I owe you a favor, but I don't wanna be the next Gossip Girl.
I-I don't believe in attacking people online and spreading rumors.
Neither do I, which is why I wanna take Gossip Girl down.
How? Everyone reads her, and whether they admit it or not, everyone posts.
This city is addicted to her.
Only because she writes about people like you.
Think about it.
If you and your friends are the main reason people care about Gossip Girl, and starting tomorrow, everyone can read about you straight from the source, that would make "Gossip Girl" irrelevant, wouldn't it? I don't know.
Yes, you do.
Serena, this is a chance to have your own voice, to stop the lies and to finally control your own image.
Aren't you tired of swimming in Gossip Girl's fishbowl? Well, I'd have to do it my own way.
I'd expect nothing less.
Come by tomorrow, and we'll brainstorm together.
Okay.
Good night.
Good night.
No more games.
No more secrets.
Either we're in this for the world to see, or we end this right here.
Somebody here to apologize.
Well, I can't say I want to hear it right now, but tell Louis I'll see him upstairs.
Not Louis.
What are you doing here? I-I don't have the energy to rehash tonight's hysterics.
I think you should leave.
I'm not here to apologize about what happened tonight.
Then what are you here to apologize for? Everything else.
I'm sorry for losing my temper the night you told me Louis proposed to you.
I'm sorry for not waiting longer at the Empire State Building.
I'm sorry for treating you like property.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you I loved you when I knew I did.
But most of all, I'm sorry that I gave up on us when you never did.
Thank you.
I hope never giving up on people isn't gonna be my downfall.
That's why you're going to be an amazing mother.
You're always there for the people you love, even when they don't deserve it.
You know that's never gonna change.
It's okay if it has to.
Starting tonight, I'm going to take care of myself.
Is that all? Yeah.
They say every road comes to an end, but sometimes the end feels just like the beginning, even when you think you've come a long way Dad? What, uh, what are you still doing here? Mm.
After I talked to you at the party, Jonathan Karp called.
He got an advance copy of next week's best seller list.
I'm not number one.
Did I go up at all? You dropped off the list.
But when I told him the news about Aaron Sorkin, he said a big movie deal announcement like that will have the books flying off the shelves again.
The movie's dead, dad.
It's over.
I'm--I'm done.
You can suddenly find yourself right back where you started, because every journey is fraught with twists and turns You know, Charlie, you're becoming more trouble than you're worth.
I had no idea you were the one Nate was trying to make jealous.
I just wanted to get the inside scoop on Blair's wedding.
Well Now you know, and so does the rest of the world.
Nate's mine.
Do I make myself clear? Good.
Because I'd hate to have to run a story tomorrow about a poor girl from Florida who Clark Rockefeller'ed the Upper East Side.
And one false step could spell disaster.
But no matter what You still have to stay the course and forge your own path.
No, Louis, I-I know you're sorry.
You should go on your trip.
We can talk when you get back.
Promise.
Besides, a few days apart would be good for us.
Because there's no going back now.
And it looks like this one's going to be the ride of our lives.
X.
O.
X.
O.
Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Jonathan Karp called.
He got advance copy of next week's best seller list.
Did I go up at all? You dropped off the list.
There must be some way I can convince you to write a blog for the "Spectator.
" I wanna take "Gossip Girl" down.
I wish I could explain better, but I can't.
Know that I never meant to hurt you.
Oh, my God.
The "girl" you're seeing is our boss? Now you know and so does the rest of the world.
Nate's mine.
You were taking money to reveal confidential information about me.
If you don't believe me, you should ask your fiance.
He's the one who paid her.
What's scaring me is that you're changing into him.
I'm sorry I lost my temper the night you told me Louis proposed to you.
I'm sorry I treated you like property I'm sorry I didn't tell you I loved you when I knew it.
But most of all, I'm sorry that I gave up on us when you never did.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.
O.

O.
, Gossip Girl.
-DIFUNDE LA PALABRA- Blair? Louis, what took you so long? What are you doing here? Louis' not coming.
Are you thirsty? Shall I serve you up there? No.
I'll come down Just so I can go find Louis.
Let me help.
How do I know I can trust you? You can.
Good morning, Upper East Siders.
Or is it? We hear a certain future royal has had more than one rude awakening this week.
Uh-oh.
Mr.
Chuck in dream again? When Chuck's in them, they're all nightmares.
What he do now? Behave like a perfect gentleman, which makes him even more chilling.
That fake apology of his has permeated my subconscious and haunts me even when I sleep.
Apology not seem so fake to me.
That's because English is your second language.
As the wedding draws closer, he's trying to make me question my decision to choose Louis.
But I have no questions.
And with Louis in Italy overseeing trade negotiations, I'm not going to let anything interrupt my week of relaxation, nesting, and serenity Especially not Chuck Bass' faux-lanthropy.
Or his attention-seeking love of animals.
Grab the bread.
Not even Chuck's media mind games can disrupt the calm I feel while feeding the ducks.
Besides, you could use the exercise.
I'm pregnant, too, remember? * Some boys wanna hold my hand * * some boys wanna be my boyfriend * Please tell me you're not just getting home from yesterday.
Did you spend all night with Zarkana again or what? Early morning charity event meeting.
Is that what you're calling it now charity? Wait.
Seriously? Being decent is more of a struggle than I thought.
If I keep busy doing good, then there's less of a chance I'll find myself in a situation which triggers old habits.
Yeah, well, I have faith in you.
I could use some time on the straight and narrow myself at least away from anyone who might tempt me.
I thought things with you and Diana were going well.
You two were all the talk of the papers last week.
Isn't going public what you wanted? Yeah, except that it hasn't changed a thing.
I mean, we don't leave her house or the office, and it's just s*x and work all the time.
Same as before.
If Diana won't commit to you in private like she does in public, maybe it's time to explore your options.
Monkey! How's the book tour going? Uh, where are you now? Nashua? Uh, I'm in no, I'm in Burlington, Vermont.
You don't sound so sure.
Ah, you know how it is on the road.
All stops start to start to blend together.
It's been great so far, though.
I knew it would be.
People who still go to bookstores are real readers.
They don't care if a book's on some best-whatever list.
Yeah.
It it seems that way.
Uh, turnout's been great.
Charlie, Serena, um, care to join us for a 2011 version of a family breakfast? We don't want to be late.
You know what? I should be going anyway.
I gotta meet Alessandra soon.
That was awkward.
Ugh, long story.
Which I hope I can read about on your new blog.
I know you've been posting, but I haven't been able to check it out yet.
That's the problem.
No one has.
I know Diana wants me to write about myself, but I don't know what to say.
I now realize why Gossip Girl is anonymous and only takes shots at other people.
Maybe it's none of my business, but it seems that if you want people to read you, and you need people to read about you first.
Get Gossip Girl's attention even a date would do it then steal her thunder by telling the real story on your blog.
You know, you may be an evil genius.
When I want to be.
I know you're not happy, but it's what I needed to do to keep him here.
Trust me.
If we're gonna take down "Gossip Girl," it's necessary.
Don't worry.
I won't lose Nate or Serena.
Just give me a bit more time.
I've been thinking about you all week.
Why have you been avoiding me? Look, I have a boyfriend.
Okay? I don't believe you.
Well, you have a girlfriend.
Yeah, who schedules time with me as if it were a board meeting.
And who's my boss.
Well, maybe I want something more.
If you want more, ask for it.
Charlie! My office.
And do us both a favor and ask her, not me.
Well, there must be some mistake.
We just spoke to him from Vermont.
Yeah, of course.
We'll let you know if we hear anything.
What's going on? Is Dan okay? I'm not sure.
That was his agent, Alessandra.
She says he missed his book signing in Boston yesterday, and he didn't check in to Burlington either.
Can't find him anywhere.
Isn't this nice? We're communing with nature, finding our inner peace, and I'll still make my afternoon prenatal massage.
Slow news cycle? Thank you, Arthur.
What are you doing here? Our treaty of 2010 clearly states the duck pond is my domain.
Don't try to fool me with your puppy dog eyes.
I apologize for the intrusion, but your limp-winged friend here waddled into the dog park and was about to become a Labrador's lunch.
And out of the goodness of your heart, you came to his rescue.
I like duck  l'orange as much as the next person, but it seemed cruel to let the poor creature suffer.
Mm, especially in front of a photographer.
What a lucky duck.
I've imposed on your domain long enough already.
If you'll excuse me, Monkey needs his constitutional.
How much more do you need to see? Of duck pond? It not really my thing to begin with.
Of Chuck trying to manipulate me into believing he's become a good person.
He knows perfectly well I chose Louis.
He endorsed my decision.
But now for reason, he's trying to make me second-guess myself.
I can't allow it.
This does not sound like week of serenity to me.
He's forced my hand.
I must expose Chuck as a fraud who's only pretending to evolve so he can win me back before Louis comes home.
In drama, there are many ways to unmask a villain.
I need to start a war between Serena and Gossip Girl.
Stay on her and let me know what happens.
Of course.
Oh.
Regarding Nate, I thought I told you to keep your distance.
You're not gonna want to hear this, but That was all him.
Maybe you should loosen up a little, not be on him all the time? I think I'll pass on the unsolicited romantic advice, thank you.
Just make sure Serena's all over "Gossip Girl".
Diana I would never do anything to jeopardize where I am right now.
I finally have a life here.
I'm not gonna screw that up, especially for a guy.
Sometimes you know who the bad guy is from the start.
* some boys wanna hold my hand * - Oh! - Oh, my gosh! Are you okay? Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I think that was my fault.
No, not true.
I was I was blinded by the maps.
Do you live in this building? No, I work here.
Can I help you find something? I'm looking for my ex-girlfriend, Ivy Dickens.
Do you know her? No, I'm sorry.
I think she But most times, you find out they've been right in front of you all along.
Right.
That's all for now.
Let's reconvene after lunch.
Thanks.
You look like you wanna say something.
Look, I guess I'm just a little confused.
About? Us.
I mean, Diana, what are we? What do you want us to be? I'm not sure anymore, but I'm starting to think we won't be anything if we keep mixing work and pleasure.
Maybe I should start looking for another job.
I get it.
Working together, going home together it's all too much.
Why don't we take a couple of days off? I'm going to Paris tonight anyway.
Maybe you should have some fun while I'm gone, without the pressure of me on top of you all the time? So to speak.
Is that your way of saying that we're not we're not exclusive? If that works for you, it works for me.
I just want you to be happy.
You're my right-hand man.
I can't afford to lose you.
These not look like happy nursery decorations.
I can't rest until I can prove Chuck is still his satanic self.
What do you think would be more effective having his shirts pressed with too much starch or getting him served blended scotch at the Empire bar? What this test testing exactly? We'll be there, in clever disguises, of course, to see him eviscerate the dry cleaner or fire the bartender, thus proving that he's only pretending to be magnanimous when he knows that I'll be there or will see it in the press.
You sure you not just do this because you and prince Louis not in a good place right now? I admit our relationship has seen stronger days.
And, yes, while it's true that I was upset with Louis and his momentary lapse of morality, he only did what he did out of love, and I forgave him.
But I simply cannot have Chuck chucking with my head.
So I have to prove this to him and myself.
So what do you think, starch or scotch? I'm sorry that security guard was no help.
That's okay.
I didn't come to New York to find Ivy anyway.
Really? I had this whole soul mates reuniting story worked up in my head.
Not quite.
Just have some of her stuff to give back to her.
Actually, uh, I'm in town for a job interview I have in two hours.
You know, DB Bistro is looking for a new line cook.
Wow.
Well, you must be a really talented chef to even get an interview there.
It's a huge deal.
If I can find my way there.
Well, why don't I show you? You you don't have to do that.
Well, I've actually been suffering from writer's block lately, so a walk might do just the trick.
You up for some company Max.
Cool.
Serena, by the way.
I just have to take this.
Yeah.
One second.
Hey.
Please tell me the reason you're still not at work is because you met a cute guy in a business suit.
Well, no suit, but definitely cute.
Sounds perfect.
I'm about to walk him to his interview now.
No! Forget that.
You need to take him to lunch someplace fabulous where you can be seen by people that read "Gossip Girl.
" Like, um, that place you took me BG.
I don't know.
I just don't want to make him late, though.
I expect to read all about you.
Bye.
Bye.
Who's the guy? Some nobody she found on the street.
Gossip Girl will love it, trust me.
Now you're off to Bergdorf's to get that picture.
Make your e-mail to Gossip Girl as depressing as you can.
Maybe she'll post it verbatim.
Hey, Charlie.
I can't talk now.
It'll only take a second.
Unless you wanna get me fired, you need to stop talking to me here.
I just wanted to make sure he didn't check out.
Thank you.
Well, the hotel in Boston says he's still checked in.
Well, maybe he just fell asleep.
Remember when you used to tour? We didn't know if we were in Norway or Denmark, never mind what time the show started.
Sure, but we always managed to get make the stage.
And I know Dan.
It's not like him to skip out on an obligation.
And I know you.
What time would you like to leave for Boston? Mm.
The Morris minor is in the parking lot in Brooklyn.
It'd be faster to drive.
Why are you still following me, Nate? You said you didn't wanna talk at the office.
Hey, come on.
You're a Rhodes.
If you had a boyfriend, the whole Upper East Side would know about it.
And what about Diana, who you might not think you're dating but who thinks she's dating you? I'm not so sure that's true anymore.
That's where we're going? So when girls like you say "lunch," they really mean clothes? There's a restaurant inside.
Are you sure we have enough time for this before the interview? I am relying on you to be my official guide to getting around Manhattan.
You know what? I, um I probably did miscalculate time.
You should go.
Go to 6th avenue and make a left.
It's on 44th.
I'm sorry.
Oh, and you should try to work apricots in somehow.
Boulud is obsessed with them.
Wait.
Where are you going? Will you just admit that you're not dating anyone and that you like me? Just a little bit, and we can see what happens? I mean, I'm a pretty good judge on things like this, and, you know, when you kissed me last week, there was a lot of chemistry between us, and I know I mean, that's what I was talking about.
Uh-oh, Charlie.
Looks like you've stayed in character all too well.
Too bad there's always an understudy waiting in the wings for you to slip and fall.
"Nate Archibald's cougar and her cub in pride war.
" Are you purposely trying to make a fool of me? I told you it was an emergency.
To hide from Max, your mysteriously reappeared ex? I do think it seems a tad convenient that the only way to do that was to snog Nate.
Look, I don't know why Max is here, but if he finds me, I could lose everything.
Fine.
I'll take over that side of things and get your ex out of our hair.
You focus on proving to Nate that you do not nor will you ever have any romantic interest in him.
Understood? Thank you.
Just let me know what you want me to do.
Oh, it's very simple.
You're gonna ask Nate out on a date.
They're voting on "Gossip Girl" and in a surprisingly positive turn for the 21st century, the cougar is winning, but it appears you chose the cub.
I didn't choose anything.
Diana tells me she wants to take some time off, then Charlie just kissed me and ran.
I mean, I thought we left stuff like that behind in high school.
Maybe we're maturing too fast.
Which is why you're back to playing "Phantom of the Opera" s*x games? The mask is from a benefit performance of "sleep no more" I'm sponsoring tonight.
The whole audience wears them.
Oh, yeah, I heard about that.
It's kinda like, uh, "Macbeth" in an old hotel, right? And the audience can follow the performers from room to room? And since the set is 100,000 square feet and pretty much in the dark, it provides the perfect opportunity to disappear for a night And avoid any run-ins with Blair, which may set back my recent progress.
Care to join? I can get you a ticket.
Looks like I won't need one.
"Charlie: Scored tix to SNM! Be my date?" Hmm.
Why is it when you don't want Gossip Girl to post about you, she does constantly, and when you do, silence.
I share your frustration.
Ever her "Chuck Bass spotted" page is broken.
Not one blip.
He's off the map.
Wait.
Why are you looking for Chuck? I have no choice.
He's trying to destroy my relationship with Louis because he knows it's vulnerable.
I'm pretty sure the only war Chuck is waging is with his own demons.
He's hired a new therapist.
He's focusing on his businesses.
He's even throwing a benefit tonight for charity.
Oh, no.
He got to you, too? Chuck may be sponsoring a performance, but it's only because in the dark with his mask on, he is safe to reveal his true self.
B.
, whatever you're thinking, stop.
Just work on your relationship with Louis and let Chuck work on himself.
Meanwhile, I'm gonna stay home and work on my blog.
Well, how hard can that be? And if you write about how many strokes it takes to brush your hair, people will read it.
I'll pitch that to Diana now.
You know, Charlie told me that she didn't think anyone would read my blog unless I was on Gossip Girl's radar again.
Well, I always thought you were too good to blog.
Just tell Diana it's not for you.
Well, I think you're too good to scheme.
So if I talk to Diana, you'll leave Chuck alone? Absolutely.
Go talk to Diana.
Good luck.
Hello.
This is Blair Waldorf.
I was hoping you had a ticket left for tonight's performance.
Diana.
Hey.
I am so grateful for all your help last week.
Why do I feel you're about to break up with me? I'm not willing to sell myself or anyone else out to attract an audience.
Everyone sells themselves, Serena.
It's just how you do it that matters.
I don't think you understand.
I've been trying so hard to get off "Gossip Girl.
" Today I almost hurt an innocent stranger to to make you happy.
It just It didn't feel right.
And the worst part is he actually seemed like a good guy, and now I'll probably never see him again.
Oh, my gosh.
Max, we were just talking about you.
Looks like you spoke too soon.
We met this morning.
He, uh, was looking for his ex who apparently works in the building.
Diana.
I'm sorry.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Not at all.
Please stay.
So I just wanted to let you know that I got a second interview with Boulud himself thanks to your apricot tip.
Oh, that's that's great.
That was really nice of you to To track me down just to tell me that.
Well, seeing as you helped your friend Max get a job, you two should celebrate.
Get a bite to eat.
Show him the city.
Isn't your friend throwing a benefit tonight? You know, that That actually could be fun.
What do you think? I'm in.
Great.
Why don't you rush home and get changed, and I'll give Max all the details, and you can meet him there? I can't wait.
Me, too.
Seems "the play's the thing" tonight.
But watch out, players.
You might be the ones getting played.
Welcome all, to the McKittrick hotel.
The card you were handed upon your arrival is your ticket.
If you find yourself holding an ace, please take the door to your left and enjoy.
No talking.
No photos.
No phones.
Feel free to explore, follow, watch, touch.
Curiosity shall be rewarded.
You must remain masked at all times.
Not nice to steal.
Hey, did you see that? Thanks for the invite.
I wasn't sure what to think after you ran off this afternoon.
And, listen, if you're worried about getting in trouble at work, Diana's off to Paris, and we will be wearing masks.
You know, I'm just a little anxious about the performance.
It's dark in there and crowded.
Um I'm gonna get a glass of water before we go in.
Would you just wait for me here? Yeah, sure.
* So I don't die, realize * * who was here before * How's it going? Well, it would be better if you would just tell me your plan.
I don't feel comfortable stringing Nate along.
Well, I had planned just to catch you two together here, making Nate feel so guilty, he came running back to apologize, but something better struck me.
Deuces? All deuces may now enter.
* Sunlight, sunlight * Hey, you ready? I hope so.
* Sunlight * * Sunlight * Diana, thanks again for the tickets.
Is Serena here yet? Oh, you just missed her.
They called her card, and she had to go in.
But she told me to tell you to find her.
She's wearing a beautiful gold dress.
You can't miss her.
Great.
Have fun.
I intend to.
You really think pillows under covers trick me? You lumpier now.
You can't expect me to sit on my pregnant laurels while Chuck gets away with a secret double life.
But you tell Miss Serena that I wouldn't undermine Chuck, but that's completely different than revealing his authentically evil self.
Maybe you need to face fact Mr.
Chuck really is good.
Never.
That's what he wants you to think so he can destroy everything in secret.
Oh! Look! There's famous Polish film director Agnieszka Holland.
Where? Where? Hey.
Hey.
I know you suggested being fashionably late, but maybe I overdid it.
Not to worry.
Max hasn't even arrived yet.
Oh, I hope he didn't get lost again.
Maybe I should go look for him.
Women like us don't do things like that.
Just wait here.
I'm sure he's just running behind.
I'd better get in.
They called queens some time ago.
Can you do me a favor? Nate.
Hi.
Oh, my God.
I'm not even sure how we lost each other, but one minute I'm at this massive feast, the next, I'm in this freaky psych ward.
There was this nurse well, I'm glad you're safe.
Where do you want to head to next? Uh, you know what? Actually, I heard that the experience is even better if you stay split up, so why don't you go find the witches? They're awesome, and I think I see lady Macbeth.
Diana, what are you doing here? I thought you were in Paris.
Well, I decided it was, um, more important to spend time with you.
That's really sweet and unexpected, but I'm here with someone.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, Charlie.
I know.
I saw you both come in.
I have to say, I was surprised.
You said we weren't exclusive.
Neither is she, apparently.
You know she's seeing someone, right? Yeah, she mentioned something about that, but I'm pretty sure she was just making it up.
Well, then maybe they broke up.
Because last I heard, she felt he wasn't paying her enough attention, and she was trying to remedy that.
Anyway I won't bother you anymore.
I just hope you're not part of that plan.
Final group is going inside now.
Don't you wanna join them? Oh, no, thanks.
I'm I'm waiting for someone.
Who it seems isn't coming.
Beguile the time.
Look like the time.
Bear welcome in your eyes, your hands, your tongue * shells of silver * * silver, shells of silver * Blair? Of course you knew it was me.
Was it my perfume? I should get back to the performance.
You can't disrupt the drama.
Looks like we're stuck Together Alone amongst the masked and anonymous.
Do you remember when we used to play dress-up? How could I forget? Though I didn't think this was your kind of entertainment anymore.
At least I know I'm safe, locked in here with the new Chuck Bass who has none of his old urges.
I have to admit, I had a hard time believing you at first, but now I see the therapy, the apology you really have changed.
As warm as it's getting in here, I can sweep the hair from the nape of my neck without setting you off.
It's such a relief To be able to Let my guard down.
Oh, look.
They even have red hots.
Mmm.
You never could resist.
Do you want one? No, but thank you.
No one is looking.
Even the new Chuck Bass must still have some of his darkest desires.
Just a taste.
Mmm.
Are you ready, Charlie? There's Nate.
Go kiss him.
Ivy? Max.
It's been the performance of a lifetime for cousin Charlie, but tonight, it looks like it just might be the final curtain.
I knew you were still the same Chuck.
You thought by one fake apology and a few charitable acts, that you could get me to question all the reasons I'm with Louis, but I was right.
You are incapable of change.
Seems you know me too well.
And now, thanks to you, I'm more certain than ever that I chose the right man.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Blair.
I can't remember the last time I drove it, but it died as soon as I pulled out of the garage.
Yeah, thanks.
Well, just let me know when it's ready, and I'll head back.
Yeah, I need to get on the road tonight.
Bye-bye.
Dan? One more? No, thank you.
Are you okay? I just saw the "Gossip Girl" blast.
"Serena van der Who? Last girl standing, or simply stood up" she is so heartless and humiliating.
Oh, this is nothing compared to when she called me "irrelevant" at graduation or when she lied to the world that I had an S.
T.
D.
This is exactly why we need to work together On your blog.
So Gossip Girl loses her readers, and her attacks lose their power.
Or I just develop a thicker skin, which is what I've done over the years.
It just upsets me when she goes after people that aren't strong enough to defend themselves.
I should probably go.
See you tomorrow.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Well, it turns out you were right about Charlie.
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to see you get hurt, even though I can see how much I've hurt you myself.
How can you hurt me? I'm your right-hand man, after all.
You're more than that.
Last week, I told everyone you were my boyfriend not because you wanted me to, but because I wanted to.
I care about you.
Well, then why didn't you just tell me that earlier? Because I didn't think that was what you wanted to hear.
Although judging from tonight, maybe you'd rather be with someone else.
Think about it.
Let me know.
It was one thing to to feel like my book wasn't exactly appreciated in the Upper East Side.
I expected that.
But but then the readings on the tour I mean, they you know, they were less and less full.
In Hartford, I think, like ten people showed up, and half of them were there to get out of the rain.
My book is a failure, dad.
I'm I'm a failure.
You're not a failure.
When I started touring with Lincoln Hawk, we didn't even have a a bus, a roadie, an amp that didn't create massive feedback.
I know.
I've heard this more than once.
Yeah, but what you don't know about this tour is how many times we played for a handful of people.
In Marfa, Texas, our entire audience was a bartender.
Yeah, but that bartender he spoke to his friends, and they told their friends, and soon we were selling out.
It just takes one person to connect with your art, who feels like you directly communicated with them to start a groundswell.
But you can't connect with that person unless you show up.
Thank you, dad.
I think, uh, I think I needed to hear that.
What are you doing in New York? In town for a job interview.
What's really weird is what you're doing here.
What the hell just happened back there? I recognized you.
Let's get outta here, catch up.
I'm here with someone.
In fact, I thought you were her when you kissed me.
I should really go find her.
Her name's Serena.
Serena van der Woodsen? Do you know her? Everyone in New York knows her of her.
Well, I'd like to get to know her better, so I'm gonna go find her.
Please don't.
Fate brought us back together for a reason.
I miss you.
I made a mistake in L.
A.
, and I'll tell you all about it if you just come with me.
I'm not gonna drop everything because you tell me to, Ivy.
You walked out on me.
You knew it was Max behind that mask, didn't you? I told you we were going to show Nate for the last time that you were the wrong choice for him.
Why would you use Max when you said that you would help me get rid of him? I found a better plan, and I like watching you squirm.
But let me put you out of your misery.
You're fired.
What? Clearly, your ex is going to out your secret.
Please don't do this.
It's already done, and now so are we.
Oh, wait.
One last piece of business.
A quick picture for "Gossip Girl" and then Serena is in place.
Oh, come on Ohh.
Perfection.
What name shall I use when I send it in Ivy or Charlie? Doesn't matter.
I'll surprise you.
All masks eventually have to come off, and with them, so do the gloves.
Dorota, I hope you've learned your lesson.
I will always be right about Charles Bartholomew Bass, and now that I've proven I made the right choice with Louis, tomorrow we can get back to my restful week of prenatal pampering before I welcome my fiance home with open arms.
"Dorota: Thank you.
" So I don't get it.
You kissed Blair so she'd think you hadn't changed? The only way for Blair to move on is if she thinks I never will.
I had to kiss her to set her free.
That may be the most selfless thing you've ever done.
I've never been more good and less happy about it.
And what of your happiness, Archibald? Was there a clear winner in the war for your heart? My heart was always in the same place.
I realized it was my head that was being messed with, so I've decided to make my own decisions instead of letting everyone else pull my strings.
Starting now, I see.
You wanted to see me? Yeah, I did.
Lock your windows, Upper East Siders.
Looks like Serena's cuckoo cousin Charlie is off her meds again and about to jump to her own conclusion.
What are you doing here? What happened to your date? My date stood me up.
What happened to you? I saw "Gossip Girl".
I know I shouldn't let her get to me like this, but I feel like she's after me or on to something.
Maybe I took on too much too fast when I came back.
I told Diana I quit.
I think maybe.
I should just go home.
No, no, don't let Gossip Girl bully you.
Come on.
You have to rise above it.
Everything is so fragile right now.
If I make one false move, my whole world collapses.
Don't leave.
Come on.
Whatever you're feeling, let me help you.
We're family.
I'm so sorry for what I said today.
You don't need to be seen with some guy to define who you are.
Don't worry.
I know that.
I don't think I'll ever see that guy again anyway.
But I'm not alone.
I have you, right? Come here.
I have to go make a quick call, then we'll hang out and chat more, okay? Sure.
* I'll be your thief * * in the night * * so I can steal you * We all wear different masks for different reasons.
Nate, you matter to me A lot.
I was just trying to be cool.
You know, that's my thing, although I'm beginning to see I may need a new thing.
* I'll be your sunlight * From now on, equals.
Just us, together, seeing what happens.
Yeah.
* Oh * * oh, oh * * be my life * * I'll be your calm * You can take it.
Are you sure? Because right now you're my priority, not business.
It's fine.
I'll get the champagne.
* You'll be the air * Hello, Serena.
Everything okay? Not exactly.
You know, it's one thing when Gossip Girl tries to humiliate me, but when she goes after someone like Charlie Ohh.
I hadn't seen "Gossip Girl".
What's she done? Just what she's done a thousand times before, and I'm sick of it.
I'm ready to help you bring her down.
Well, I'm sorry for the circumstances that brought you to this decision.
I'm looking forward to working with you on this.
See you at 9:00.
I'll be there.
Some masks we put on because it's truly who we want to be.
"Dad: Proud of you.
" * tell my world I better try * "Thx.
On the road.
Call u later.
" * by your side * Some we wear because we can't bear to face what's really underneath * Be my life * * when I am dead.
* * I'll be your calm * * in the storm ahead * Or because it's what someone else needs us to be.
* To stay closer by your side * Everything's set.
Good.
Very good.
You should never have doubted me.
You've done a fine job rehabilitating my grandson's image.
He's right where I need him to be.
And Serena's right where we need her, too.
Always a pleasure working with you, William.
And some masks we wear because we hope to stay hidden.
But that's the problem with wearing masks.
They can be ripped off at any moment.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here.
Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
The truth is I was jealous.
You're the star of Dan's book.
Do you live in this building? No, I work here.
Can I help you find something? I'm looking for my ex-girlfriend, Ivy Dickens.
Ivy? Max.
I'm here with someone, and I should really go find her.
Her name's Serena.
Serena Van Der Woodsen? What happened to your date? My date stood me up.
The only way for Blair to move on is if she thinks I never will.
I had to kiss her to set her free.
I just found out you were taking money to reveal information about me.
Chuck destroys everything, and he'll never change.
But what's scaring me is that you're changing into him.
No, Louis, you should go on your trip.
Besides, a few days apart would be good for us.
A shower is supposed to make you feel fresh and clean, but on the Upper East Side, they're where I get the most dirt.
And B.
's bridal shower tonight promises to be an absolutely filthy affair.
The only two people left off the list-- Number one Honestly, a mutt? No wonder Blair chose Louis over you.
Totally right call, B.
T.
-Dubs, 'cause you are so the opposite of royalty.
Still, how royally miffed are you that you weren't even invited to the shower tonight? Girls, I have been trying very hard lately to be good.
Yet I don't feel the slightest pang of guilt unleashing my attack dog right now.
And I should warn you.
He's trained to go after fake Prada.
Good boy, monkey.
"As for number two? In high school, "D.
got left off the list because no one knew who he was.
"Now it's because they know too well.
"Looks like lonely boy needs to change his name to 'Banished boy.
'" Yeah.
Really, guys? Thank you for the support.
Well, listen, I mean, at least they're still talking about you.
If they weren't, I'd start worrying.
Well, that might happen soon, since "Inside" is off the best sellers list.
But the rest of the book tour went better, right? Yeah, it did.
It did much better.
I mean, my hand's still kinda sore from having to sign all those copies.
See? Just give it time.
Things will turn around.
Charlie, how are you feeling? Fine, thanks.
Hi, Dan.
Hey.
What's with her? I should go talk to her.
Oh, uh, Rufus, the table and linen delivery people are gonna be here any second.
I can't believe I agreed to throw a party we aren't even able to attend.
You are such a good mom.
Thank you.
Well, I think I'll pass on watching you guys set up for a party that I'm not invited to.
Who is it? Someone completely undeserving or your love and affection.
I come bearing gifts every perfume Santa Maria Novella has to offer.
Feel free to bash the imperial lavender over my head if you'd like.
That won't be necessary.
I know I did some really stupid things before I left, but I've come back a better man.
I promise you.
I believe you.
And I'm glad because I need you to be your best prince charming at our shower tonight.
What are all these? Hostess presents for Serena.
I had some pieces flown in from her favorite antique store in Paris.
It's the least I could do to say thank you for whatever perfect evening she has planned for us.
They're beautiful.
But how--how do you know it's going to be perfect? Because Serena's my best friend, and she knows what I like better than anybody.
I'm sure it'll be a lovely party.
But? What--what are you saying? Nothing.
It's just, I've done some thinking while I was gone, and I'm starting to wonder if your friends really have your best interests at heart.
Hey, thanks for coming by on a Saturday.
I really appreciate it.
I know I've been critical of some of the choices you've made in the past, but I couldn't be more proud of everything you accomplished here.
Hmm.
Well, I'm working hard.
And I have to say, it feels good to have gotten this far on my own.
Nate, I need you to approve the layout for the new style section.
And who might this be? My grandfather, William Van Der Bilt.
This is my boss, Diana Payne.
Oh, it's a pleasure, Diana.
I'm very impressed by your whole organization.
Congratulations.
I couldn't do it without your grandson.
He's our rising star.
Nate, the graphic department's waiting.
All right.
I'll see your grandfather out.
All right.
Thank God! Why haven't you returned any of my calls? I'm totally freaking out.
What's going on? Uh Diana fired me.
My ex-boyfriend just shows up out of nowhere.
I feel like the truth is gonna come out any second if I don't just leave right-- Listen to me.
You can't go anywhere.
If you disappear, Cece could cut off my trust for good.
Sorry, but that's your problem.
Actually, it's your problem, because if the money stops, then I have nothing to lose, and I'll make sure whatever happens to me happens to you, too.
I didn't get mad when you didn't want to move out of here.
I didn't get upset when you didn't want to convert to catholicism.
That has nothing to do with my friends.
Yes, it does.
It's about the sacrifices you make for your partner.
And what have you sacrificed? You spent your whole trip bonding with your family, who hates me.
They're my family, Blair.
But I've created some much needed distance between me and them, and I think you should do the same with your so-called friends.
This just in.
We hear B.
took a paternity test to find out which daddy makes three.
See? This is exactly the type of thing I'm talking about.
You think someone I know sent that? Your friends know no loyalty.
Each one rats out the next, and you and I get sucked right into it.
My friends and I have grown up.
We're not like that anymore.
Whoever sent that is clearly from your bloodline-- namely your sister Beatrice.
As if she would do that right after we made up.
This was one of your friends, and I'll prove it to you.
Hmm, well, good luck, because I happen to know my friends always have my back.
Serena? I know you're busy with something for tonight, but I really need your help.
Sorry, B.
, can't talk.
Too much work.
Later! I don't appreciate you just turning up unannounced like that.
Would you mind telling me what's going on? I was about to ask you the same thing.
I woke up this morning to find a big picture of you in "The New Yorker," with Nate in the corner as "the man by your side.
" It's supposed to be the other way around, remember? Sorry.
I don't control every publication in New York.
My goal was to remake Nate, not to make you a star.
It's time for you to step aside, give him "The Spectator.
" What? That wasn't part of the deal.
Nate's got talent, but he's still green.
He's just not ready.
Since I am the majority investor in this entire operation, it's within my power to fire you and put him in charge.
All I need is another month to achieve my goal.
That's too long.
You have three days, or you're out of a job.
Humphrey, you lost? What are you doing here? I thought since you're the only other person not invited to Blair's shower, we could hang out today.
What did you have in mind? A trip to the IFC Center to catch a film no one's heard of, then to Shakespeare & Company to see who's not buying your book? No, see, you're the new and improved Chuck Bass.
I thought you could help me overhaul my own image.
You're willing to get a haircut and change your clothes? No.
Then I'm not sure what I can do.
Fine.
Then just make the day go away.
I-I-I will--I will do whatever wildly offensive thing you can think of.
You've persuaded me.
So these two can go over there.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
I'm looking for someone named Ivy.
Yeah, she's probably with the caterers.
Excuse me? Be careful.
That's Lalique.
We got another boxful.
No, sorry.
I think some people here might call her "Charlie.
" But I've always known her as "Ivy Dickens.
" Seems Charlie's in hot water And she's about to get burned.
Um, I'm a little confused here.
Charlie, help me out? Okay.
I never wanted to have to tell you this, but for some time now, I've been pretending to be Ivy Dickens.
Huh? I don't understand.
My mom never wanted me to grow up with the burden of the Rhodes name.
She claimed it ruined her whole life.
People made all kinds of assumptions about her, used her for her money.
She just never wanted that to happen to me.
So she made me change my name.
And you know what? I was happy to, because then I knew people like you, Max, really liked me for me.
You just never know who you can trust or what people's true motives are.
You know? I knew your mother was behind this.
This is just classic Carol.
Last spring, when I said I went to visit my family, I really was.
I just never told you who they were.
We've got a big problem.
I just talked to the board, and they said we're not getting enough eyeballs to the web site.
But our numbers are good.
They're rising every day.
Not fast enough.
They said "Gossip Girl's" still getting more hits.
And unless we can find a way to top her in the next 72 hours, I'm out of a job.
What? Yeah.
Oh, that's--that's-- that's not fair.
I mean, these things take time.
Didn't they see "the new yorker"? They gave me a deadline and a goal, and I haven't met it.
So you have any suggestions for attracting more readers, and fast? Serena's blog's getting some traction.
Maybe we can convince her to write something a bit more personal.
Unless you have pictures of Serena in bed with both "Hunger Games" boys, that's not gonna cut it.
Well, then we gotta go straight to the source-- attack Gossip Girl directly.
Too bad we can't hack into her phone.
Well keep me posted.
Whatever you could do, I'll be forever grateful.
Hey, Eric, it's Nate.
Listen, uh, I have kind of a strange question for you.
I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, you and I have run out of time.
They're coming for you, Neo, and I don't know what they're going to do.
At last.
Oh, this is awesome.
You should try this.
No? Welcome, Neo.
This is all awesome-- not just the bruschetta but the whole thing-- me, you, Keanu.
I never pegged you for a "Matrix" fan.
Something I learned early on-- never watch "A Clockwork Orange" when you're stoned.
Takes your mind to places it has no business going.
Like to Blair's shower tonight.
That is one thing I am not gonna think about-- like, not at all.
Nor should you.
I agree.
I--you know, I could easily spend the rest of my life obsessing over why Serena didn't invite me to the party.
I mean, she--she--she really should have invited me to the party.
It's like she wants me to stay an outsider for the rest of my life.
First she kills my movie, and then she kills my social life.
Have you ever thought it might be your own fault? No.
Humphrey, you wrote an entire novel about being an outsider.
It's how you define yourself.
But if that's not who you wanna be anymore, the only person who can change that is you.
What you need to do is stop with the neurotic navel-gazing And start being like our friend Neo here-- a man of action.
And it just so happens that action and her friend are begging you to take them into Nate's bedroom while I take monkey for a stroll.
Hi.
Serena has been so tight-lipped about the preparations, I haven't a clue what to wear.
Should I be ladylike in De La Renta, avant-garde in Alaia, or magnificent in McQueen? What? You know we can't tell you anything.
We're sworn to secrecy.
What is this, "The Help"? I will not tolerate this insubordination.
Are you her minions or mine? J-just give me a hint as to the size of the gathering and the level of formality, just so I don't show up overly fabulous, if there is such a thing.
Actually, Serena's been so slammed with work and her blog, she hasn't had time to plan anything elaborate.
So it's going to be a rather intimate affair.
Intimate? Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Yes.
Dress casual.
Um, I think the line from the Evite was "Jeans Okay.
" Casual? Jeans.
Evite? She's really playing up this whole "People's Princess" angle.
Oh.
Uh I'm sure she at least got a decent caterer-- Jean-Georges? Michael White? I'd settle for Batali if I had to.
I think she's doing Greek food like gyros.
From some fancy food truck parked next to dozens of other fancier food trucks.
From the cart on 59th and Lex.
Just like the street food you had on your first date with Louis.
It's an homage.
Oh, my God! I know.
But what else could we do? She's your maid of honor.
If you'll excuse me, I've gotta go kill myself Or max out my credit card, whichever comes first.
Hey.
Where's your laptop? Right here.
Why? Okay, I'm about to send you something right now.
Check this out.
Nate, what is this? It's a web page I created with every single e-mail anyone's ever sent to Gossip Girl up until an hour ago.
How did you get this? Jonathan.
Remember when he and Eric hacked into "Gossip Girl"? Well, I asked if he could do it again.
Okay, so what are you gonna do with it? Upload it to "The Spectator" site.
If people know Gossip Girl's not confidential, they'll stop sending her tips, and without informants, she'll die a slow death, leaving "The Spectator" New York's foremost scandal site.
We get new readers, and Diana gets to keep her job.
It's a win-win.
But for Diana.
But think of everyone else you care about.
Literally, everyone we know sent something in, including Oh, my God.
Nate, I just typed my name in, and literally, like, a thousand e-mails popped up.
Serena, you and I both wanna take down Gossip Girl.
This will do it.
You cannot upload this to "The Spectator.
" I'm sorry.
Is, uh, is everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine.
All right.
Who was that? Just Louis.
Look, Nate, you need to put your feelings for Diana aside and think of the ramifications for releasing this.
This would do way more harm than good.
But it's our smoking gun.
That's gonna shoot you, me, and all of our friends in the foot.
Promise me you won't show this to anyone, especially Diana.
Okay, fine, I won't show Diana.
What won't you show me? So This is what my real life is like.
I'm sorry I lied to you, Max.
It's what I wanted to tell you when I bumped into you last week.
Well, at least I finally get it.
All this time I was worried it was something I did that drove you away.
No! You were great.
You've always been great.
Look, Ivy-- I-I'm sorry.
I mean, Charlie.
My feelings haven't changed.
And now that I know why you did what you did, maybe we could give our relationship another chance.
Max, the truth is, after all this lying, I just need some time alone to figure out my real self.
You know what I mean? Not really, no.
I do love you.
And, um I wanna prove it to you.
You have always talked about moving out to Portland to start your own restaurant.
That's your dream.
Now I can help make that happen.
How? Since money isn't really an issue in my family, I could give you something to help you get started.
Would $50,000 be enough? I-Ivy And then in a couple of months, I could come and join you.
You'd really do that for me? I'd do anything for you.
You know, it's getting really late, and I have to get ready for my girlfriend's shower, so let's meet tomorrow before you go, and I can give you the money then.
Okay? Sounds good? Yeah.
It was very nice to meet you, missus Humphrey.
You, too, Max.
Will I be seeing you again? I hope so.
That's a great photo.
Oh, thank you.
Sadly, it's the only real family portrait that I have.
Did you ever meet Charlie's mother Carol in Florida? That's her mom? Yeah.
You know, I-I think I will be seeing you again.
Real soon.
Good.
Uh-oh, Charlie.
Your mother of a lie is about to get you stuck in one big parent trap.
Nate, I can't believe it.
This is exactly what we need.
I know, but we can't release it.
Why? It's the answer to all our problems.
I'm doing it.
Hey, look, I talked it over with Serena, and I just think she's right.
It's too destructive to our friends.
Destructive to your friends or to you? I think you're just trying to save your ass so people don't see all the salacious things you've sent in to "Gossip Girl.
" Okay, honestly, I hadn't even thought of that.
I'm sure.
Why don't we just see how many of your friends you've betrayed over the years? You've never sent anything in to her? Guess not.
Just not who I am.
You really are a good, honest man, aren't you? I didn't think anyone like you exited anymore.
Oh, we're a very rare breed.
That's why when you find one of us, you gotta hold on real tight.
Okay.
You've convinced me.
So you're not gonna release it? Mnh-mnh.
What about you and your job and "The Spectator"? I'll figure something out.
So I've just got a few things to finish up here.
All right.
We need to talk.
Hi, Blair.
You getting excited for tonight? Of course.
We all know how much I love souvlaki.
Who told you? It was supposed to be a secret.
Well, it's not.
Is Serena there? She's not picking up her cell.
No, she's out getting the dessert for the party-- Hawaiian shaved ice with all the best flavors, including everyone's favorite-- Tutti Frutti.
Don't worry.
I promise it will be a night that you never forget.
Oh, I'm sure about that.
Isn't it a little mean, you and all of Blair's friends are messing with her about tonight? Well, it might be the only event in Blair's entire life where she's not in control.
What about you? How was it reconnecting with your old friend, or should I say old boyfriend? Do you plan to see him again? No.
He took off back to Florida.
I'm sorry that you had to find out about the "Ivy" thing like that.
I'm the one that's sorry-- sorry your mother put you through that.
I hope you know you have family that cares about you, and you can always be your true self with us.
Thank you.
Come on, ladies.
I didn't hire you to watch movies.
Unless you wore my friend out already.
We tried, but he wouldn't stop complaining about some girl named Serena and wanting to be a man of action.
So when he mentioned something about a shower, we were like, "Yeah," but then he never came in to join us.
And by the time we got out, he was gone.
It's important to be careful about what you tell others.
What are you doing in here? Well, I was just going to check some e-mails until you finished getting dressed, mon ami.
I don't want you to get a big head about this, but perhaps you were right that my friends don't have quite my best interests at heart.
Why? What happened? My shower.
Doesn't sound like they're thinking of me at all.
You said I need to create some distance, but maybe the distance is already there.
How could it not be, when they say such terrible things behind your back? Ugh.
I'm not talking about "Gossip Girl.
" Oh.
I hadn't realized what time it was.
We're gonna be late for our own shower.
Come on.
Let's go.
Dorota, we're leaving! Call down to Jimmy to get our car.
Because sometimes your words can come back to haunt you.
It can happen to anybody, even me.
Louis, look, it's a Tiffany's party.
This isn't casual at all.
It's elegant, witty.
It's It's you.
Surprise! Oh, my gosh.
Oh, Serena! This is above and beyond anything I ever dreamed of.
Come on.
You deserve it.
No freakin' way.
What is it? What's going on? Did somebody famous die? Excuse me? Could I have everyone's attention, please? I'm not usually one for speeches, but I have to say how lucky I am to have Blair Waldorf as my best friend.
I may be the maid of honor, but the true honor is just knowing you, B.
There is simply no one like her, no matter how hard some of you try.
Congratulations to the beautiful bride.
You have become the strong, confident princess I always knew you would.
I love you so much and wish you and your prince nothing but happiness.
Cheers.
Cheers.
And one more thing.
We have a surprise for all the ladies tonight.
We'll be handing out boxes.
Most of us will open ours to find it empty, but one lucky lady will have a diamond ring inside.
But you have to wait until I say so to open it.
Enjoy.
Oh, thank you so much.
I hope you guys didn't mind my joke.
Oh, we didn't hear your speech.
We've been too busy reading.
Sorry.
Hi.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'm--as you can tell by my casual attire, I'm--I'm crashing this party, but But it's only because I needed to stop whining, start becoming a man of action.
And a man of action wouldn't just do nothing.
A man of action would, uh, would show up and finally confront the person he's been meaning to have a conversation with for a very long time now.
I wouldn't expect you to understand what I'm saying.
Who the hell are you people, anyway? Must be friends of the groom.
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
I'm on my way over right now.
I thought I told you not to post the "Gossip Girl" sources web page.
I didn't.
Well, somebody did, because there's a link to it on "The Spectator" right now.
What? Ohh.
Diana.
I can't believe she'd do this to me.
To you? To all of us.
Get her to take it down.
Well, I can try, but it's probably all over the Internet by now.
Just please fix it.
I have to go do damage control before Blair's entire shower is ruined.
All right, I'm on it.
No photos, please.
I thought you saw the invitation.
Privacy concerns.
Why did you tell that? I'm telling you, it wasn't me.
What else am I supposed to do? I knew you couldn't stay away.
Believe it or not, this is the last place I wanna be right now.
I'm not looking for trouble, just Dan Humphrey.
He's not very pleased with Serena right now, and in his inebriated state, I'm not sure what he'll do.
Why don't you ask him? I called you here because I saw a side of your grandson today I hadn't fully seen before.
And here I was, pretty sure that you've seen every side of him at this point.
He's not a boy anymore, William.
He's a man, and a good one at that, with a lot of integrity-- so much, in fact, that he inspired me to summon you here and tell you that I was willing to abandon my war with Gossip Girl to start a new war-- With you.
Is that so? I was planning to tell you that I've ended up caring more about this paper and your grandson than you ever will.
And then someone went off to Gossip Girl.
And that someone wasn't you.
No.
But I'm pretty sure Nate won't believe me when I tell him that.
Tell me what? Thank you for coming.
Did you see what Blair wrote about us? Penelope? Can you please tell me why people are not paying attention to me right now? 'Cause last I checked, this was supposed to be my night.
Okay, everyone! Now would be a great time to stop whatever it is you're doing or looking at and open those Tiffany boxes! Oh, my God! Oh! Charlie! I've never seen a ring like this before, never mind owned one.
Which is why I should put it someplace safe.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
What are you doing here? I know the truth.
You're Ivy Dickens.
The real Charlie Rhodes is in Florida.
We cannot have this conversation in here.
What would possess you to tell Gossip Girl about my shrine to Nate? Or my excess hair issues? Or that time I went commando at communion? Okay, okay, okay, it's fine, it's fine.
We're leaving now.
Oh, you know what? Just Oh, please, you've all said more slanderous things - Excuse me.
Excuse me.
than John Galliano after a couple cocktails.
Blair.
Oh, Dan.
Oh, thank God.
Someone who isn't mad at me.
Mm, that's not entirely true.
I need to know the real reason why you didn't invite me to this thing tonight.
'Cause I've been there for you when no one else was, and I refuse to believe that it's about my book.
I mean, I didn't write a bad word about you in the entire thing.
Ugh! You, too? Doesn't anyone know what "not invited" means? Is everything okay? Not even close! Can you handle this? All right.
Okay.
Please stay.
Enjoy some food.
Why did you do it, Serena? Do what? I saw the web page on your computer earlier.
Are you trying to sabotage Gossip Girl just for the sake of your blog, or just destroy my night? I created this night.
I did it all for you.
You know, Louis was right.
None of us here are really friends.
We just pretend to be so we can get stuff to talk about behind each other's backs.
B.
, I'll admit that I saw the web page, but I had nothing to do with it coming out.
I actually did everything I could to stop it, and I thought I succeeded.
Well, if you didn't do it, then who did? Diana.
She and Nate and I are the only people that saw the site.
And Louis, but Sorry, B.
Must be hard to keep your head above water when your prince is causing everyone around you to drown.
Can someone please explain to me what's going on here? I mean, are you two working together? Have you been working together this whole time? No, of course not.
Diana asked me to meet her here.
We just started talking when you came in.
I'm as much in the dark as you are.
Diana, is this true? As a matter of fact, I did call your grandfather.
After the board told me I was gonna lose my job if I didn't do something fast, I thought maybe he'd want to invest.
And what about releasing all of Gossip Girl's sources on the web? Another desperate job-saving measure on my part.
After I told you how much it would hurt the people I care about.
You looked me in the eye and acted like you understood.
It isn't personal.
It is to me.
Listen, Nate, I really care about-- Diana, I think I'd like to invest after all, with one condition-- your resignation letter goes to the board with my check.
I suppose that is what's best for "The Spectator" And everyone else.
I'll start gathering my things.
Come on, Ivy.
Tell me the truth.
Why does that woman think that she is your aunt? Why does she think that you are the nice young woman who played the queen of hearts in our local production of "Alice in Wonderland"? Yeah, I found this in a box of your things.
Look, I told you I'd get you the 50 grand.
I still can, and then we can go away together.
Ivy, everything you say is a lie.
But the money is real.
Prove it.
Consider it a down payment.
Now please, just stay away from me and my family, and I'll get you the rest in the next couple of days.
Okay, Ivy.
I'll make myself scarce.
Now go have fun with your family.
Really? You're really going to make me sit here on the stairs with you? Why don't you tell me why you antagonize Blair at her own wedding shower? I was just--I was just trying to take some action, man, like you said, but it didn't work.
Let's be clear.
I told you to get some ass, not make one of yourself.
It wasn't until I saw you confronting Blair that I realized I had it all wrong.
Wait.
Had what wrong? You're in love with her.
Nah.
I'm--I'm in-- I'm in love With Blair? No, no, no, no.
No, no.
I'm--I'm not I'm not in love with Blair.
You can blame it on your tell-all novel or your perennial status as an outsider, but we both know Blair doesn't care about any of that.
She follows her heart, and she chose Louis.
We both lost.
At least this time you have someone outside with you.
Now can we please get you home before someone sees me sitting here like this? It was you who posted that page, wasn't it? I was trying to show you what your friends are really like, once and for all.
You should have shown me at home.
You wanted this to happen.
It was more important to prove your point than our own shower.
You're not exactly innocent here.
I looked through some of those e-mails.
People say you and Chuck went to the theater while I was gone.
I only did that so I could prove to Chuck he hadn't changed, and in that case, you were actually right.
But I wasn't this time? Beatrice sent out the blast about the paternity test, Louis.
Well, okay.
So that's one thing out of a million that-- Stop! Just stop.
Do you see what we keep doing here? All the fights and accusations-- It isn't my friends.
It's us.
I thought we were better people than this.
But the only ones caught in a cycle are us.
The cycle created by your world in New York.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
You see those people leaving? Why don't you join them? I think I need time alone to think about the future of our relationship.
Guess this shower's officially over, and it looks like B.
's the one throwing in the towel.
I couldn't believe you would think I of all people would release that information to the world.
Do you have any idea how many things I've sent in to Gossip Girl over the years? Well, I've checked, and I sent twice as many as you.
I knew in my heart you didn't send it.
Louis just put all these ideas in my head that my friends were a destructive force.
But I think he's self-destructing, and he's taking our relationship down with him.
What are you gonna do about it? I don't know.
But promise me you won't tell anyone he's the one who revealed Gossip Girl's sources.
I don't want everyone to hate him as much as I do in this moment.
Of course, but can we talk about Chuck for a minute? He just had to find some excuse to crash the party tonight, didn't he? What? He wasn't crashing.
He was trying to stop Dan.
He was doing you a favor, believe it or not.
I thought you realized.
I just can't believe she'd go behind my back like that, you know? I thought that you know what? Forget it.
It doesn't matter what I thought.
Well, I know this is hard, but this is a good lesson for you.
We're usually blinded by the people that we care about the most.
But here's the good news-- with her leaving, the stink will be off the paper, which makes this a great investment opportunity.
Even after tonight? Well, that's the best part.
I-I think her plan will actually work, which means all of "Gossip Girl's" readers will flock to us, or, rather, to you, Mr.
New Editor-in-Chief.
Congratulations.
You've earned it.
Max.
What are you doing here? I'm sorry to surprise you.
The doorman let me in.
Well, usually when a guy stands a girl up, he doesn't show up at her house a week later.
Unless he's coming to apologize and tell her that there has been a huge misunderstanding.
Why didn't he at least call? 'Cause the girl deserved more than that.
And the guy would like the option to literally get down on his knees and beg her to give him a second chance.
If you would have stopped talking and just gotten on your knees, I probably would have said yes, but.
.
I'll--I'll Stop, please.
I forgive you.
You do? So that means you're willing to give me another shot? One more, but use it wisely.
I plan to.
You shouldn't be so upset.
Whether you did it or not, you got what you wanted.
I just wish I didn't have to destroy my relationship with Nate to do it.
He's young.
He'll get over it, and faster than if he found out the truth about you, too.
Which, by the way, is the only reason I fell on my sword for you tonight.
Yeah, I figured.
It's better this way.
You should be thankful you're getting out now before anyone discovered your secret.
Remember one thing, William.
If they find out about me, they find out about you, too.
Loyal readers, I'd like to apologize to all of you for the awful and embarrassing breach of security that happened tonight.
In bad times like this, you have many options.
Hello, Ivy.
Looks like I'm gonna be staying in New York a little longer than I thought, plus I'd like to have a little more cash to play with while I'm here.
$50,000 isn't gonna cut it.
How about we up it to $500,000? You can choose to go on the offensive and come out swinging Or you can pack your bags and admit defeat Or you can drink yourself into oblivion and hope it will all just go away.
Whatever I choose to do to win back your trust, one thing is certain-- This is not the end between us.
You shouldn't be here.
I know.
But I had to come.
You've really been good this whole time, haven't you? 'Cause try as you might to fight it, you know you love me.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here.
Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
My goal was to remake Nate, not to make you the star.
It's time for you to step aside, which means that all her readers will flock to you, Mr.
New Editor-in-chief.
Ivy? Max.
My ex-boyfriend just shows up out of nowhere.
The truth is gonna come out any second.
I'm looking for someone named Ivy.
I think some people here might call her "Charlie.
" My mom never wanted me to grow up with the burden of the Rhodes name.
I knew your mother was behind this.
Everything you say is a lie.
The money is real.
Just stay away from me and my family.
I forgive you.
So that means you're willing to give me a shot? One more.
Can you please tell me why people are not paying attention to me right now? It was you who uploaded that page, wasn't it? I was trying to show you what your friends are really like.
I think I need time alone to think about the future of our relationship.
You've really been good this whole time, haven't you? On the Upper East Side, stayin' alive isn't as easy as it appears.
And after last week's security breach leading to no new tips, it looks like I might be dancing with myself.
I've never seen so much lame before.
But grandma actually wore this? Yes, and looked fabulous riding in on an elephant in it, which is why the Studio is in her honor and Bianca Jagger's, but we won't mention that to her when she arrives.
Bianca was a striver.
She could never outshine me no matter how little she wore.
Oh, mother! It's wonderful to see you.
Darling.
Charlotte.
Oh, New York agrees with you.
You look fabulous.
I just got off the phone with Ian Schrager.
He sends his love.
He said he's recreating the entire club down to the moon and the spoon.
And I am going to wear that platinum jumpsuit that prompted Ryan O'Neal to propose.
Oh! Now that he's a widower, I put him on the guest list.
Speaking of which, what did you decide to do about inviting Carol? I thought I'd leave the drama this year up to Barry and Diane.
Yes, well, she does have a way of blowing things up.
I have all the family I need with you and my two favorite granddaughters.
Quite an accomplishment for my blog and for you, country boy.
I grew up in Miami.
I was impressed by your moves at Bunker Hill.
I can't feel my feet, and for once, I can't blame Alaia or Giuseppe.
Ah, I don't know those dudes.
I do know those 4AM soup dumplings put David Chang to shame.
Momofuk-who? And what about absinthe at Apotheke? And the sunrise over the high line? How can anyone not love New York? Well, if you're not sick of me yet, you wanna show me some more later today? I would love to, but I have this thing at Studio 54.
My grandma is the guest of honor, which would shock you if you ever met her.
But, uh, I promised I'd pick up the cake.
Why would you trust an anonymous baker when you have a master chef in your midst? You could be my sous for the afternoon.
Could we cover ourselves in flour and lick spoons and do other cute things? That's a prerequisite.
Then I can't wait to don my chef whites.
I'll call you later.
Okay.
Oh.
Now that's what I like to see-- you writing again.
What is it? Sophomore novel? Short story? Well, it's more like a rebuttal.
These online haters are like cockroaches.
You kill one, and then three more pop up in its place.
You're not seriously being the kind of author that fights every negative review on Amazon? I mean, people will think you've lost your mind.
Which is why I have Danfan, the tireless online avatar I've created to fend off critics.
Alessandra isn't returning my calls, so I gotta fight this battle on my own.
That's it.
I stayed quiet while you crashed bridal showers and skipped out on book tours.
I was hoping with enough time and support that you'd realize that even though your book didn't do as well as you hoped, you still have your whole future ahead of you.
Being a shut-in is not bouncing back.
I was defending my honor.
It's time to leave "Inside" behind and go outside.
Cece's party's tonight.
I expect you to be there.
Looks like I'm not the only one everyone despises.
Lonely boy's fans are slowly dwindling, but his haters are going forth and multiplying.
My personal favorite? @ihatehumphrey.
Why should I thank someone for a blender? Do I look like the kind of girl who makes margaritas? Oh, margarita sounds delicious.
But six month away at least.
Any correspondence from Mr.
Louis? No.
I told you.
He's doing missionary work with Father Cavalia in some nation without plumbing and waiting for my call.
But wedding still on? Of course it is.
I still love Louis.
I just want to marry the sweet prince who returned my Vivier slipper and made me believe in fairy tales, not one of the Brothers Grimm.
Even Prince Charming can fall off horse.
But Louis still hasn't found his way back in the saddle.
Shocking for someone schooled in classical dressage.
I need this time apart to figure out where Louis went wrong and right it.
Maybe he "Freaky Friday" with Mr.
Chuck.
They struck by lightning at same time, that's incredibly unsanitary.
But you may be on to the key to returning Louis' virtue.
I am? Finish these.
No Polish parables.
I know I'm the new kid around here and I'm gonna make some mistakes.
I just want you guys to know that I'm not gonna resort to the kind of dirty tactics that Diana used.
"Spectator" only publishes truth.
And yeah, s*x sells, but if the story involves scandal, it needs to be verified.
We have an opportunity to do things differently here.
So I'm around if anyone has any stories they'd like to pitch.
Thanks.
Nate? I've got a lead on a famous congressman's wife who's having an affair.
Well, we've heard that story a million times.
Do we have a new angle? What was going on in Washington at the time? Does the wife want to come clean? Dig deeper.
Before I do, you should know the congressman is your cousin Trip Van Der Bilt.
You got my money yet? I'm working on it.
I can't just walk into a bank and withdraw $500,000.
Well, in case you're lying, like you do about everything else, I found myself an insurance policy.
In fact, I'm dating her-- Serena Van Der Woodsen.
Have you heard of her? What? Y-you can't date Serena.
Too late.
And unless I get the money soon, one of our dates will involve a bottle of champagne and revelations about who you really are.
Uh, should I show her this playbill I keep in my pocket before or after the caviar? I told you.
I just need a little more time.
Why can't you leave Serena out of it? Because I'm having fun with her.
Listen The more she likes me, the more she trusts me, and the more likely she is to believe me when I tell her that Charlie Rhodes is just a white trash wannabe named Ivy Dickens.
Well, don't let Lily see you together.
She knows our history, and if she tells Serena that we used to date, she'll get suspicious.
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna risk a lifetime of financial security for brunch with the in-laws.
Hi.
We have a problem.
Yeah, well, add this one to the list.
Max is dating Serena.
If you don't me to leave or get caught, we have to pay him off immediately.
Except we don't have the money.
I just came from the bank.
Turns out my mother's added a security measure to the account-- probably to punish me.
Any withdrawal over $50,000 requires her signature, which she will never agree to if we ask.
We have to make her think it was her idea.
I barely know her, and she's not speaking to you.
The money is the only thing that will stop Max from outing me.
You keep Serena away from Max.
I will work on my mother.
Looks like I'm not the only one doing the hustle.
Perhaps I should feather my hair tonight.
I never really understood why it went out of fashion.
For you, mother.
From Ryan.
How thoughtful.
Although I prefer Vanda orchids.
Mm-hmm.
How about lilies of the valley? More like "Valley of the Dolls" now that you've arrived.
I am here to reconstruct, not self-destruct.
I promise.
To honor the guest of honor.
I hope my invitation was lost in the mail.
It's a lovely thought, but it wasn't.
So what do you really want? Forgiveness.
If this is about my cutting off Charlie's funds I admit I made some mistakes in trying to protect her.
But she's forgiven me.
In fact, we're closer than ever.
Funny.
She lives with me, and this is the first I'm hearing of this.
Well, why else would she suggest I come for the party? We're both hoping that Studio 54 would bring the Rhodes girls back together.
Well, you know, nothing makes me happier than when my family gets along.
That is, if you both can do that.
Of course, mother.
It's your night.
However, I will not tolerate any outbursts or judgmental tantrums.
I am supposed to be the center of attention tonight, and I'd like to keep it that way.
I promise.
Now let's get those flowers into some water.
Um, how could you be working when you have a date to be discussed? Spill! Well, there's not much to say.
Max and I spent the whole night together, wandering the city.
Is this the same Max that was supposed to meet you at "Sleep No More"? Yes, but if I wouldn't have given him a second chance, I never would've seen how great he is.
We're spending the afternoon baking Cece a cake.
Is that not the sweetest thing you've ever heard? Sure If he hadn't stood you up once already.
Maybe you shouldn't rush into this.
Where is this coming from? You were the one who encouraged me to get out there and date.
Well I mean, for your blog.
Now that that's a bona fide success, I just don't wanna see you revert to old Serena's taste in men.
Oh, Max could not be further from the men I've dated.
He moved here from Portland.
He hikes.
Okay.
Maybe he hasn't done hard time like the last one.
But didn't you say he came to New York to find his ex-girlfriend? Yeah, I forgot about her.
Ivy.
I mean, he did cross the country to see her.
Part of him must still love her.
Well, anyway, two dates in one day could be-- could be moving too fast.
Always better to leave 'em wanting more.
Okay, I'll cancel my baking date.
Oh, I have to reorder the cake now.
Yeah.
I have to go get Cece some glitter eye shadow.
She said something about lighting up the night with her liner.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
Namaste.
Sorry to interrupt you getting into someone's yoga pants.
Sri Sri Ravi, a moment, please.
An old, celibate, male yoga teacher? Your transformation really is astounding.
Care to share how you gave up your bad Bass ways? How you went from Charlie Sheen to Charlie Brown, from Bar to Mitzvah? There's no answer to that question.
It's an evolution.
Mm.
What's really going on, Blair? Okay, if you must know, I'm trying to pinpoint the source of your light so I can pull Louis out of the darkness.
You changed.
So can he.
I have all day.
Oh, it was great meeting your new staff.
From what I can see, Jared Kushner better watch his back.
Thanks.
Before you leave, there's something I need to tell you.
One of my reporters received a tip.
Maureen's cheating on Trip.
Well, there must some mistake.
Maureen's a devoted wife.
She even stuck by Trip during that, uh, unfortunate incident with Serena.
Obviously, we'll verify everything first.
You're not seriously considering running it? Well, the information's out there, and if we don't, someone else will.
And I don't wanna make a certain Australian patriarch's mistake of burying the "News of the World" scandal.
If he'd let the "Journal" break it, he might've saved his paper and a lot of embarrassment.
But, uh, this is a family matter.
And a public one, unfortunately.
It's our chance to prove that "The Spectator" is fair and balanced no matter what the story is.
The site and our family will be in better shape for running it first.
Well, I certainly don't want it in the hands of the "Post.
" I won't run anything before I talk to Trip.
I was wrong in keeping you from here.
The city looks good on you.
I just wish I could visit more often.
But, you know, Lily's doing so much by letting you stay here.
I just I don't know.
I don't feel comfortable by putting her out.
I never thought I would say this, maybe it's time to get your own place.
Yeah, but the prices are so crazy.
You've got more than that in your trust fund.
We could get you a beautiful 1-bedroom, it's better to buy it than rent it.
It's--it's-- it's a good investment.
That's enough.
Do you have me pegged as a fool? Coming here under the guise of a party and trying to get me to buy you an apartment? It's not for me.
It's for Charlie.
If it was Charlie, she would have asked me herself.
Once again, Carol, you're all dollars and no sense.
And I am done being taken advantage of and enabling your agendas.
My only agenda is to get closer to my daughter-- something you'll never understand.
I'm going for a walk, on the streets, where I'm welcome.
Mom, please.
Grandma.
Grandma, are you all right? Yes.
O-of course I am.
Maybe I should call an ambulance.
Oh, no, honey.
Your--your-- your mother just triggered my blood pressure, that's all.
Are you sure? O-of course.
You know, if you wanna be helpful, just, um, go get me a glass of water so so I can take my pill.
Yeah, okay.
Hey, Max, it's Serena.
Listen, I have to take a rain check.
My cousin and I have a lot to do before the party.
If you ever find yourself sick with Saturday night fever, the last thing you want is for someone to turn up the heat.
Oh, my gosh! Max, that's beautiful! I had the ingredients.
I hope your grandmother enjoys it.
Now I'm going to leave before you think I'm a stalker who shows up for canceled dates.
No, stop it.
I don't.
I really did want to see you.
I just--I didn't wanna move too fast.
No, I get it.
met is more than enough.
To be honest, I thought maybe you weren't quite over your ex yet.
When we met, you--you were still looking for her.
Just to return her stuff.
I haven't thought about Ivy since we met, Serena.
I swear.
Well, how would you like to come with me to Studio 54 tonight and present the cake to my grandmother yourself? You do realize you just went from "let's take it slow" to "want to meet my family?" Right? Caution is not my strong suit.
Well, how about we try something in between? Uh, you liveblog with party updates, and I'll pick you up tomorrow afternoon.
That sounds perfect.
Thank you.
No, thank you.
Are you sure you don't want me to call a doctor? Oh, yes, no.
I just need some rest, and, you know, the jet lag, and of course I didn't eat anything this morning.
That's ginger tea.
I knew someone who took those pills.
The ginger helps with the dizziness.
Tell me.
What does your mother want your money for? Be honest, Charlotte.
I'm not gonna let her bully you.
It wasn't her.
It's me that wants the apartment.
She was just trying to help to make it seem like it was her idea.
Well, I wish you'd just been honest.
Although growing up with Carol, I mean, how would you know better? You've been so generous.
I didn't wanna ask for more.
Well, now that you have, I will uncap my waterman and release the funds tomorrow morning.
Thank you! Listen, I'm sorry I had to be the one to tell you.
Yeah, I doubt that.
I'm sure you're enjoying every second of this.
I know our history isn't exactly pristine, Trip, but we're still family.
God, with her sailing instructor? Really? I should have known when she kept asking to leave grandfather's compound a week early.
And you were there all of August, right? Yeah.
Yeah.
I, um It's funny.
Usually she complains about having to go back to D.
C.
Look, man, we really worked on our marriage after the whole Serena situation.
I just thought we were on the right track.
I'm sorry.
Look, I get you have to run the story.
Just I hope you don't let your personal feelings against me make it any uglier than it has to be.
Thanks for telling me.
I guess now we're even.
Hey, grandfather, it's Nate.
I'm gonna wait on that story.
I think Maureen's lying about the affair.
I just don't know why.
Next one over.
Uh, excuse me, sir? Do you know who lives here? Don't worry.
I'm not a stalker.
In fact, the person I'm looking for is the stalker-- an anonymous one, the worst kind.
No? Dan? Alessandra? What are you doing here? I live here.
Isn't that why you buzzed my apartment? That's usually how it works.
No, actually, I was looking for someone who hates me.
Chuck? Are you sure you're comfortable with Blair here? I don't believe I have a choice, which is why I'm controlling the information.
Which, thus far, has been a bunch of monkey business.
I'm worried his licking himself is anxiety, that he's lonely.
Enough.
Assuming this is a 50-minute session, I only have 18 minutes left to get my answers.
And what is it you're searching for, Blair? Nice try on the bait and switch, but I was a teenage bulimic, and my father came out when I was 15.
This isn't my first analysis.
What I need for you is to show me how you helped Chuck transform.
I told you, Blair.
There is no one answer.
There isn't one, or you don't want to give it to me because you don't want me to fix Louis? Are you saying that you want your fiance to be more like Chuck? No! More like the man Chuck's become, like Louis used to be when Chuck was like Louis is now.
If you don't mind me saying so, you seem confused.
Only by Chuck's refusal to disclose.
If he really is a good person, why doesn't he tell me how he got that way? Obviously, he hasn't really let go, or he would give me the information I need.
You mean let go of the intimacy between you? You said it, not me, and you're the expert.
But I did let go of you, Blair.
Then prove it by telling me how.
I can't.
But if you don't believe me, call on Harry Winston.
The night of "The Spectator" launch, I left the engagement ring I bought you on their doorstep and walked away.
I forgot I, uh I have a cake tasting to attend.
You blow Cheryl Ladd out of the water.
Oh, thank you, my darling.
Too bad Carol's arrival has put a pall over the entire evening.
Well, hopefully we can get her to dance the night away and hustle her the hell out of here.
It is taking every ounce of self-control not to march over and tell her what a terrible mother I think she is.
She heard you loud and clear.
Come on, Lil.
Say what you really think for a change.
Okay, I'll let you two talk alone.
Last month you were happy to see me and take care of my daughter.
What could I have done to mortally offend you all the way from Florida? Charlie told me you made her live under the name of "Ivy Dickens.
" As if being a teenager isn't enough of an identify crisis without having to assume a false one.
How dare you.
You know nothing about Charlie or our relationship.
I know you put your hatred of our family above her well-being.
What else is there? I assure you that being Ivy is the only thing that saved Charlie from the despicable fate of being a Rhodes.
Hey, Max, it's Serena.
So it turns out the party tonight was canceled, and I have my mom's apartment all to myself if you wanna come celebrate being over Ivy with me.
We do have cake, after all.
Chaka Khan might have been every woman, but looks like Charlie Rhodes is about to have trouble being two.
I wish you wouldn't take it as a negative.
It's called "I hate Humphrey.
" Yeah, to get people talking about you and your book.
Sugar and spice and everything nice get no attention.
s*x taps and public brawls make people famous.
I'm not--I'm not Snooki.
I'm a writer.
Who skipped out on his book tour.
My career's on the line here, too.
I took a chance on a young, inexperienced author.
I was trying to get you back on the radar.
I knew you wouldn't like the method, but if it makes you feel better, there's a Twitter called "Humphrey Love," too.
That's me.
Oh.
Sorry.
I should've recognized your scalpel-sharp self-deprecation.
Well, I have over a thousand followers.
Yeah.
Let's hope they bought books.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
I'll close the account.
No.
I have a better idea.
When Trip told me he and Maureen were with you all of August, something didn't feel right.
That's when one of my reporters said she was spotted with her sailing instructor.
She could have snuck down to D.
C.
for a night or two, I'd imagine.
Which is why I called the club.
Turns out the only sailing lessons Maureen ever took were from a woman named Heather two years ago.
Are you saying Maureen's faking an affair? Yeah.
It wouldn't be the first time she's faked something.
Think of what it would do to Trip.
It would hurt him immeasurably.
Or help him.
Trip just hired a new campaign manager to explore running for governor.
The last time he needed help in the polls, Maureen hired someone to jump in the Hudson so Trip could look like a hero.
So now she's making him into a victim? It seems like a risky move.
Oh, well, think about it.
A politician out there fighting for the good in Washington, while his wife steps out on him at the yacht club? It's a sympathetic story.
I can't believe that Maureen would risk her marriage.
Oh, she'd make a public apology and go to counseling, convince him it'd be better for his career to stay together, and in two years, when his name's on that ballot, people will remember him as a guy who fought through a rough patch to save his family.
It's pretty shrewd.
At least you won't have to run the story of her affair.
No, I'll just run this one instead.
I understand you're, um, upset by Maureen's manipulations, but Trip was completely in the dark about her antics with that river rescue.
I'm sure this is the same now.
Oh, this is not a story.
This is a family squabble that could 'cause your cousin his career.
I'll do the right thing.
Don't worry.
I have no idea.
They're all so delicious.
I agree.
Every morsel is like taste of heaven.
But you must choose top three choices before Sylvia Weinstock, Queen of Cake, arrives.
How can I choose my wedding cake when my groom has lost his sweetness? Peeing in fountain was not answer? Stop mentioning that, or I'll never be able to toss a coin in again, and I need all the wishes I can get.
I get us some milk.
So much cake make baby kick up storm.
What are you doing here? Why did you walk out of therapy? You weren't going to reveal your secrets, and I have cakes to taste, so if you'll excuse me, I haven't even begun the buttercream.
Dr.
Krueger thought you were upset I returned the ring.
He has too many PhDs.
They cancel each other out and make him a moron.
I returned it because you asked me to let you go.
I wanted to move on to give you the happy life you deserve.
All this time, I've blamed you for pulling me into the dark.
But I was wrong.
It was me who brought out your dark side.
And now that I'm with Louis, I've done the same to him.
I'm sorry.
These glasses of champagne used to be served with a White Lady appetizer.
Uh, mother, since we have a little time before the party, Rufus and I have a small gift for you.
Opening night.
I tracked it down for you.
How surprisingly thoughtful.
If I had any memory of that night, I'm sure it would be fond.
Her favoritism is nauseating.
Now is not the time to be mad at Cece.
All she has to do is sign a paper tomorrow, and we're in the clear.
You're a better actress than I thought.
You got more out of her in three minutes than I have in 45 years.
I was just kind to her.
Maybe you should try it.
She is getting older.
And meaner.
You don't know these people.
They're my family, not yours.
Remember that.
Of course.
Sorry.
Get me out of the dress.
Mom! Mother, let me see! Goodness.
Oh, your body looks amazing.
Max.
What are you doing here? Serena said to meet her here, said the party was canceled.
Well, it's not.
If Lily sees you here, everything will be ruined.
I see you two found have each other.
No need for introductions, right, Max and Ivy? Serena, this isn't what it looks like.
Oh, so you two didn't used to date? We did.
And you didn't pretend like you've never met? We did.
And you didn't try to convince me not to see him again because he may still be hung up on his ex, Ivy? Uh, girls, this is not the time.
We need to get to grandma's party.
Max, nice to see you again.
Wait.
You know him, too? This is insane.
I'm not going anywhere until Charlie's alter ego, who everyone seems to know about but me, explains what's going on here.
It's not her fault.
Carol had her live as Ivy because she hated being a Rhodes.
You can't blame Charlie for her own mother's insanity.
My insanity? Is this how you get along for mom's sake? What's for my sake? I just want the truth, Charlie.
I invited you back to New York.
My mom and Rufus gave you somewhere to live.
Cece got you your trust fund back.
Now just stop lying and tell me what you and your boyfriend are up to.
Just when things are about to hit the fan, they hit the ground instead with a thud.
Mother.
Mother? Her pulse feels okay.
Okay, give me your jacket.
I'm gonna put it under her head.
I'll call an ambulance.
No, please.
I'm all right.
No, don't get up too quickly.
You fainted from the stress.
Don't you try and pin this on me.
Mother, are you all right? I will be when you let me off the floor.
Okay, let's get you somewhere more comfortable.
Up you go.
Okay.
Okay.
Look, you still look pale.
I think we should call Dr.
Sue.
I'm not gonna wait around for some concierge doctor.
We're gonna take you to the hospital.
Okay, let's get her over here.
I told you, I'm fine.
I know what's wrong.
Yeah, you keep this apartment excessively warm.
Just tell them, grandma.
She's been dieting to fit into her jumpsuit.
A few Martinis and glasses of champagne on an empty stomach, and anyone would pass out.
Well, Charlotte's right.
I'm afraid that I let my vanity get the better of me, but, um, something delicious to eat will fix me right up.
Comfort food-- that's something I'm good at.
So why don't you go ahead-- ahead of me, darling? Oh, don't be silly, mother.
We'll have our own celebration.
Once we get grandma something to eat and make sure she's okay, Charlie can get back to telling us everything.
Thanks.
It's so nice working for someone who means what he says.
Yeah.
Well, let's, uh Let's hope everyone feels the same way.
"We at 'The Spectator' are the voice of honesty, "not the wealthy or politically connected.
"Recently a family member tried to manipulate our site "for personal and political gain.
"We're not going to name names.
"We're not going to post the story or bury it, "but instead we're coming to you with the promise "that we will never let money, power, or personal agendas get in the way of reporting the truth.
" Told you I'd do the right thing.
I'm sorry if we have different versions of what that is.
I'm not here to reprimand you.
You remind me of myself when I was your age.
Wait.
You're not angry that I alluded to Maureen? You're your own man, Nathaniel.
I've always loved you.
But now well, I respect you, too.
You never pulled me to the dark side, Blair.
I appreciate you trying to make me feel better, but I have my answer.
You were the lightest thing that ever came into my life.
Then why did it take letting me go to find this whole new side of yourself? I only turned dark and desperate because I was afraid of losing you.
Your love kept me alive.
But you survived without me.
The worst thing happened, and I didn't die.
But I had to find a new way to move on with my life.
I only want you to be happy.
I'm just sorry it couldn't be with me.
Oh, Blair, there you are.
I brought some more samples with me.
I see the groom is here, too.
I'm not the groom.
When I saw you in L.
A.
, I lied and didn't tell you that Max was my boyfriend or that I was living under the name Ivy Dickens.
Who's Ivy Dickens? I'm sorry, mother.
That was my fault.
I didn't want anyone to find out that she was a Rhodes and use her for her money, which is exactly what Max is doing.
I'm not the one using you people.
She is.
He's blackmailing me.
Is that what you wanted the money for? Not for an apartment? He manipulated me into doing things I'm not proud of.
What are you talking about? He has a tape that he was threatening to expose.
I was worried he was gonna do the same to you, Serena.
That's why I tried to get you to stop seeing him.
I don't have a tape.
Why didn't you just tell me the truth? I just tried to pay him off, get rid of him.
I-I can't believe you people are buying this.
She's scamming you.
She is not Charlie Rhodes.
She's Ivy Dickens.
She's a wannabe actress from Florida.
I think we've heard enough of your lies.
And you're not even her real mother.
She grew up in trailer parks.
Her father was a heroin addict who died right in front of her when she was 8 years old.
That's just what I told him to make him believe I was Ivy.
I have proof.
You took it.
Enough.
This is my granddaughter, Charlie Rhodes.
I was there the day she was born.
She is my family.
I don't need any proof.
I know it in my bones.
You should go before we call the police.
Just remember I warned all of you.
Sister Sledge sang "We Are Family," but she had nothing on the Rhodes girls.
I'm sorry again.
I should have had enough faith in our friendship to be able to tell you the truth.
No, it's okay, but I do see why you fell for Max.
I mean, he seemed perfect.
Too bad he was just seeing me to get to you.
You'll find someone great.
Mm, I hope so.
But at least Max left his cake.
I think I'm gonna get some more champagne.
Can I, uh, interrupt your slide? Yeah, you know, I think I'll go find an extra fondue set.
I'm sorry about changing Charlie's name.
It took mom fainting for me to realize why you were so upset about it.
I just want us all to be Rhodes for as long as we have left.
Me, too.
It's just another example of my overprotective parenting getting the best of me.
I may have been a little quick to judge again, but it's only because I've come to love Charlie as if she were my own.
Great.
Now she'll have two moms to screw her up.
Oh, I love this song.
Thank you for discretion earlier.
No problem.
But, um You know, if you're really sick, I think you should tell the family.
They might care more than you think.
Perhaps.
But I appreciate you protecting my secret.
We all have them.
It's a Rhodes family tradition.
That's not nearly mean enough.
Here, let's switch.
I'll be hate.
You be love.
"Talk about by-the-numbers.
Humphrey's more Hardy boy than Hemingway.
" Impressive.
I've been at this a while.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Katy Perry just retweeted us.
What? She's--she's got like 9 million followers.
Those are best-seller numbers.
You went full Jerry Maguire, and your family approved.
Sounds like a successful editorial to me.
I must say, being in control felt pretty damn good As will losing it.
How was your day with Blair? Did you teach her how to turn Louis around? I told her the truth.
The whole truth? You should work for "The Spectator.
" I just wish I had the courage to do it sooner.
I've finally become the man she wanted, and she's already chosen another one.
I'm too late.
You still love her, huh? I can't imagine the day I won't.
Long after the clubs have closed, disco inferno rages on.
For some, it's burning desire that keeps them awake at night.
Miss Blair, if you finally find key to bring Mr.
Louis back to castle, why you not look like perky self? Just tell him he will not lose you, and he will be prince again.
I can find time difference so you can call him in third world country.
No.
I need to rest.
All that wedding cake made me sick.
You're dismissed.
For others, it's the flames of uncertainty that plague them.
Looks like we're finally in the clear.
You can leave anytime you want.
Would it be okay with you if I stay? You have enough money.
You could set yourself up anywhere in the world.
It's not about the money for me.
In fact, you can have all of it.
Then What do you want? A family.
I'm sorry.
I never knew that you'd had such a troubled upbringing.
I swiped this when Max took off his jacket.
I'll make sure no one ever sees this.
Thanks.
Well, if they ever found out the truth about the real Charlotte Rhodes, they would never forgive me.
This way, we both get to keep our family.
What do you want? My life back-- the move to Los Angeles, the job I gave up with Boulud, the two years I spent believing you and loving you when all you did was lie and cheat so you could have some fancy life that isn't yours.
You better watch your back, because I am not leaving town until I get what I deserve.
Good luck with that.
No one touch me anymore.
I'm a Rhodes now.
If you're going to play with matches, make sure you don't leave them around to spark the flame anew.
Disco isn't actually dead, and neither am I.

Gossip Girl here-- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
She's not Charlie Rhodes.
She's Ivy Dickens.
She's a wannabe actress from Florida.
You should go before we call the police.
I'm not leaving town until I get what I deserve.
No one can touch me anymore.
I'm a Rhodes now.
Maureen's cheating on Trip.
There must be some mistake.
Maureen's a devoted wife.
Look, I get you have to run the story, just I hope you don't let your personal feelings against me make it any uglier than it has to be.
I'll admit that I saw the web page, but I had nothing to do with it coming out.
Well, if you didn't do it, then who did? Do you see those people leaving? Why don't you join them? It wasn't until I saw you confronting Blair that I realized I had it all wrong.
You're in love with her.
I'm not in love with Blair.
You've really been good this whole time, haven't you? I wanted to move on to give you the happy life you deserve.
I only turned dark and desperate because I was afraid of losing you.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

Apologies have been made and the security breach fixed.
But two weeks later, and still not one tip.
Apparently, no one can hold a grudge like an Upper East Sider And no one can lie like one, either.
Here's to Charlie, who's learning it's never too late to be a debutante, and to mom, who couldn't refuse one last ball.
Oh! It's not a ball.
It's just a little party to introduce my darling niece into society.
Just because Carol made a mockery of her own debut does not mean that Charlie should be cheated out of the experience.
Yeah, she hired Karen Finley to go in her place, and when Carol's name was called, Karen walks out wearing nothing but chocolate and a pillbox hat.
Now I'm a Karen Finley fan, but it was a bit much.
We were barred from the Plaza for years.
Well I'm honored.
And if the party wasn't enough, Lily arranged for me to spend the day at the Plaza Athenee Spa.
It's way too generous, especially after everything I put you guys through with Max.
Oh, please.
That was not your fault.
That young man had a lot of problems.
No wonder Serena was so into him.
Anyway, I'm just eager to put this all behind me and start a new chapter in my life.
Oh, and, um, I got a job to help.
Nate offered me my old position back.
Waffles, a new job, and a party in your honor? Not a bad day to be Charlie Rhodes.
Not a bad day to be Dan Humphrey either.
It seems like being the target of a Twitter war pays off.
"Inside" is doing so well that Simon & Schuster is giving it a second printing.
Yeah, my editor wants to-- to publish it with a-- a new afterword now.
So I-I-I have no idea what to write.
I'm starting to understand the appeal of heroin or womanizing or--or whatever it is writers do when they can't write.
It's hard to find inspiration when you're not trashing your friends, huh? Well, at least I don't have the added pressure of it being turned into a movie, so thank you for that.
All right, that's enough.
You two should not be fighting like this.
It's time to work it out.
Yeah, I'm coming into the office now, but you gotta cancel that meeting with Bloomberg.
There's just too much going on today.
Yeah, sounds good.
Thank you.
A week ago, you couldn't get Bloomberg to give you a quote to "The Spectator.
" Now you're canceling on him? That's a bold move, Nathaniel.
I'm almost aroused.
Yeah, well, ever since I published that article about staying independent from my family, people are paying attention.
So you're finally learning there are upsides to pissing off your family.
Grandfather actually loved the editorial, so much so that he invited me to be his guest at Camp Allen this weekend.
Yeah.
I leave for Vermont after work.
Yeah, you, Warren Buffet, and every other finance and media titan.
World domination by day, debauchery by night.
The Allen retreat is legendary.
I pity the fool who tries to hire a call girl in Manhattan this weekend.
Yeah.
So I have to ask you, why are you reading a rival paper, huh? They might call the wedding off? Does this--does this mean that--that you I'm sure it's not even true.
You should know better than anyone these stories are invented to sell papers to women who collect ceramic cats.
Yeah, still, maybe you should give her a call.
Louis is the father of her child.
There's no way Blair's walking away from that.
Same thing happening to me.
Pregnancy makes fingers swell up like kielbasas.
Well, the paparazzi aren't camped out downstairs to find out if your wedding is called off.
They see me without my ring, they'll think it means something.
I start to think maybe it does.
Mr.
Louis is back from third world.
It's been a week, and he is still waiting at the consulate-- where he'll remain until I decide what to do.
You know what to do.
Mr.
Chuck told you secret to making Louis good man again.
Say like magic spell-- "Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo, I will never leave you" Poof! Louis will feel safe again, and you live happily ever after.
But I'm not sure I can promise Louis that I'll never leave him.
Handsome prince who is father of your child loves you.
What is stopping you? Nothing! But unlike you, I-I don't just marry the first person who asks me.
It is the thought of Mr.
Chuck that makes you unsure.
Of course not! Well, I will admit that Chuck has changed, but this is about Louis, and until I can promise him he'll never lose me, or my fingers regain their elegant shape, we are not leaving this apartment.
That could be very long time.
We are going nowhere.
This is New York.
We can live on takeout for months.
I'm sorry I assumed you were trying to sabotage my book being made into a movie.
I'm sorry, too, that it didn't work out.
I really did wanna make it happen for you, Dan.
But that's--that's great about the second print of "Inside.
" You'll be able to figure out the afterward.
I'm not so sure, though.
I-I've never been stuck like this before.
What? It seems like an amazing opportunity to see how the book changed you, how--how it changed everyone.
Did it really change anyone? Yes! Seeing where our characters ended made us realize exactly where we didn't want to be.
Nate didn't want to be half a person, and now he's running "The Spectator.
" And Chuck went from dying alone to therapy.
What about you? Well, I thought I changed my ending by getting the job with Jane or this blog, but the truth is, I'm still making horrible decisions in my love life.
I actually envy you.
You get this book where you get to see your journey and see what choices you would make differently, where you went off track.
I wish I had something like that.
Well, if you really are looking for a history of Serena Van Der Woodsen, there's always "Gossip Girl.
" I know, I know, I know, but it's not like she hasn't chronicled your entire life since grammar school.
What harm could it be to look at a few old blasts? I think maybe you'd learn something you didn't expect.
Um, Charlie's leaving and needs her coat.
Okay.
I'll bring it to her.
Thank you, Dan.
Good luck.
How'd it go? Well, Serena just pointed out how the ending of my book changed Everyone except me, of course.
Well, it's not too late to change.
How? Writing-wise? Life-wise? I wouldn't know where to begin.
Well for starters Blair? I'm very observant.
And not to mention, you haven't really dated anyone since that kiss with Blair last spring.
Blair's getting married and having a baby with Louis.
And if she wasn't with Louis, she'd be with Chuck, not me.
Maybe.
Even if Blair doesn't feel the same way, it might be worth it for you to tell her how you feel.
At least so you can move on.
I think the last time I saw you concentrating that hard, you were reading the instructions on how to assemble a hookah.
Trip! Hey, man.
What are you doing here? I had a meeting across the street, figured I'd stop in and say hey.
But, uh, I'll let you get back to it.
We're still on for racquetball tomorrow? Oh, actually, grandfather's taking me out to the Allen retreat tonight.
Yeah.
I thought you knew.
No.
I didn't.
Oh.
Well I'm sure it was just, you know, a last-minute decision and everything.
I'm sorry he can't bring both of us.
Actually, it's okay.
No, the reason he asked you is because I backed out.
Truth is, I couldn't stand to be around him right about now.
Well why? What happened? Well, Maureen and I have been having some issues since she tried to release the fake affair story.
But something wasn't adding up.
She finally admitted that grandfather was behind the whole thing.
What? Why didn't she say something before? It was causing a tremendous strain on our marriage, and she got scared.
He made her do it.
And just because he said it was to help my campaign, it doesn't make it okay.
No, of course not.
Anyway, I'm sorry to burden you with this.
Maybe it's better for you to know now, before you go away with him because he manipulated you, too.
DVD on prenatal yoga.
Maybe we use this time to get in shape for childbirth.
I plan on having my child the old-fashioned way-- fully sedated.
And the only downward dog I wanna see you doing is cleaning up the dust from under that couch.
Please.
I'm not even safe in my own home! I have to get out of here! Somewhere they'd never think to look for me We go to Dorota's in Queens! Princesses don't go to Queens.
Need to marry Louis to be princess.
Hello.
I guess it's time for me to accept that if you want something badly enough, you just have to go out and get it yourself.
Hey, I was wondering what you were doing today.
Coming to stay with you, actually.
Uh okay.
Watch out, kids.
The end of me just might turn out to be the end of one of you.
The sheets you brought are on the bed, your Jo Malone candles are burning in every room, and every trace of my existence has been removed from the bathroom.
Thank you.
Just because I had to flee to the boroughs doesn't mean my creme de la mer should have to suffer, too.
I saw your photo in the paper.
Is--is everything okay? Everything is horrible.
I need to go to Louis and reassure him that he's never gonna lose me, but something is stopping me.
Chuck is stopping you.
No.
I haven't even spoken to Chuck.
You don't have to.
You two have some strange force field effect on each other.
Physicists should study it.
Fine.
Though the last thing you deserve is to hear these words-- you're right.
Chuck has finally become the person I've always wanted him to be, and I know how to change the Louis back into the prince I fell in love with, which means I'm trapped.
I have to choose, but I can't.
You have to help me.
Have you made a list of pros and cons? Sometimes that helps me.
Lists are for choosing bridesmaids, not who you're spending the rest of your life with.
You're right.
Go the Howard Hughes route.
I'm sure you'll figure it out by the time you're peeing in jars.
Fine.
Okay, I'll start with Chuck.
Pros--he truly has become a good man.
Cons--he's slept with every woman in New York.
It could get a little awkward at dinner parties.
Sometimes fun.
Don't judge.
Okay, Louis.
Pros--obviously, he's a prince.
Of Monaco.
What else? He's the father of my child.
The fact is I can make all the lists in the world, but what else matters? I've pretended like it's not a factor, but it's everything.
Isn't it? Louis is the father of my child, so he is the only ending to this fairy tale.
Right? He--he doesn't have to be.
You don't think it would matter that my baby is another man's child? It wouldn't to me.
You're--you're right.
I at least have to ask.
Uh, can you do me a favor and go grab us some food? I'm famished.
Ma'am.
This better be a long-distance call.
I told you.
I'm not leaving until I get my money.
Look, I offered you some cash to help you get back home, and you said no.
$5,000? What good is that? I gave up everything for you.
Either you give me the full amount you promised, or I will tell anyone who will listen who you really are.
Go ahead and try.
If my family didn't believe you, who will? What are you working on so intently over there? I'm going through old "Gossip Girl" blasts, trying to figure out when I started making such bad romantic decisions.
It's a trip-- which is also the name of one of my disastrous choices.
Hmm.
Not all bad, I hope.
No.
No, I'm up to, uh, junior year, and there's a lot of stuff about me and Dan, which is good.
Oh, my gosh.
Do you remember our first official date, when he took me to Jean Georges to try to impress me? I do.
Yeah, he was so nervous, I considered slipping him a tranquilizer.
We had fun.
Mm.
You know, the truth is, I don't think I ever got it right before Dan Or--or since him.
Besides Nate, he's probably the only good guy I've ever dated.
I can't disagree.
And you guys were great together.
I don't think I realized how great at the time.
Well, I think it's really something how those feelings turned into such an enduring friendship.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Of course.
Hmm.
That's weird.
A "Gossip Girl" blast.
Yeah, I've noticed you guys haven't gotten a lot of those lately.
Everyone's been afraid to send in tips since their identities were revealed.
"Since no one will dare to send in a scoop, "I had to do by own stakeout, "and my hard work paid off.
"Spotted-- "possible royal runaway bride Blair Waldorf "being offered refuge at Lonely Boy's loft.
Looks like Brooklyn fools rush in.
" Mm, I guess Dan got the ending he wanted.
Good for him.
Hello, Blair.
I need your advice.
It seems as you've found your way, I've lost mine.
I didn't think Blair Waldorf could get lost.
Neither did I, but I'm so lost, I wound up in Brooklyn.
Well, there are worse places.
This isn't something Humphrey could help you with? No.
Only you.
Do you think you could love another man's child? Why are you asking me this? I'm paralyzed.
I can't move.
I can't breathe.
You have to help me.
I can't make this decision for you, Blair.
You're the one who has to live with it.
But What's the right choice, Chuck? I can't imagine it would be a mistake to marry the father of your child.
Right? So the fake story Maureen told about the affair-- did she do that on her own, or were you involved? It was my idea.
I thought it would help Trip.
Obviously, it was a mistake.
I was planning on telling you about Maureen this weekend, but you beat me to it.
And since we're having this conversation, there's something else I was gonna tell you.
It wasn't a coincidence that Diana hired you.
She did so at my request.
Wait.
What? W-why would you do that? The whole reason I came to work here was because I didn't want to get a job through my family.
I wanted to prove myself.
And you did.
I was worried for your future, Nathaniel.
I thought you might enjoy working in journalism.
And in all honesty, I hoped I could control some of the press about Trip.
Yeah, but why--why are you coming clean now? That editorial that you published-- it made me realize you're the one who has an understanding of which direction the Van Der Bilt family needs to go in if we're gonna continue to be leaders.
Not Trip.
No.
Not anymore.
I should let you get back to work.
I know this is a lot to take in, but I hope you will still be my guest at Camp Allen this weekend.
I don't know.
I'm assuming Trip is the one who told you about Maureen.
I'm sorry he said anything before I was able to.
He's always wanted me to take him to Camp Allen.
He was pretty upset when I invited you over him.
So you never asked Trip to go? No.
Trip's scared he's gonna lose the election, and I think it's beginning to make him a little desperate.
Oh.
I'm gonna head over there, have a little talk with him.
Please, um, let me know if you change your mind about the weekend.
Nate? Uh, Max Harding, Ivy's What do you want? There's something you need to know about Charlie.
Yeah, that you accused her of being an imposter? Serena and Charlie already told me.
Let me guess.
You're here because you want me to buy your story.
It's worth it.
Yeah, well, what makes you think that I'd believe anything that you had to say? She's not who she says she is, Nate.
Hey, Serena, the loft is surrounded by paparazzi.
It's--it's insane.
Well, they're probably tracking "Gossip Girl" who's tracking Blair to your door.
Look, I know why you invited her there, and I think it's a huge mistake.
She and Louis may be having problems, but they're still engaged.
And then there's Chuck.
Dan, this is not the time to be throwing your hat into the ring.
Why do you care? Because unlike you, I have her best interests at heart.
Telling her your feelings is not gonna change your ending.
It's just gonna mess with hers.
Well, listen, the fact is, this doesn't concern you at all.
I'm gonna talk to Blair.
And even if it's the biggest kamikaze disaster of my life, it's my disaster.
It's my ending.
So--so--so please, stay out of it.
Fine.
Then I may just help someone else get their ending.
Go ahead, Serena.
They say love is blind, but jealousy, it seems, provides a clear view all the way to Monaco.
Hey! Oh, I'm sorry to bother you.
I was just leaving and I wanted to say hi.
No.
Please, come in.
You're the first friendly face I've seen all day.
That bad, huh? Yeah.
Yeah, today Yeah.
Hey, listen, I have to tell you, your, uh, ex Max came by to see me earlier.
He's trying to sell your story.
What did he say to you? Oh, he was looking for money.
He seemed pretty desperate, though.
I kicked him out, but I thought you should know.
Just be careful.
Thanks.
I will.
I'm sorry you're not gonna be able to make it to my party tonight.
Oh, well, actually, I might be able to now.
My grandfather just admitted to me that the only reason I have this job is because he bought "The Spectator.
" And here I was, thinking I was doing great work and so proud of it, and now I just feel like a total fraud.
Look, it doesn't matter how you got here, Nate.
Once you started the job, you did the work.
I read that editorial you wrote, and it's clear that you've become the leader that you wanted to be.
If you deserve to be that person, then own it and never look back.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Thank you for letting me use the suite to set up.
It's made things so much easier.
I hope we'll see you later.
As a public service, I'm staying home this evening.
I see.
Well, for what it's worth, Blair won't be attending.
Blair's schedule is of no interest to me.
Look, I don't mean to pry, Charles, but I have been worried about you as her wedding date approaches.
It can't be easy.
Thank you for your concern, but I'm fine.
It's nothing that can't be fixed with a night of scotch and perhaps a rogue socialite, if you care to send one my way.
Well, if you find that that falls short, I'm always here for you.
No matter how ugly or dark your feelings may be, you should not have to bear them alone.
I appreciate it, Lily, but you have no idea what you'd be taking on.
Are you kidding? Of course I do.
Try as you might, you don't scare me.
I'm sorry to inform you that my love for you is unconditional.
The idea of unconditional love is as quaint as the Tooth Fairy or environmentally friendly dry cleaning.
No, no, not when you're a parent.
Look, you might only be my son by marriage, Charles, but I've always loved you as my own, and I hope you get the opportunity to feel that kind of love with someone someday.
I haven't heard from her in weeks.
I'm going out of my mind.
Well, maybe I can help you.
Why? I thought after what happened at the shower, you would want me as far away from Blair as possible.
It's not for you.
It's for her.
I just want Blair to be happy and all of her dreams to come true, and I believe you're the one that can do that for her.
But you have to promise me-- no more scheming.
Of course.
I realize now how wrong I was.
I'm not looking at the gossip sites.
I'm--I'm not reading the newspapers.
I just want Blair back.
But I can't tell her this.
I don't even know where she is.
I do.
It's decided.
Chuck? No.
Apparently, there are some risks even Chuck Bass isn't willing to take.
So Problem solved.
Congratulations? I'm not crying.
You smell like onions.
Blair, what if you don't marry Louis? And what? Be alone? No.
What do you really want? To be happy.
But I don't think I know how to anymore.
Well I-I think I know how to make you happy.
I spoke with Nathaniel.
He told me about your visit.
How dare you try to undermine my relationship with my grandson? What did you expect? I'd give up everything without a fight just because you decided Nate was the future of this family? You've been the engine behind my entire career.
And that can only last for so long.
The voters are not behind you.
Yeah, and you can change that and you know it.
If you abandon me now, I'll lose the election.
I'll have nothing.
My mind's made up.
Nate called to confirm he's coming with me this weekend.
Plans have all been arranged.
Time to get on board.
Congressman? I think we can help each other.
Uh, I'm sorry.
Who are you? Someone who's sick of being pushed around by these people.
Ahem.
What are you doing here? Apparently, the same as you.
The prince and the pill popper.
This should be fun.
Shall we? No one's answering.
The man can't hold his liquor or his narcotics.
The last time he tried to crash at my place, I learned where he hid his spare key.
Sorry, boys, but didn't you know that if you wait too long to seize the day Gone.
Where would she go? The one you want can get away? There she is.
Charlie, this is Matthew Lynch.
He's covering the party for "Women's Wear Daily.
" You look fantastic.
Who are you wearing? Oh, thank you.
Badgley Mischka.
It's great.
Shall we go get ourselves a drink? Enjoy your night.
Thanks.
Thank you so much.
This party is a dream come true.
I just can't believe that you would do all of this for me.
Oh, my darling, you are family.
This is what we do for family.
Take this polyester rag off my face right now, Humphrey! And who doesn't keep a silk blindfold in their bedside table? You brought me to watch a human sacrifice, or an episode of "The Bachelor.
" Either way, I am not happy.
Would you relax? You are totally safe, and the paparazzi have no idea where you are.
We took the service elevator out of my apartment.
So I'll be right back.
No, no! You are not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on.
Would you trust me? I'm not in the habit of doing that.
Well, you don't really have a choice now, do you? Just pull around to the garage.
Evening, sir.
Welcome.
Thank you.
What the hell are you doing here? Thought I'd check out Charlie's party for myself.
Yeah? You leave her alone.
Hey, look, just 'cause you're not interested in my story doesn't mean someone else won't be.
I heard there are reporters here tonight.
A society princess exposed as a white trash fraud? Sounds pretty compelling to me.
Yeah, well, I guess I'll have to make sure no one lets you in the door.
Charlie, hey.
Nate.
I didn't think you'd be here.
Yeah, I can't stay.
But listen, I just wanna give you a heads-up.
Max is here, and he just told me he's gonna try and sell his story to one of the reporters covering your party.
Yeah, but it's all lies.
And you don't think anyone would believe him, right? Yeah, but a story a story.
I mean, true or false, it can take on a life of its own.
Really? She wasn't at Dan's? Okay, I'll find out where she is.
I promise, Louis.
Bye.
Hey, have either of you seen Blair or Dan? There's Dan.
Listen, Humphrey, I don't wanna play hide-and-seek right now.
Just tell me where the hell Blair is.
What's he doing? Looks like he's helping Chuck and Blair finally be together.
Um Would you guys excuse me? I'm gonna go have a drink.
Well, I hope the paparazzi don't know Blair's here.
They'll try to storm the Empire and ruin the whole party just trying to get a photo.
Seriously? The paparazzi could shut down the party? Especially if they knew Blair was here with Chuck.
I'll go talk to security about Max.
What's going on? Did you have something to do with this? No.
Dan arranged it for us.
What "us"? The "us" I should have fought for when you called.
The "us" that is not just you and me, but you, me, and your baby.
Then W-why did you tell me to choose Louis? I thought it was selfish if I was the one to tell you to break up your family.
That was the moment you chose not to be selfish? Well, timing has never been our strong suit.
I had it all wrong.
Just because Louis is the father of your baby does not mean you should be with him.
You should be with me.
Why? Because I'm going to love your baby as much as I love you.
What is it? "Gossip Girl" Someone sent out a blast that I'm here with you.
I don't want any photos of us to get back to Louis before I can talk to him.
I gotta get out of here.
Wait.
I wanna come with you.
Hey, sorry to bother you guys.
Just wanted to make sure you saw the "Gossip Girl" blast.
We need to leave immediately.
Yeah, I have a car here waiting for me.
So do I.
All right, perfect.
Then they'll be down in the garage.
We can go through there.
Come on.
I'd like to have everyone's attention, please.
Wow.
The paparazzi are aggressive tonight.
They must really want a shot of our new "It" girl.
I'd like to say a few words about my lovely niece Charlotte Rhodes.
Since she didn't grow up in New York City, you haven't had the opportunity to know what a wonderful young woman she is.
I hope, starting tonight, you get that chance.
Charlie? Took you long enough, and I'm not talking about the walk from the lobby to here.
Have a good trip, Nathaniel.
Camus said that life is the sum of our choices.
Choose wisely, and fortune smiles upon you.
But choose poorly? You never know what price you'll have to pay.
Hey.
Hey.
You okay? Yeah.
I'm okay adjacent.
I'm sorry I came down so hard on you before.
Eh, you were right.
I was gonna tell Blair how I felt about her.
You mean you were gonna tell her you love her? In spite of myself-- and honestly, many times-- in spite of her.
I-I mean, I didn't want to.
I kept trying to make it go away, but how do you kill a feeling? I don't know.
When you told me about the idea of rewriting the end of my story, I thought, maybe maybe that's the answer.
Then what stopped you? When I saw Blair, she'd just gotten off the phone with Chuck and she was heartbroken.
You know, I've been so consumed with my own feelings, I wouldn't let myself see how much she loves Chuck.
You were right.
She didn't need my confession.
She needed my help.
Wow, that's That's a really amazing thing to do, Dan.
Yeah, well, I mean It wasn't easy.
But I do think, uh, that I can give myself a new ending by making sure Chuck and Blair get the ending they deserve.
I want her to be happy.
Gotta head home and get started on this afterward.
Dan You're one of the good ones, you know? Thanks.
You have fun at your party? When are you gonna leave me alone? Starting now, actually.
I got some money, going back to Portland.
Good.
You think once I'm gone, you're free.
The truth is, once I go, Ivy, you are trapped in this lie forever.
Look, I worked hard to get here.
Trust me.
I couldn't be happier.
Yeah, maybe for now.
That'll wear off eventually.
No actress wants to play the same role her entire life.
This is more than just a role.
This is my life now, and these people are my family.
How can their love be real when you're a total fake? Whoa.
Are those paparazzi? Yeah.
They're chasing the car in front of us.
Pretty aggressive.
Yeah.
I think they're chasing my friends.
I have to tell Louis face-to-face that the wedding is off.
He--he deserves at least that.
Are you sure you wanna do this? I mean, a-a prince, a fairy tale wedding.
This is all you ever wanted.
No.
You're all I ever wanted.
I love you.
I love every part of you.
I-I couldn't tell Louis that he would never lose me because it wasn't true.
You're the one I never want to leave.
Okay, h-how--how do you want to do this? First, we have to go to the consulate so I can tell Louis it's off, and then I-I don't know.
We--we could go anywhere.
Switzerland has impeccable schools or maybe Tokyo? They have opening ceremony and great test scores.
Blair, Blair, we don't need to go anywhere.
We can raise this baby right here.
Look at them.
Hey, grandfather.
Yeah, well, I was a little delayed leaving the Empire, but I'm on my way to Westchester airport now.
Westchester? I thought I was taking you to the Upper East Side.
What? No.
No, no, no.
Hey.
Hey, c--let me call you back.
What? No.
I-I have a flight out of Westchester County Airport in 45 minutes.
Okay.
I just gotta get out of the park and then I can turn around.
It's not a problem.
All right.
Thank you.
Those motorcycles are really out of control.
What the hell are they doing? Oh, my God! Nate, I got your messages.
Are Chuck and Blair okay? I don't know, but I saw the whole thing.
I stayed with them until the ambulances came.
They're with the doctors now.
I spoke with the E.
M.
T.
who brought them in.
He said it's pretty bad.
Okay.
Okay.
Eleanor, Cyrus, Harold, and Roman are all flying in on the next flight from Paris.
Eleanor was distraught.
Hey.
Um Serena texted me.
Are Blair and Chuck all right? We don't know yet.
We're hoping for the best.
I'm gonna go track down the doctor and see if I can get an update.
This is all Gossip Girl's fault.
If she hadn't sent out that blast Well, I'm not trying to defend her, but it's not like Gossip Girl hopped on a motorcycle and chased Chuck and Blair through the streets of Manhattan.
Well, she may as well have.
If Gossip Girl didn't exist, Chuck and Blair would not be in the hospital right now, fighting for their lives.
You know, I spent the whole morning looking at old blasts, and it's unbelievable the amount of pain she's caused.
This is just the culmination of years of damage.
All right, so what do you want to do? Well, I wanna finish what Diana started.
I wanna take Gossip Girl down for good.
I'm with you, and I think we should use "The Spectator" to do it.
Charlie Are you okay? No.
No, I'm--I'm not.
This is all my fault.
What are you talking about? Of course it's not.
I sent the "Gossip Girl" blast.
Why? I didn't do it to hurt Blair.
I was just trying to protect myself.
From what? Max showed up tonight.
He was threatening to sell my story to the reporters covering the party.
And I thought that if I sent the blast, then the paparazzi would show up and would crash the party and it'd be shut down before Max could do any damage.
But what damage could he do? Max is a complete fraud.
Rufus, I'm sorry.
It's me.
I'm the fraud.
I just spoke to the doctor, and, um, the good news is that Blair is awake and responsive.
And Chuck? Carol, it's me, Ivy.
I gotta get out of here.
I'm leaving tonight.
This time, I'm not coming back.
We all like to think that we're in the driver's seat of our own lives.
But the truth is, the idea that we can control our fate is an illusion.
You can choose the most loyal friends, the dream job The truest love.
There's been an accident.
How bad? You know I wouldn't take a risk like this if it wasn't serious.
I had no choice.
Okay, Jack.
I'll get on the next plane.
You'll meet us there? Of course.
Thank you, Diana.
It's not me you should thank.
You were gonna tell her you love her.
I kept trying to make it go away, but how do you kill a feeling? You're one of the good ones, you know? Just because Louis is the father of your baby does not mean you should be with him.
You should be with me.
Why? 'Cause I'm going to love your baby as much as I love you.
Whoa, there's paparazzi.
Look at them.
Oh, my God! Carol, it's me, Ivy.
I'm leaving tonight.
This time I'm not coming back.
If "Gossip Girl" didn't exist, Chuck and Blair would not be in the hospital right now fighting for their lives.
I wanna take "Gossip Girl" down for good.
I think we should use the "Spectator" to do it.
Blair is awake and responsive.
And Chuck? Louie? What are you doing out here in the rain? I hadn't noticed.
I hadn't realized you and Blair had returned from Europe already.
Been back for three weeks.
I'm surprised you didn't know.
One of the downsides of not having "Gossip Girl" these last few months.
Any information would have to come from Blair speaking to me directly, which she hasn't.
She's been busy.
I'm very sorry she lost the baby.
Is she all right? Seems to be.
She spends all her hours planning the wedding.
Well, I, uh, I can't very well let you get sick before your big day.
Come on.
I'll walk you home.
I'll be fine.
Look, I know we've had our differences.
Are you really going to pass up the offer of an umbrella on a night like this? Thank you.
Shouldn't you be at some scandalous party the night before New Year's Eve? I haven't really been in a party mood.
Well, at least you've fully recovered from the accident.
Physically.
Go find Dorota.
Have her dry you off.
Thanks for letting us up while we wait for my car.
It's the least I can do after you saved me from the monsoon.
I'll go get us some towels.
Louis? Dorota's obviously become lax in announcing visitors.
There's no need to reprimand the help.
Louis invited me in.
I should have known you'd manipulate someone.
How can you blame me? You won't respond to my texts or calls.
I just wanted to be there for you after the baby.
Well, as you can see, I survived without you.
And I intend to continue that way, so you should go.
That's it? I'm just cut out of your life without any explanation? My New York wedding is in less than a month.
I have to keep my priorities in order.
We were your priority.
What happened, Blair? What changed after the accident? Did it ever occur to you that there's no such thing as an accident? Well, it certainly felt like one when the car hit the wall.
Or it was the universe's way of pointing out what's really important.
How can you say we weren't important? We were the only thing that matters.
Well, you're obviously not leaving, so I will.
Tell Louis Bergdorf's stayed open late so I can finish our registry.
I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.
I I love you, Chuck.
I love you, too, Blair.
Chuck? Are you all right? Yes.
Thank you.
Blair said to, uh, tell you she's gone to pick out China patterns.
At this hour? I'm sure it's just her excuse to avoid me.
I wish that were true.
But these excursions have become quite regular.
Well, is that why you were out in the rain--looking for her? I just wanna know what she's doing.
Have you asked Serena? Blair is not sharing anything with her.
She doesn't even let Dorota accompany her.
To be honest, I thought she might be back with you.
Well, as you can see, my presence only made her flee.
I'm thinking of hiring a detective.
I need to know the woman I'm about to marry isn't having an affair.
Well, we're both here, so who else can she possibly be cheating with? Hello, Daniel.
What are you doing here in Brooklyn? In the--in the rain at night? I was in the neighborhood checking in on my Brooklyn holdings, and I wanted to make sure you hadn't fallen into another literary slump.
Yeah, I've been holed up trying to figure out a concept for my new book, and it's great that they gave me a deal for a second one, but that means I-I actually have to come up with something to write about, so, uh I should probably get back to failing at that.
Of course.
Did you know Blair was back in town? Um no.
I mean, I-I-I live in Brooklyn.
Without "Gossip Girl," I know nothing.
I assume losing the baby made her realize she loved Louis after all.
He doesn't think so.
He thinks Blair might be having an affair.
What? No, that's insane.
How would you know? You said you hadn't seen her.
Well, I just mean that after everything Blair's been through, it doesn't make sense.
Love doesn't make sense, and neither does Blair's behavior right now.
Louis is considering hiring a private investigator.
Well, I hope you talked him out of that.
I did.
I think you'd make a much better choice.
Chuck, I'm not gonna spy on Blair.
Why? You know her well enough to know if she's hiding something.
Unless there's a reason you don't want the truth to come out.
No, that's not it.
Of course I do.
Then I look forward to a full report.
Chuck can never know the truth.
Hey, happy almost New Year.
I hope you're coming to the "Spectator" party tonight.
Well, after Nate finally forgave me for diminishing him to half a Derek in my book, I'm not gonna miss this chance to support him.
Good, then you can help me with my year in review lists.
I need "biggest transformation.
" Oh.
Um how about you? From busting Ben out of prison to being the biggest blogger in New York City, complete with cool new computer? Oh, well, you can thank "Gossip Girl" disappearing for that.
People are just desperate for information, even if it's just about me and my lack of New Year's date.
Well, I'm sure that will make all the men at the party supremely happy.
Have you seen Blair? Is she around? Uh, she's not.
Were you supposed to meet her? No.
No, I just heard she was back in town.
I wondered how she was doing.
Well, I wish I knew.
She's been keeping to herself lately.
She wouldn't even let me go with her to Vera Wang for her gown fitting.
Nate, hey, were you waiting downstairs? I'm sorry.
I'm almost ready.
Oh, good.
We just need to meet the caterer.
Hey, Dan, glad to see ya.
You know, "Inside" didn't make it into our year's best book list.
I'm sorry, dude.
Well, it's probably best to keep it in 2011.
It's a new year, new book.
What's this one about? I don't know yet, which could be why I haven't started writing it.
You should consider, um, having it set in Alaska or maybe make it a period piece? I vote for anything you don't have to write behind your friends' backs.
Listen, even if it's about Frankenstein in the Old West, I promise you full disclosure.
Sounds like a New Year's resolution to me.
Let's go.
You wanna walk out with us? Yeah, sure, I've-- I've got an errand to run.
I get it.
Alexa Chung is a better invite than your dad.
Well, have fun.
But not too much fun.
Bye.
Jenny sends her love from London.
Oh, it was so nice to have her and Eric home for Christmas.
Oh, no.
Not the sad empty nest face already.
No, it's not that.
It's just that I hoped that Charlie might surprise us with a visit, or at least a call.
She made it pretty clear that life in the Upper East Side was too much for her.
Well, I can understand, with the press at her party and the paparazzi chasing Charles and Blair.
But we were so close.
I just wish she had said good-bye.
She didn't want to upset you after the accident.
She was a wreck, Lil.
She knows what she wants.
Well, I would feel better hearing that from her.
Every time I call Carol, she says that Charlie's just run out.
You cannot blame me for not trusting my sister to tell me what's really going on.
And Carol's crazy, but she does love her daughter.
And we both agree that pushing Charlie to talk to us would be a mistake.
I know.
I just hope she's okay.
There you are.
You know how many brides I had to peek in on to find you? Yes, it is possible to lose too much weight before the wedding.
Not you, though.
You look perfect.
I can't get married in this dress.
I'm sorry.
All right, let's get you out of it, then.
It's beautiful, but Vera designed it for me before the accident, and now all I see is everything I lost.
Seriously, what is the point of making these things so tiny and complicated? It's too late anyway.
Do you know how many months of work went into this beading? A bride can't just change her mind weeks before the wedding.
Yes, she can, and she can also change her mind about marrying Louis.
Nice try, but I told you I'm committed to him, and nothing's gonna change that.
Is everything okay in here, Blair? Of course.
You are an artist.
But she needs to get married in a different dress.
I had a feeling, so I pulled some wonderful choices.
Thank you for being so understanding.
I'll go get the dresses from the back.
Now what did you burst in on my emotional moment to yell at me about? Oh, it can wait until after you find the right dress.
Hello? Remember how you asked me to call you when Blair came in for her fitting? She's here with a guy who's not the prince, and he's not a gay stylist.
Let me guess-- dark, curly hair with the pale visage of someone who doesn't get out much.
That's him.
Thank you.
We need to move this stakeout to Vera Wang.
Most surreal New York moment? The earthquake.
Or Paz de la Huerta.
What's up with your e-mail? I thought the R.
S.
V.
P.
s were going to my assistant.
Ever since "Gossip Girl" went into hiding, people have been sending their blasts to me.
Serena, there are thousands of unread messages here.
Yeah, I hoped if I ignored them long enough, people would get the point, and I guess they haven't.
I thought you wanted Gossip Girl to pay for causing Chuck and Blair's crash.
But the police didn't press charges.
What else can we do except settle for her silence? You call that silence? That's the sound of the entire Upper East Side sending you their blasts.
If you don't start posting them, they'll go back to Gossip Girl or someone worse.
My blog is about my own experience, not using information to hurt people.
Yeah, well, the least you can do is read them.
You don't think it's too simple? Why am I even asking your opinion on fashion? And why are you not responding? What stopped your never-ending soliloquy? You said I wasn't allowed to question your marrying Louis, so Oh.
Then you may resume your silence.
Blair, we are lying to all the people we care about.
Which is fine, when it's for their own good.
I'm not sure that it is.
Look, Chuck and Louis are already suspicious.
Don't you think it'd be better to tell them before they find out on their own? How would they do that? The only ones who know are you, me, and God, and God doesn't blab.
I don't know how much longer I can keep this secret.
Forever.
You promised.
I don't know if I can live with those consequences.
Look, I know our situation is far from ideal, but don't go all "Notebook" on me, not now.
I need you.
Hey, you have me.
All right? So put Weiner as worst political blunder and worst photo.
Could you see who that is, please? It's a text.
Doesn't say who from.
"I thought you were a journalist with integrity.
" Maybe Anthony Weiner has your office bugged.
Yeah.
Or someone else we did a story on isn't happy.
"Not important.
The important thing is "that the paparazzi didn't cause Blair and Chuck's accident.
I did my research.
Do yours.
" I thought I'd check in, see how your sleuthing is going.
Well, I've uncovered the fact that Blair's wedding dress, uh, fits like a glove, you know? I think the only person she's seeing covertly is Vera Wang.
Anything else to report? No, just, uh, just shopping for some wedding stuff, bossy phone calls to Dorota.
You know, that's it.
Well, if you're sure, the mission need not be continued.
Thank you for your diligent effort.
Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't find any more answers.
Louis, you were right about Blair.
We need to talk.
Hey, Louis, any luck convincing Blair to come to the party tonight? Not yet.
She's said no to every invitation since we returned to New York.
I'm afraid New Year's eve will be no different.
Louis, Serena, it's nice to see you.
Chuck, what are you doing here? I came to tell Louis he was right.
Blair is having an affair With your ex.
I'm referring to Dan, not the myriad of men since.
What are you talking about? Dan said he hasn't even seen Blair since she got back from Europe.
He lied to you, just as he lied to me.
When he said Blair was shopping for wedding trinkets, he was with her.
You followed them? After you told me not to hire a detective? You obviously have your own agenda where Blair's concerned.
Which is why I had my driver take a picture.
Just because Dan lied about seeing Blair doesn't mean that they're sleeping together.
It's a private residence.
Blair has a key.
What else are they doing there? It does explain her absences.
Yeah, but that's not proof, which is what you guys need if you're gonna gang up and accuse her of cheating, especially after everything that she's been through.
Gossip Girl probably has a treasure trove of photos in her in-box.
But they come to me now, and I'm not gonna use them to destroy people's lives.
If they're innocent, it won't destroy anyone.
He's right.
What's the harm of looking through the blasts if there's nothing to see? If that's how you wanna spend your New Year's eve, go ahead.
Knock yourselves out.
And I hope you'll focus on getting your fiancee to come to the party tonight.
She could really use a night out with people who care about her.
Hello? Andrew.
Lily just went upstairs.
Can I help you? I'm sorry.
I thought this was a personal call.
I didn't realize she'd asked you to look into something.
Yeah, I understand that your work is confidential.
I'll let her know you called.
How about "Cupcake War" as the most addictive new food show? Are those from the night of the accident? Yeah.
That anonymous texter might be right.
Can't tell from these paparazzi pictures if the photographers were even close enough to run Chuck and Blair's car into the wall.
Well, what did the police say? The front of the car was so damaged, they couldn't inspect it.
The driver passed a breathalyzer, but I'd like to talk to him myself, so why don't we invite him to the party? I am so excited for New Year's karaoke.
Will you hate me if I sing "Miss World" again? Andrew Tyler called.
I'm sorry.
I I should have told you I hired him.
I just wanted to make sure Charlie was okay.
What did he say? Nothing.
Feel good about the fact that your private detective is discreet enough to not mention his assignment, even to your husband.
Well, it's just as well that you know.
I hate when we have secrets, and this was never meant to be one.
Would you mind terribly if I called him to ask him if he found her? You obviously won't give this up.
Andrew? It's Lily.
Um, any news of Charlie? Really? Okay.
Thank you, Andrew.
She never left New York.
She's still here.
Of course I'll think about it.
Let me guess.
Louis wants you to go with him to the "Spectator" party tonight? With everything that's happened, Louis feels it's important for us to have a fresh start.
But I can't.
Well, you're about to be a princess.
Going to social events is kind of your job description.
At international galas with strangers speaking foreign languages.
I'm not sure I'm ready to deceive the people who know me best.
Oh, come on.
You're the most accomplished liar I know, except maybe Jenny, but you trained her.
This is different.
Well, maybe, but, Blair, what is a lifetime of blackmailing authority figures and casting out townies if it doesn't add up to the ability to at least feign a marginal level of happiness at an office party? You know, you banished Georgina to Belarus.
I'm sure you can down a few canapes and watch the ball drop on Nate's big screen.
Fine.
Perhaps I am just clever enough to pull off such a dissimulation.
Just make sure you continue to never utter a word of the truth.
Blair says she'll come to the party.
I've found at least a dozen photos of her and Dan.
They're obviously sneaking around together.
We both know Blair will have another explanation.
How will I determine what's really the truth? We won't confront her without her weak link.
Luckily, he'll be at the party, too.
Hey, Nate, place looks great, man.
You'd never know how much bad news passes through here.
Oh, nice to see you, too.
Did you make your resolution about not lying to your friends? I thought I did that this afternoon.
Yeah, well, our lifestyle editor says people are more likely to stick to things they put down in writing.
So since you already know yours Just twist it onto the tree when you're done.
Champagne? I think I'm going to freshen up.
I wanna look perfect for our first public appearance of 2012.
I don't know how you can argue with this.
Dan practically ran the other way when he arrived.
And still Serena has trouble believing her eyes.
I admit these do look bad, but they are friends.
Maybe they're just talking.
People don't rent secret apartments to discuss feelings, and frankly, an affair with Humphrey is the one thing that explains why she's not confiding in you and why she stopped speaking to me.
Where are you going? To ask my best friend the truth.
If Serena alerts Blair, she could make sure Dan never tells us anything either.
You have a point.
Blair has a special way of controlling men, but you know this.
And I'm sure you have an idea of how to deal with it in this case.
They'll never be able to lie about it in front of everyone.
Can I help you with something? No, thank you.
Nate said I could use his office to deal with some Monegasque business.
Happy New Year.
When Louis told me you were coming to the party, I didn't know that meant to hide in the bathroom the whole time.
I'm not hiding.
I'm primping.
They're very different.
One is done in a dark corner, the other with light-reflecting powder.
B.
, what's going on? I feel like we've barely talked since you've been back.
Wedding planning has been all-consuming.
You've had your wedding planned since you were 12.
Whatever it is, you can tell me.
I'm sorry, Blair.
But you lost the baby.
Where's Chuck? Wh-- B.
, he lost a lot of blood, and he never woke up, so it's not looking good.
Any word on a family member for that blood transfusion? Please, God.
You have my baby.
You can't take Chuck, too.
If you exist let him live.
I'll do anything.
I promise I'll keep my vow to marry Louis and never be with him again.
Blair Waldorf? Chuck Bass is asking for you.
Just because we can't be together, doesn't mean I won't love you.
That's why you cut Chuck out of your life? B.
, that nurse wasn't an angel.
I know that, but One minute he was dead, and then I made a promise, and he was alive.
That wasn't a miracle.
That was modern medicine.
Chuck is fine now.
God would understand you changed your mind.
Don't you think I've tried? I've been going to church every day.
Dan's been going with me, trying to figure out a way through this.
I went to talk to Father Smythe about it this afternoon.
Blair, it's good to see you.
And you, Dan.
Why don't we go into my office? Thank you, Father Smythe.
Having the key so I can escape at any hour is the only thing that's kept me from losing my mind.
Oh, you know, excuse me.
I gotta--I gotta take this.
What's wrong, Blair? I saw Chuck last night.
That must have been difficult.
I still love him.
I-it's not fair.
He's alive, but I feel dead inside without him.
If I broke off my engagement and begged Chuck to take me back, God would have to understand, wouldn't he? That's between you and God.
I'll give you a moment.
Blair? Are you okay? Now do you see? There's no way out of it.
If anything ever happened to Chuck, I would feel like it was my fault.
I made a vow to marry Louis, and that's what I'm gonna do.
You can't base the rest of your life on one desperate moment.
God doesn't punish people for being in love.
He wouldn't want you to marry someone you don't wanna be with.
Louis has been wonderful.
I don't not love him.
Well, then you need to come clean.
He and Chuck think you're having an affair with Dan.
What? They have photos of the two of you at a townhouse, and they're gonna out them unless you tell them the truth.
Never.
If it means keeping Chuck safe, then I'll endure the public humiliation of allegedly shtupping Humphrey.
I'll lose everything before I lose Chuck all over again.
So much for your resolution.
I thought you said you were done going behind people's backs.
My assistant stopped it before it went to the monitors.
I'm sorry, Nate.
I couldn't think of another way to get Dan to tell the truth.
Which is what? No, not the year's most secret affair.
Look I wish I could tell you, but I-I can't.
Maybe we should run the year in review presentation and have the public weigh in.
Oh, come on.
That is the last thing that Blair needs right now.
I swear to you we are not having an affair.
Then what the hell are you doing? He's having a relationship with me.
This all seems very sudden.
W-well, Blair was really trying to help keep our secret.
Yeah, with our history, we wanted to make sure that it would actually work this time before we got our friends and family involved.
And neither of us imagined you would think Dan was with Blair.
I mean, that-- That's even crazier than us being back together.
It certainly is.
Well, I'm glad you're not cheating with anyone, but, dude, you seriously need some remedial honesty training.
Yeah, I-I'm-- I really am sorry, and you, too, Louis.
Um, you and Blair have been through enough.
I should go find her.
Try the ladies' room.
Thank you.
Well, Blair told me about the deal she made, and if I can't talk her out of it, the least I can do is try to help her live with it.
Well, now that you're my date, can I get you a drink? 'Cause I, uh, I sure as hell need one.
Rufus, what are you doing here? You went out for champagne over an hour ago, and singing karaoke by myself got a little bit humiliating, so I called Andrew Tyler.
He wouldn't tell me where Charlotte was-- client confidentiality-- so I hired him to find you.
He finally broke down and told me that Charlotte Rhodes is enrolled here at Juilliard.
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to know that she's okay.
You're such a good aunt.
It's one of the reasons I love you.
Now does she know you're here? No, and I'm--I'm so torn.
I don't wanna confront her and make her feel worse than she already does, but I want her to know that whatever's going on in her life, that we still care.
It sounds like we should ring her bell and see what happens.
Let's talk to the guard.
Oh, wait.
Uh, Charlie? Sorry? Uh, um, I-I'm sorry.
I thought you were Charlotte Rhodes.
I am, yeah.
People call me "Lola.
" And you are? Looking for a different Charlotte Rhodes.
Oh, it never occurred to me that there-- there might have been two of you.
I'm sorry.
Have a happy New Year.
You, too.
Should we, um, go home and sing this off? Come on.
Ugh.
Ladies, if you'll excuse us.
I owe you an apology.
I know I promised to trust you, but I had a small lapse.
Oh, well, none of us is perfect.
We don't even need to speak of it.
I do.
I thought you were having an affair with Dan.
I'm just glad Serena told me the truth before I did something I'd regret.
Serena told you what truth? That you'd been protecting her new relationship with Dan, just like he did for us when we weren't ready for my family to know we were dating.
Of course.
Although they had much more to be ashamed of than we did.
We should let the ladies get back to business.
Blair, please.
After the accident, you told me you'd never leave me.
Now you feel further away than ever.
It's true I've been keeping a secret.
I'm converting to catholicism.
I knew how important it was for you to be married in the church.
That's wonderful.
Let's go celebrate the first year of the rest of our lives together.
Cheers! Nate? This is Greg.
He drove Chuck and Blair's car the night of the accident.
Look, I appreciate the invitation to the party, but I've already told the police everything I know.
Which is what, exactly? Those photographers got really close to the car, but the bigger problem was that my brakes felt like they had no pressure.
I swear I checked them before my shift started.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry I couldn't tell you about Serena and me, but we didn't want our families to know, and you're kind of like her brother.
So are you.
Well, I didn't do it to upset you.
Humphrey, I don't care about you or our blonde pseudo-sibling.
Your relationship with Serena may explain the sneaking around, but it does not make sense of the fact Blair cut me out of her life.
Chuck, I swear, I don't know.
I think you do.
And when I find out what secret you've been keeping and why, you will pay.
Hey, thanks for covering for me.
I know you're not keen on a Dan deja vu.
Well, it's a sacrifice that I can handle.
It's yours that I'm worried about, though.
There you are.
Serena, you better find Dan.
It's bad luck not to kiss your love at the stroke of midnight.
Well, I guess this is our cue.
Sorry, I couldn't think of a better way to save Blair.
I'll be waiting for it.
Thank you.
So the car service is tracking down all the available information.
It was Blair who ordered the car.
Now we just need to find out everyone who knew she'd be in it.
Am I interrupting? I'll see what else I can track down.
Thanks.
And I just wanted to say that you were right.
About the Dutch being the best new restaurant in town? I told you.
It was the sloppy duck, right? No, about Gossip Girl.
As much as I love the idea of a world without her, the photos of Dan and Blair made me realize it's not the secrets that cause the problems.
It's the assumptions that people make about them.
So are you saying what I think you're saying? Yeah.
I'm gonna go through all the e-mails and see if there's a positive way for me to use what's in them.
You know what that means? You're basically the new Gossip Girl.
New and improved.
Well, I'm sorry that I spoiled our New Year's celebration by stalking innocent students.
You didn't spoil anything.
You did everything you could for Charlie.
You loved her like she was your own.
But she wasn't.
Maybe it's time I trust Carol with her daughter.
Andrew Tyler found the wrong Charlotte Rhodes, and I'm gonna tell him to stop looking for the right one.
In the morning, but first we celebrate with a duet of "Endless Love.
" Happy New Year, Lil.
Happy New Year.
Blair, thank God.
Do you know what you've been putting me through? I'm sorry, Chuck.
I I-I didn't come here because I changed my mind.
Louis is downstairs waiting for me.
What the hell is going on? I just came t-to To tell you what a wonderful person you've become.
And I hope you won't let this change that.
Well, don't leave me.
I'm not doing it to hurt you.
You sat in the car and you said you'd never go.
We were going to spend the rest of our lives together, and now you can't even look at me.
Now you don't even care enough to tell me why? I saw what was important, and I made the only choice I could.
If it's not an affair with Humphrey, something else changed you.
What was it? 'Cause love does not just disappear.
We can never be together.
Please Chuck, just move on and be happy.
I can't.
Until I know why, I won't stop.
I will use all of the power I have to find out the truth.
Some things are more powerful than even you.
I'm sorry.
Don't let this destroy all the good in you.
Just because we can't be together doesn't mean I won't love you.
Just because we can't be together doesn't mean I won't love you.
I hope Chuck's gonna be okay.
Well, I'd be mad, too, if I was left with no explanation.
I promise I'll be more sensitive in our breakup.
Hey, why don't we, um, discuss our options while we raid Dorota's candy stash? We can't end our fake relationship the night it started, anyway.
All right.
Thank you for stopping by the Empire with me.
I'm glad you asked.
It seems we've finally stopped keeping secrets just in time for our wedding.
You're not getting cold feet, are you? No.
I've never been more sure of any decision my entire life.
I know my I.
D.
is in here somewhere.
Here it is.
Nate, the car service invoice just came through.
What is it? Blair got in the wrong car that night.
This says the car that crashed was the one ordered for me.
How about we help each other? X.
O.
X.
O.
Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here-- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
You were the one.
I never wanna leave.
Oh, my God! I'm sorry, but you lost the baby.
This is just the culmination of years of damage.
All right, so what do you wanna do? I wanna take Gossip Girl down for good.
I'll do anything.
Let him live.
I promise I'll keep my vow to marry Louis.
Chuck Bass is asking for you.
Blair, it's good to see you, and you, Dan.
Thank you, Father Smythe.
I swear to you, we are not having an affair.
Then what the hell are you doing? He's having a relationship with me.
Blair got in the wrong car that night.
This says the car that crashed was the one ordered for me.
X.
O.
X.
O.
Gossip Girl.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Hey, Upper East Sider, it's me, Gossip Girl.
I'm hoping you're interested in some quid pro quo, because we both have something to prove.
You look like hell.
I assume this means you didn't find anything.
I've reread every piece in "The Spectator" since I started there, and unless Christina Aguilera is mad about our "Baby Bump or Mexican Lunch?" article, I really don't think there's anything in here worth hurting me over.
Gossip Girl didn't offer to help? Yeah, but only if I help her, whatever that means.
Sometimes to get your needs met, you need to choose an unsavory partner.

  You know, that might work for you at 3
0 in the morning in the lower east side, but it's Gossip Girl.
Okay? It's been pretty nice not having her record our every move.
Maybe for you, but without her, I have no idea what Blair's up to.
You still don't know why she won't talk to you? Before the accident, she was ready to run away with me, spend the rest of our lives together, and now she won't even take my call.
I have to know why.
So what's your next move? If she won't give me my answer, I'll find it myself.
Now if you'll excuse me, Blair should be wrapping up her breakfast with Beatrice.
I have her doorman on retainer.
Be careful.
There's a fine line between surveillance and stalking.
Yeah, getting caught, which I don't plan on.
Now if you wanna catch someone, you know what to do.
I hope you don't mind the imposition.
Not at all.
With Louis at his bachelor party in Monaco, it's a comfort to have a Grimaldi by my side, and your kindness while I recuperated is very much appreciated.
I wish it wasn't something so sad that brought us together.
But now we get to focus on happier things, like your wedding next week.
How can I help? Well, you can get yourself to Vera Wang's to try on your bridesmaid dress.
Really? We all make mistakes, but I would be happy to have you stand with me next Saturday.
I feel so honored.
So hustle to Vera's, because my bachelorette party is tonight, and you need to be free at 5:00.
A real American bachelorette party? I've only seen those in movies.
Sorry to disappoint, but this won't be it-girls gone wild.
Serena has planned an elegant and intimate party.
First, dinner at Le Charlot, and then off to the Tiffany suite at St.
Regis for Kir Royales and Kiki de Montparnasse.
Even without the male strippers and a pen1s cake, I cannot wait.
Wonderful.
Now if you'll excuse me, I don't wanna be late for Father Smythe.
This fake relationship is costing me a lot of money.
I know that Blair asked us to stay together to keep Louis from getting suspicious, but I mean, coffee in Brooklyn is half the price and tastes better.
Well, haven't you learned if you want the world to think you're doing something, you have to do it on Madison Avenue? And $8 cappuccinos are the price you pay.
What time do we have to be at "The Spectator" to launch your daily column? Uh, we're actually doing it outside my office.
Nate bought cab ads, and he thought it would be fun for me to be photographed in one just as my blog launches at 10:00.
Oh, that's pretty cool.
What did you end up writing about? About how my relationships suffered under the microscope of "Gossip Girl," and--and now with her gone, how they're flourishing.
Yeah, or fake flourishing.
And wow.
Taking down Gossip Girl-- that's a pretty risky move.
Yeah, well, I wasn't sure I wanted to take her on so directly, but then Nate made a really good case, and now I can't imagine having written about anything else.
Just so you know, you're kind of the focal point of my first piece.
Well, as long as it helps your career and Blair's future, I'm on board, and the publicity from your column certainly didn't hurt.
Simon & Schuster moved up the meeting for my second book to this afternoon.
Wow.
See? A second book and my--my column launching.
Doesn't seem like fake anything to me.
Forgive me, father, for I have sinned.
I pressed the "close" button on an elevator door when I saw a woman running to catch it.
Why did you do that? It was a long ride down to the lobby, and she was wearing too much perfume.
Diddy called it "Unforgivable" for a reason.
Technically, that's not a sin, but okay.
What else, my child? My dreams at night Yes, my child? May not be about the man I'm going to marry.
Go on.
I love Louis.
I do, but I fear the devil on my shoulder.
Which devil is that? Chuck Bass, of course.
I know I need to honor my pact with God to protect him, but I'm growing weak.
I'm afraid I might break.
Father Smythe, you are the only one you can keep me on the straight and narrow.
As long as Monaco must have a royal priest, I want it to be you instead of that horrid Cavalia.
Cavalia isn't that bad, is he? While I'm loath to discredit any man of the cloth, he's the biggest snake in Christendom since the one that bit Eve.
To have you as my royal advisor will mean that you can be with me at all times.
You'll find strength in prayer.
Five "Hail Marys" and a "Glory Be.
" Thank you, father.
Today's "Spectator" is ready to be uploaded, and the photographer's downstairs to cover the debut of Serena's column.
All right.
Just give me five minutes.
I need to do something first.
Thank you.
"Spectator".
May I help you? Nathaniel.
Hey, Chuck.
Can you hear me? Why do I hear church bells? Blair was inside a church for a half an hour.
Please tell me you didn't follow her inside.
Of course not.
I didn't wanna risk blowing my cover or bursting into flames.
What's going on? Well, I just sent it to you.
Who is that? It's Charlie Rhodes' ex, Max.
The one who tried blackmailing her? Yeah, and this photo was taken the night of the accident.
Right? He's leaving the Empire with an envelope full of cash.
You think Gossip Girl knows more than she's saying? Well, it wouldn't be the first time.
I'll have security pull footage from the night of the party, see if there's something we missed.
Sounds good.
Is it true Blair plans to replace you as soon as she's princess? It is, but it doesn't matter, because she's never going to become princess.
You will see to that.
Yeah, I don't know if our plan is going to work.
Blair's bachelorette party seems like it's going to be a very staid affair.
Well, not if you're there.
And there will be liquor, no? See that she drinks a lot of it.
You're not going back on me now, are you? Beatrice, Blair is still in love with Chuck.
She just confessed it to me.
If we don't stop your brother's marriage, I will lose my position in the royal court, and you will lose me as well.
Is that really what you want? What do you want me to do? Help Louis to see the truth about Blair.
Get her drunk and alone with Chuck Bass.
Then we will show the world where her true heart lies.
Dad, Lily, what are you guys doing here? Serena asked us to come.
I'm sorry.
I was just so excited.
Of course.
It's not every day you get to see your face on a taxicab.
Serena, Lily, over here.
Oh, not yet.
We're waiting for one of the cabs.
I wonder where Nate is.
It's almost 10:00.
He would not miss this.
This is just as much his moment as it is mine.
I'm sure he'll be out in a minute.
Ah, there's one.
Taxi! This is fabulous.
He let's see that column.
I'm on it.
Here you go.
Serena, hold it up.
Yeah, right next to your face.
That's great.
Thanks.
Nice.
Smile.
Ask questions.
But there's n-- it's just blank.
Serena? Well, that's that's weird.
Maybe there's a delay or something.
What's happening? Everything okay? I hope so.
Just put that up there in the corner and make it color and see what I like.
"This page no longer exists"? I had to postpone the launch.
I'm sorry.
Well, I'm confused, because this whole column was your idea, so if you're rethinking it now, you need to let me know.
No, it's just not the right time.
Marketing said awareness was too low.
So maybe after the cabs make a few more laps around the city.
You swear that's what this is about--a marketing strategy? You'll be the first to know when I decide we're ready, I promise.
Okay.
So you think I'm ready for the pitch? 'Cause I know some of my ideas are a little on the esoteric side.
No, your-- no, your ideas are brilliant.
And obviously you light up every room that you walk into.
But I sense there's a "but" coming.
Oh you may not like what I'm gonna say.
It's a little personal.
Is it my shirt? It's my shirt, right? No.
It's Serena.
Look, you're a brilliant writer with incredible creative range, but I worry the publicity you two are getting right now is distracting people from your real talent.
See, I want Simon & Schuster to see you as the next Jennifer Egan or Chad Harbach.
And I worry that if they see you as Serena's boyfriend again They're-- They're just gonna want me to write a sequel to "Inside" again.
I'm sorry.
I--you know, I know it's not my place to say anything.
No, but I'm glad you did, because Serena's about to launch this new column, uh, and the cover story is all about us, so I need to call her and tell her not to right now.
Hold on.
Hello? Hey.
Hey.
Listen, I got a question for you.
When your column launches, do you think you could leave out, uh, the--the parts that focus on our present-day relationship? Why? What's going on? Well, my agent seems to think that I'll have a better chance of writing about something that isn't about the Upper East Side if I'm not so connected to you in the press, uh, right now.
I know--I know that sounds kinda bad.
Yeah, it did.
But don't worry about it.
My column has been put on hold indefinitely.
Oh, good.
Oh, that's great.
No, that's--that's Not good for you.
I'm sorry about that.
No, it's--it's fine.
Look, if Nate ever does decide to run it, I'll make sure all the references to you are in the past.
Yeah, we can keep up appearances for Blair's sake.
I just think maybe no more Madison Avenue.
I'm sure your wallet will be happy to hear that.
Thank you, Serena.
I really appreciate it.
Yeah.
Bye.
Thanks for keeping me company.
Told Serena I wanted to hand-pick the macarons for tonight.
Besides, I wouldn't mind an orange blossom to tide me over before dinner.
Of course.
I love Laduree.
Although I can go there anytime I like in Paris.
You can never have too many macarons.
You joke, but you might want to lick creme fraiche off a stripper or take a pole dancing class while you still can.
What's the point in deviating from the royal path, even for one night? My life is what it is.
Might as well get used to it now.
What are you doing here? And don't say shopping for velour track pants.
You're following me.
I'm not going to leave until you tell me what changed, why you turned your back on me, on us.
I told you everything there is to say.
Lurking in doorways won't help.
Sooner or later, you're going to crack.
You always do.
Whether it's at Le Charlot at 7:00 or doubles at 9:00 or the Tiffany suite at the St.
Regis at 11:00.
Maybe it's a good idea to cut loose tonight after all, far away from any place Chuck Bass can find me.
Absolutement.
Leave everything to me.
Is Nate in? Uh, he's down in graphics, but he should be back up any second.
I just wanna talk to him about my column.
I'll wait inside.
Okay, well, maybe you should Turns out Nate's gonna be longer than I thought-- Hey, wait.
What are you doing? Nate killed my column because Gossip Girl told him to.
You can't do that.
No? Watch me.
So, Dan, what are you thinking for book number two? We're all ears.
Um, you know, there are a couple worlds I'm drawn to right now.
One of them is a modern Western.
Uh, but it's like a-- like a "Henry IV" kind of structure or vibe, so there's the Falstaff thing, with all of your friends addicted to the drunken revelry of the west, you know, so it's set on a cattle range during reconstruction.
Smart, but I worry that, uh, Westerns are a little played out.
How about something more modern? Yes.
He has another idea.
It's set in Manhattan.
Keep going.
Yeah.
Um, it's basically, like, a hundred years from today.
It's the future? No, it's the near future.
Yeah, I mean, I know it's a risk Can I hit "pause"? Your fans are crying out for a sequel to "Inside," and frankly, so is your publisher.
Yeah, I mean, I don't know who's interested in hearing that story anymore.
Well, your girlfriend Serena's article about you two went up less than an hour ago, and there are already over a thousand comments.
Um yeah.
I mean, I was just-- I was really hoping to-- to stretch on this one.
Then take a yoga class.
That's good.
But, uh, write what you know.
And keep on dating Serena, at least until the next book comes out.
It's great press.
You wanted to see me? Yeah.
You're fired.
Are you kidding? You went behind my back and launched your column when I told you we weren't ready.
Oh, we weren't, or Gossip Girl wasn't? I saw her e-mail.
Look, I know that you've been secretly working for her or for her.
Either way, I don't care.
It means you're not just a liar but a hypocrite.
Did you even read the e-mail Gossip Girl sent? Which one? The last one, when she said my own cousin sabotaged my car.
Trip? You realize you're even crazier than Gossip Girl? Well, her information seems pretty reliable.
She's got photos.
Oh, yeah, because no gossip site has ever faked a photo before.
She would do anything to save her reputation right now.
Nate, what's happened to you? When did you stop being able to tell the difference between your friends and your enemies? Serena, wait.
No, you fired me.
I don't have to listen to you.
And you know what? Honestly, someone should probably tell Trip that his own cousin is trying to frame him for a crime he didn't commit.
Okay, so we shall have plenty of alcohol and many phallic party favors.
Really, the most important thing is that we steer clear of anyplace that Chuck Bass m-- Chuck Bass might find you? I understand.
We're going to have so much fun.
I even got a few party games I saw girls play on channel VH1.
Oddly it sounds perfect.
It will be a night you will never forget.
There was really no need to come up.
I told the front desk we're just fine with our Gideons.
I'm not here to sell you anything.
God's advice is free.
Father Cavalia of Monaco.
The Grimaldis' spiritual flack.
What could you possibly want with me? I received a call from princess Beatrice this morning.
She's concerned about her brother's pending marriage to Blair Waldorf.
And you think I might be the answer to her prayers? Perhaps.
I know that you're on your way to the St.
Regis to interrupt Ms.
Waldorf's bachelorette party, so I thought you would like to know that the party's been moved.
What happened to "Thou shalt not steal"? This is not the time to be cavalier, Mr.
Bass.
The woman you love is about to marry another man-- I am quite aware, and thank you for your sympathies, but tell me, father, what is your angle? This is what is known as divine intervention, monsieur Bass.
I'd accept it if I were you.
I'd have to speak with Blair in private.
I'm not sure even you could perform that miracle alone.
Who said I'm working alone? After all, I've got a higher power by my side.
Let's go.
Whoo! I have never been so happy to be surrounded by so many bridge and tunnel types.
You should have worn an actual tiara.
Are you kidding? Someone would have fist-pumped it off her head.
Ooh.
Shots now.
So who's ready for the first party game? I am.
Beatrice came up with a great plan-- match the ex with the act.
Remember how we made you write down all the secret, scandalous acts your exes committed? Well, Beatrice now holds the questions and the answers and will read each one aloud.
If no one can name the right ex We all take a shot, but if we guess correctly, you take a shot.
Well, I hope you ladies have the urge to purge, because those secrets not even Serena knows.
Wait.
Where is Serena? Oh, my God.
I forgot to call her with the change in plans.
Oh, let me call her now.
Hey, B., I'm on my way.
No, no, no, there's a change in location.
We're at Panchito's.
I'm sorry.
My phone must be messed up.
I thought you said you were at Panchito's.
Yeah, Beatrice forgot to call and tell you.
Beatrice doesn't seem like the kind of girl who forgets anything.
She's changed.
I promise.
But what are we doing even talking about this? Get in a cab immediately.
No, I'm still at the apartment.
I have to finish something, but, um, I'll be there soon.
I promise, and please don't drink too many frozen margaritas before I get there.
Bye.
Everybody's waiting.
Let's start drinking.
Hey, Trip, I'm glad you decided to come.
Well, thanks for calling.
I saw your fight with Nate on "Gossip Girl.
" I know you have no reason to take my side in anything, but I really appreciate you standing up for me in this.
I'm not doing this for you.
I'm doing it because it's the right thing.
I-I just--I don't know what Nate was thinking.
Next question--"What is Lord Marcus' favorite song?" Ooh, ooh, I know.
"Where do broken hearts go?" How did you know that? Lucky guess! There have been a lot of lucky guesses tonight.
Okay.
Question number four-- "Who once wore Blair's underwear to dinner at Picholine?" Oh, oh, oh.
Bottoms up, ladies.
No one knows the answer to that one.
I never told a single soul about that.
I don't think I even wrote it in my diary.
Carter Baizen.
Correct.
Blair drinks.
This game is kicking my ass.
Shake that.
Drink, drink, drink, drink.
No! Aah! Oh, get it! What's so funny? Serena's column.
I gotta hand it to her.
It's great.
And I'm not the only one that thinks so.
Yeah, I know.
The whole city's reading it.
Over a thousand comments.
Is that a bad thing? Well, for me, kind of.
I had my, uh, my pitch meeting this afternoon with my editor, and now that Serena and I are--are back on, he's completely focused on me writing a sequel to "Inside.
" That's great.
You guys are the new hot couple.
You should enjoy it.
But we're not dating.
We're just faking it to protect Blair's engagement.
Okay.
I'm not even gonna ask you to fill me in.
Instead, I'm just gonna assume there's a long royal explanation.
You know me well, and Blair, but the point is as long as it seems like Serena and I are together, my editor's not gonna let me write a second novel I'd actually care about.
Well, sacrificing your career for the people you love, I understand.
But sacrificing it for fake love, I I think it's counterintuitive.
Yeah, which is why I have to find Serena.
Have you seen her? Tonight's Blair's bachelorette party.
I'm sure she's there.
Well, I've already crashed her bridal shower.
I'm sure it won't matter if I barge in on another pre-wedding event.
Oh, tell Serena I'm a fan.
Now since I'm not sober I'm gonna tell you what I really think about tonight.
I'm having the best time.
Ohh, I'm so glad.
But I had my doubts about you.
You are almost as scheme-y as me.
But we are cut from the same cloth-- overbearing mother, absent father, the weight of a thousand expectations.
You're right.
I always am.
Can I ask you a question? Anything.
Why are you marrying my brother when I know you're not in love with him? I do love him.
There might be some loves that seem bigger than others or more complicated or harder to let go of.
But there's a reason they're not meant to be.
You cannot choose who you love.
But you can choose how you love them.
And there are some people you can only love by not being with them.
Okay, I'll get you some water.
You need to sober up.
Oh, you're so nice and so pretty.
I don't understand.
How could Nate ever believe I'd wanna hurt him? He's the closest thing I have to a brother.
No, I know, but you know, Nate's not the kid that you grew up with.
He's changed.
Yeah.
Well, so have I.
And I'm not gonna sit here and let him try to frame me for a crime I didn't commit.
Well, then we need to kill the story before he goes public with it.
How? There's no way I can prove I didn't do it.
I know, but maybe we can find out who really did do it.
I mean, come on.
Is there anyone that you can think of that would wanna hurt Nate? I don't even wanna say this out loud, Serena.
But all the way here, I was replaying it in my mind.
Replaying what? The night of the accident.
I heard Maureen call a car to take her to the Empire.
If I had known-- Wait, wait.
Maureen? Are you surprised? I mean, after all, all she's ever cared about was my career, how my success reflected on her.
When she saw grandfather pass me over for Nate, she decided to protect the thing that mattered to her most.
I think we've heard enough.
Thank you, Nate.
Oh, don't thank me.
Thank Serena.
It was her idea.
What the hell's going on? Well, we knew you wouldn't admit to anything, so Serena and I staged that little argument on "Gossip Girl.
" We figured you'd try to pin the accident on someone else just like you did two years ago when you left Serena in that car.
Did you really think I'd talk to you again, never mind take your side against Nate's? You're really gonna try to pin this on Maureen? Oh, I'm not pinning anything.
It was Maureen.
Why don't we go ask her ourselves? We don't have to.
She has an airtight alibi.
How do you know? Because on the night of the accident, she was with me, consulting with a divorce lawyer.
And as soon as she hears about this, she's definitely gonna be through with you.
I have to say, an unexpected choice.
I'll get Blair.
Why don't you wait in the car? I certainly hope you know what you're doing.
A priest in a bar? Kinky.
You have no idea.
Let's go this way.
Now tell Beatrice I need air.
I'll be back in a minute.
Whoo.
Whew.
Hey, bridey, got a match? Two.
And that's the problem.
All right, well, hold this while I go find one.
Ooh.
Don't mind if I do.
Ooh, the strippers are here! Ooh.
Whoo, whoo! Excuse me, miss.
Is that a joint in your mouth? Well, hello, officer Weiner.
Why, yes, it is.
Do you want some? Okay.
Oh, you're no fun.
Where did Beatrice find you? No, shh.
Just cut all small talk.
Let's find out if you really are New York's finest-- Oh! Is that a real gun? Okay.
Ow! What are you doing? Is this part of the act? Hey, excuse me, officers, we-- Back off, kid.
Okay.
No.
No, no, no.
D-don't you know who I am? I'm going to be the princess of Monaco! Yeah? And I'm the king of the 6th precinct.
I love you, New York! Of course you'd be behind this.
Hey, where's Blair? I'm just finishing the paperwork.
You royal bitch! You paid that girl to give me a joint and tipped off the police that I was outside with it because you wanted to humiliate me in the eyes of the world.
What's next? Photoshopped nude pics? A dead body in my bed? Ooh, hey, she's-- she's just making a point.
Blair, this was not Beatrice's fault.
It was Chuck's.
Chuck's? I shook his tail with a decoy plan.
He's staking out a suite at the St.
Regis as we speak.
No, I saw him there with my own eyes.
Ma belle-soeur, may we speak privately? Go ahead.
I'll wait for your things.
How you doing? Start at the beginning.
And don't leave anything out.
The day of the accident, I met Max.
He followed you from Nate's office and offered to help me in exchange for money.
We'd just had that argument about the weekend, Nate taking my place.
I was so angry, and so I paid him to drain the brake fluid from the car-- Half before and the rest when it was done.
So that explains Gossip Girl's photo of Max at the Empire.
I met him outside the garage to give him the rest of the money.
He said he'd done it, and he took off, but when I double-checked, it turns out that he played me.
He took the money, and he ran.
So you did it yourself.
Look, I never meant for anything to happen to Blair.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have cared if I ended up in a wheelchair or worse? I never thought it would get that bad.
I thought you'd--I don't know-- hit a parked car, get thrown around, get banged up.
I wanted to ruin your weekend, not your life.
And I know what you think of me after what I did to Serena.
But when I saw you rising up at "The Spectator" Well, we both know there's only a certain amount of grandfather's love to go around.
He chose you.
And so I did the only thing I knew how to.
That's it? That's your answer? What, not enough love? I raised you to stand on your own two feet.
No.
You raised me to kneel before yours.
And now my life is over.
And that's exactly what you deserve.
Two years ago, you and I were the ones in the accident, and you left me hurt and alone, and you got off scot-free.
But that's not what's gonna happen this time.
This time, you are gonna pay for what you did.
And I'm gonna see to it.
Oh, Blair's been arrested.
Go.
We've got it covered.
So you're telling me that when my face is on "Page Six" tomorrow, I have nobody to blame but myself? Yes, but don't be so sure about the story getting out.
Where did you get those? I bought them off everyone outside the bar.
Did you get all of them? If anyone talks, it'll be just a rumor.
No proof.
Oh, I've never been so happy for the demise of "Gossip Girl.
" But now one last thing.
Oh.
Voila.
Trip's in the car.
Says he wants to tell the police himself.
I'm gonna take him down there now.
Good.
I wanna thank you, Nathaniel, for the way you handled things tonight, and for never believing that I could have had anything to do with this heinous crime.
Well, I'm glad your conscience is clear.
Wh-what is that supposed to mean? You can't possibly blame me for what happened.
You've pitted us against each other our entire lives.
Everything is a competition, and the prize is your approval.
It's the great Van Der Bilt tradition.
Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way about your own family.
And might I remind you that Diana Payne would never have given you that job at "The Spectator" if I hadn't paid her to? You really think you can make it on your own? I don't know.
But it's the only way it'll mean anything.
I've set up some meetings with investors.
I'll be making you an offer.
Hey, where is she? What happened? Oh, she's fine.
They're not pressing charges.
Oh, thank God.
You would not believe what I just came from.
Look, Serena, while we're alone, there's something I need to say to you.
Are you fake-breaking up with me? You know how guys say, "It's not you.
It's me"? Well, in this case, it's--it's my book.
Well, don't worry.
You haven't hurt my fake feelings.
I would never wanna get in the way of your career.
There you are! Ohh! Is everything okay? Were you worried about little ol' me? B.
, you smell like a distillery.
I had shots.
They were fun! The first ten, anyway.
Oh, well, I'm sorry I missed the excitement.
Oh, I had someone to watch over me.
I'm sorry.
She's so nice.
Where's Blair? With me.
Can you get her to Chuck's hotel? No.
The plan is finished.
It's over.
And so are we.
Beatrice, wait.
I don't want to play these games to hurt people.
I only want you, but you're never going to leave the church for me.
We both know it.
I'm just the only one brave enough to say it out loud.
Hey.
Hey.
I wanted you to know Blair made it home safely.
I just tucked her in, and she is out like a light.
No surprise there.
I never thought I'd see the day when Blair Waldorf ate a tequila worm.
Yeah, I never thought I would read something written by Serena Van Der Woodsen that made me laugh out loud, and even more pressi-- There were no witnesses, so I will deny it if asked publicly, but, uh, there may have been a lump in my throat.
Really? A lump? Don't gloat, but seriously, I mean, it's-- it's surprisingly real for something supposedly fake.
Well, not all fake.
No, I know.
We--we dated for years, so of course there's history there.
Yeah.
But But what? It I don't just Whatever.
Have a good night, okay? No, what is it? Tell me.
We're Dan and Serena.
You can tell me anything.
It must be true, 'cause I read that online.
I-I have to go.
Bye.
Chuck, you need to leave now.
I don't know what it is you think I did tonight, but all I care about is her.
Blair's asleep, okay? And even if she wasn't, she-- she wouldn't wanna see you anyway.
Tell her I came by And that I'm not done.
That's one thing I learned from Blair.
You don't give up on the people you love.
Rise and shine, jailbird.
I made you French press.
Oh, no, no, please, please.
I beg you, no light.
Here.
You want your coffee? Uh, stop spinning.
What are those? Louis' wedding vows.
I found them hidden in my desk last night, and I was drunk enough to allow myself a minor ethical transgression.
Blair! Okay, how were they? It's like he peered into my soul.
I know Louis loves me, but sometimes I wonder if he understands me.
But reading this is exactly what I needed to go into our wedding sure of my choice.
Mm.
Can I be a little jealous? You may.
I-I can't wait for you to hear them on Saturday, and you don't have to keep up the charade with Humphrey for me any longer.
Louis and I are in a good place now.
Yeah, well, I'm glad everything worked out like it should have.
I'm gonna go into the office now, take down my column.
It'll help Dan.
You ready? Ready for what? No! Miss me, Upper East Siders? Have you been asking yourselves if you're better off now than you were two months ago? You've made a grave mistake, Beatrice.
You forget I still have your mother's ear.
And she had no trouble believing you were still trying to ruin your brother's wedding.
So when I suggested you might benefit from some missionary work in East Africa, she agreed.
I'll tell my mother we slept together.
You'll be defrocked.
And whose word do you think she'll accept? Her scheming daughter or her loyal, loving priest? You might be able to get rid of me, but you won't be able to stop the wedding.
Which is why I have found someone far better equipped to assist me in my cause.
That's probably your mother now.
Bon voyage.
Hey.
Hey, can you meet for lunch? Well, I'm kind of on a roll here.
What's up? Uh, well, I actually talked to Blair this morning, and she wants us to stay together until the wedding, just so Louis doesn't suspect anything.
Would you hate that? Uh I mean, no.
No, that's fine, but only until the wedding, right? Yeah.
Yeah, no, of course.
You know, um, but we should probably still go out to keep appearances up.
Uh, sure.
Coffee? I don't know.
I was thinking, you know, dinner could be better or--or maybe a movie? Yeah, that's fine by me.
I'll call you later.
Trapped under the weight of a false accusation, I've done a lot of thinking about the kind of girl I want to be from now on.
I'd like to be the kind Who does what she says she's going to do.
Thank you.
Mr.
Bass, welcome.
Right on time.
I have no interest in niceties.
Just tell me what you know.
I know what is in Blair Waldorf's heart, and if you don't want this wedding to happen, together, we can make sure it doesn't.
She already thinks I'm a villain.
I may as well become one.
You know what they say-- talk is cheap.
So if you don't have anything nice to say, maybe you should just shut your mouth.
X.
O.
X.
O.
Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here-- Your own and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Don't have to keep up the charade with Humphrey for me any longer.
Louis and I are in a good place now.
She wants us to stay together until the wedding so Louis doesn't suspect anything.
You're the one.
I never wanna leave.
Oh, my God! Let him live.
I promise I'll keep my vow to marry Louis.
You can't base the rest of your life on one desperate moment.
I'm just cut out of your life without any explanation? My new wedding date is in less than a month.
I have to keep my priorities in order.
We were your priority.
What happened, Blair? My dreams at night may not be about the man I'm going to marry.
I'm growing weak.
I'm afraid I might break.
I know what is in Blair Waldorf's heart, and if you don't want this wedding to happen, together we can make sure it doesn't.
Wakey-wakey Upper-East-Siders, Gossip Girl here.
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
It seems like today is a big day for everyone, but none so much as me.
Miss Serena, it's finally here.
Can you believe? So exciting.
I smile and cry at same time all morning, and not even wedding yet.
Where's Blair? She went to final fitting.
Everyone else is coming here-- including Mr.
Lonely Boy-- for breakfast buffet.
Get dressed and eat something.
You need strength today.
Once upon a time, Princess B.
was a virgin queen, and her king was named Archibald.
Who would've thought in just five short years, she could turn that headband into a tiara for real? I myself have come a long way, too.
But if you think I've spent all my recent downtime reflecting on who I am and what I've done in those same five years, let me assure you, that couldn't be further from the truth.
I was just planning my comeback.
So if I were you, I'd watch this space, because the new Gossip Girl is coming.
And what will my first post be? All I can say is you should probably pray I won't be writing about you.
You'd think I wouldn't still have to do this sort of thing, but labels don't even have interns anymore.
I'm heading down to the East Village before the wedding to put some of these up.
Oh, those are, uh, good luck, by the way.
I wore them at my wedding.
I'm not sure what I'd need luck for, as I'm not the one getting married, but thank you.
Well, you're in the wedding party.
That's close enough.
What-- Why are you in the wedding party again? I did a favor for Louis last week, so he asked me.
I figured it's better than sitting alone in a pew, right? Oh, so no date tonight, or does the charade continue? Once Blair and Louis say "I do," then Serena and I can say "we don't" anymore and go back to being just friends.
No, but at the very least, this whole thing is probably a distraction from any "Graduate" thoughts you might have.
Well, with Blair? No, any--any thoughts of her running off with me are-- are long gone.
If anyone's in danger of pulling a Braddock, it's not me.
It's Oh, I'm sorry, Father.
I don't play those sort of games anymore.
You'll need this to get past security today at the church.
Shall we go over the plan again? Please.
Father Smythe's afternoon tea will be supplemented with sleeping pills instead of his usual sweetener.
When he is unable to perform the ceremony, her serene highness will have no choice but to ask me to step in.
During the service when I ask if anyone has any objections, that's where you come in.
And tell the world that only last week, I'd overheard her tell you she's still in love with me.
Voila.
In one fell swoop, you'll have saved Blair from a loveless future, and I will have saved Monaco from a thankless princess.
It is, as you people say, a win/win.
Are you prepared? More than you know.
Water? Merci.
Oh, Serena.
I am so nervous.
Can you believe it? She's marrying me.
I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Don't worry, Miss Serena.
You find someone who loves you that way, too.
Thank you for indulging on this one more time.
I just wanna make sure I know all the steps.
Is everything okay? You look Surprised that we made it to this day? I am.
I was certain that your bride-to-be would humiliate our family in some way.
Well You don't have to worry anymore, because the brand-new positive image of the Monegasque Royal Family is intact.
And Blair is transformed into the most advantageous partner.
The press took to her in the wake of the unfortunate incident.
I couldn't have hoped for a more perfect arrangement.
I can't believe you're talking this way on the day of my wedding.
My relationship with Blair is not a business deal.
But all relationships are business.
Sometimes you are lucky, you have love as a bonus.
Let us hope that you stay lucky.
I can't stop the feeing that I've forgotten something.
I've been over everything: The photographer, the caterer, the programs, all fine.
I just cannot put my finger on it.
Well, I'm sure it's all right.
I mean, you never forget anything.
It's one of your best, uh, and worst qualities.
As you know, the mother and father of the bride will share a dance this evening.
Oh, well, the father of the bride is right over there.
Oh.
Well, we're set then? It's been a long time since we've danced.
I'm game if you are, as long as you don't show me up like you did the last time.
Serena, uh, Louis' best man's flight has been delayed from Rome.
Would you like to just choose another partner from the present groomsmen just in case, or shall I just appoint one for you? I've got this one covered.
Dan Humphrey, my hero.
Wonderful.
Thank you.
Wow, the Dan I knew five years ago could barely box step, and now you're volunteering to dance? Well, I've gotten much better.
I had to, after I met you.
You wouldn't have kept a partner with two left feet around for very long.
Well, I liked your left feet.
Well, don't worry.
Once I put my dress shoes on, I'm sure I'll still step all over you.

  Hey, she's here
The princess bride.
Oh, you're back early.
Well, there are several matters to attend to.
Uh, first off, CNN is asking if you privately wish to be called "princess" or "Mrs.
Grimaldi.
" I'm sorry.
I just, uh, need my best friend for a moment.
Go right ahead, Mrs.
Grimaldi.
"Mrs.
Grimaldi"? What is going on? Is this happening? Well, it better be.
Otherwise, all those commemorative plates are for nothing.
Oh, God.
I'm gonna be married.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be more than okay.
It's gonna be the best day of your life.
Are you sure nothing's gonna ruin it? Of course not.
What could? "A True American Princess"? "The Next Diana"? Don't these people do their research anymore? Maybe they just don't know her like you do.
Or they've conveniently forgotten.
Well, I haven't.
That bitch got me remanded to rehab, banished from Bible camp, and abandoned in Belarus, all for her own enjoyment.
If this is supposed to be her happiest day, then I can't wait to rain all over her parade.
I know you're capable of many things, but how do you expect to get into the wedding of the century? By joining forces with the century's biggest wedding crasher.
I thought you were getting changed.
I did.
But the surplice? Ohh! Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I feel sick.
May I use your restroom? No, you may not, but you better find one you can and stay close to it for the rest of the day.
You may have a touch of food poisoning.
What did you do? Well, I'm just guessing But it's possible the water I've been continuously pouring for you all morning came from the tap at a Bass Resort bathroom in Mexico.
You see, I can't allow you to destroy Blair's wedding.
You think because I love her, I want her all to myself, but I'm not that man anymore.
I just want her to be happy.
And if marrying Louis will do that for her, then that's what's going to happen.
I hope you can find a public restroom soon-- one where the line isn't too long.
Shh! Bless us, Father.
I have a feeling we're about to sin.
These black market babies got me through my morning sickness.
Just don't take them with vodka.
Learned the hard way.
Thank you.
Now who are you again? The answer to your prayers.
From what I overheard, we both wanna take out the same wedding, which makes us kindred spirits, and now that you're down for the count, I'm more than happy to pick up where you left off.
And why should I trust you? Because clearly you need an expert.
You were trying to go after Blair.
She's not the weak link.
It's always the man.
And if you hand me that costume you're holding, I'll prove it to you.
How can you be so sure you can pull this off? Jesus owes me one.
Isn't the, uh, reception at the St.
Regis? Yeah, I'm clearing the rehearsal breakfast.
Isn't the wedding hours away? Yeah.
I'm waiting on a friend.
He's inside.
He's a groomsman.
I'm, uh-- Nate Archibald.
Yeah.
I worked your office Christmas party, remember? Ow.
Wow, we must have just missed each other.
The place was so crowded in there, you know? You signed my invoice at the end of the night.
Well, I was really drunk by the end of the night.
And the day before, when we met to create the inventory list.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I meet a lot of people-- It's okay.
You know, I can't really expect someone like you to remember someone like me, right? If you'll excuse me Who was that? Someone I should have remembered.
Maybe that's my issue-- Paying too much attention to the wrong girls and not enough to the right ones.
Well, if we're listing your issues, I'm not sure I'd start with that one.
I mean, here I am, solo at the wedding of the girl I spent half my life assuming I'd marry, and why? Because yet another one of my relationships turned out to be based on lies.
Well, they haven't all been like that.
Maybe I should just admit that there's no such thing as an honest relationship and stop looking.
Now that's crazy.
Of course there is.
Hey, you know the world is really a mess when the most honest person we know is Chuck Bass.
How'd that happen? Well, however it happened, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
We have to make sure that today is the one day - he's not planning on honesty.
Hey, I was thinking the same thing.
In just three hours, everything is going to change.
Well, not that much.
I mean, you were already royalty, even if you titled yourself, and your kingdom was the steps to a museum, but now you have an entire country to rule because you're gonna be a real life princess.
How does it feel to have everything you ever wanted? You tell me.
I saw you with Humphrey this morning.
So that fake connection sparked a real one? Not exactly.
Serena Van Der Woodsen, you didn't tell him I said you could stop pretending? I just thought, what's the harm in waiting till the wedding? The harm is that you are falling further while he has little to no clue.
No one is falling anywhere.
I saw how you were looking at him this morning.
Back in high school, he always had the same look in his eyes whenever you would walk by, like he was starving, and you were a tasting menu.
Oh, please.
Just tell him already, before you mess everything up like you did last year when you pretended there was a choice to be made.
When even Gossip Girl knew there wasn't.
Don't let the fear of how he's going to respond hold you back.
At the very least, say it loud and be done with it.
May we come in? - Yes.
Oh.
I know I said once that you would never be as pretty as when you're young But you get prettier every day.
Oh, sweetie.
What is it? What's-- What's wrong? I don't know why I'm being like this.
It is just nerves.
Yeah.
No, I-I-I I can't breathe.
This dress is cutting off my circulation.
Maybe I should just take it off for a minute.
Yes, I'll take it off for a minute.
Everything will be okay.
Get it off! No, no, sweetie.
You just need to breathe.
You just need to breathe and-- and have a drink of water and get some air.
I'll get the water.
I'll open a window.
It's going to be fine.
Come here.
You look so beautiful.
She is a nervous wreck.
Well, come on.
What bride isn't on her wedding day? - I wasn't.
Yes, you were.
The quartet had to stall for 20 minutes until her Xanax kicked in.
I have to run a last minute errand.
Could you keep Blair comfortable and calm until I get back? - Of course.
Sure.
Thanks, sweetie.
Are you coming? No, you're her father.
You should go.
Milo? With the nanny like you asked.
Good.
Then let's get cracking.
Nathaniel.
Didn't see you this morning.
I slept in.
Right.
Well, uh You have any plans today? Why don't we do you a favor and skip your ellipses? Monkey and I have a lovely day planned far from the Upper East Side.
The only person you have to worry about stopping Blair's wedding is most likely standing right next to you.
Hello, Humphrey.
Chuck.
Hey, man, I'm sorry.
I just thought I'd, uh, you know I know what you thought, and you don't need to anymore.
If I'd been meant to stop the wedding, there would have been some sort of sign.
I have to go.
Mrs.
Waldorf, what are you-- - Am I doing here? I've been asking myself the same question the whole ride over.
Can I have something to drink? Of course.
Sparkling or still? Scotch.
Ahh.
It's my daughter's wedding day.
Everything should be perfect.
Hell, everything is, but that doesn't mean it's right.
When I married Harold, I was so nervous.
I knew something was wrong, but I didn't know what.
But when I married Cyrus, I was very calm.
It was like everything was falling into place.
I don't want my daughter to have to wait for a second chance to be happy.
She should be happy the first time around.
Wh-what are you saying? All day long, I've had this feeling that I had forgotten something, and then I realized what it was.
You.
So are you coming to stop this thing or at? Oh, look at that hat.
Look at all of it-- The flowers, the press, the people, the sheer enormity of it.
We must not really be married if this is what a wedding is supposed to be like.
Of course we're married.
Remember the park? Darling Scott, Sonic Youth? Georgina? Oh, yes, and that.
I'm trying to forget that part.
Oh, let's find our seats.
Why'd you need this? What's the point of doing something scandalous if you don't record it? There's gonna be a scandal? After I seduce Prince Louis and Blair catches us, there will be.
Even if she knows I set this all up just to mess with her, once we upload that video to "Gossip Girl," she'll have to postpone the wedding just to save face And that weird priest will take over from there.
Th-there he is.
Get behind that screen and hit "record.
" Come in.
Oh.
Hello.
Uh, would you please tell the groom that, um His sister Beatrice is waiting in his chambers to see him.
Oh, and in ten minutes, tell the bride the same thing.
Make that five.
I had it changed so you and Serena can walk down the aisle together.
Much more romantic.
Oh, right.
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
You don't have to keep pretending.
Blair told me everything.
Wh-- what, she did? Yes, and I'm delighted your feelings have become real.
Okay, anyway, uh, thank you both from the bottom of my heart for covering for Blair's conversion lessons.
You really are her best friends, which makes you mine, too.
Excuse me.
Um, apparently, my sister made a surprise reappearance.
Sure.
Prince Louis, I had to see you.
Oh, I bet you did.
When Rufus said he thought he saw you, I knew it must be true.
Crashing one wedding wasn't enough for you? - I didn't crash.
I was invited.
My invitation just got lost in the mail.
I do live in Brooklyn now, after all.
I mean, it's practically the Falklands.
Well, it's time for you to go.
We've already alerted security, and I am glad I'm the one to throw you out myself.
Now get your clothes on.
We'll be waiting just outside.
I'm sorry, babe.
Oh, we are so not done.
I'll think of something.
How? They're on the other side of that door.
That one, yes, but not that one.
You should, like, totally donate that dress to the Smithsonian.
Out.
Out, everybody, out, out.
Mother, where have you been? Everyone's been looking for you.
Don't be angry with me.
Angry with you? I'll just leave the two of you alone.
What are you doing here? Trust me, the last thing I wanted to do was show up today, but even your own mother seems to think we need to talk.
Well, what I need is for you to-- - Don't marry him.
Chuck.
Don't marry him.
All those people out there are waiting for me.
Yes, they are, but they also want you to be happy, which you're not going to be if you go through with this.
Tell me I'm wrong, and I'll leave.
You can't, because it should be us up there, and you know it.
It isn't that simple.
It's only that simple.
You told me you loved me.
I know it was true.
It is.
Of course I love you, Chuck.
I've always loved you.
I love you more and more every day, if it's even possible to love someone that much.
Then get out of here with me right now.
We can go anywhere, just as long as we're together.
I know you can't understand, and I don't expect you to.
But even if I weren't with Louis I couldn't be with you.
Just know that not living with you is the hardest thing I've ever done, but at least I have someone who loves me by my side.
You should find someone who loves you, too.
I have.
She's standing right in front of me.
I know it sounds crazy, but I really am doing this for you.
Hey, B., the photographer's ready.
It's okay, S.
Chuck was just coming to give me his blessing.
Right? Come on.
That was so touching, really.
If I ever cried, I'd be moved to tears.
The best part is, I got it all for posterity.
Now I can't help but wonder what would Louis think if he heard how Blair felt about you? Oh, good.
We found you.
Don't worry.
I was just leaving.
I just needed to leave my gift first.
Bye.
What is going on? It's time.
B.
, are you sure you feel right about all this? Because I am totally prepared to make a run for it with you if that's what you want.
I've made peace with my decision, and so should everyone else.
Okay, if that's how you really feel.
It is.
I know you think you can't be with Chuck because of the pact you made with God, but maybe the pact is just an excuse you're using to protect yourself from-- from the messiness and uncertainty of a life with the man you really love.
I'll grow into loving Louis.
I'm sure of it.
And he'll never hurt me.
He won't have to.
You're hurting yourself enough by marrying him.
B.
, no matter what's happened between you and Chuck, the two of you have always been connected.
Everything that you've gone through keeps leading you back to each other, just like it does Dan and me, and I know that it scares you and I know that it's a risk, but don't enter into a false life just because you're afraid to face your real one.
I am--I'm so sorry.
I don't know what I was thinking.
No, it's okay.
I understand why you brought Chuck.
But despite everyone's protestations, I'm going through with this.
Serena Will you please tell everyone I'm ready to begin? Chuck, wait.
Don't worry.
I'm leaving.
No, that's not what I was gonna say.
You need to know something-- something that if Blair knew I was telling you, she'd probably never speak to me again.
Listen, I don't want to alarm anyone, - but there's been an emergency.
What? - Yeah.
Blair needs you right away.
Of course.
I'm all hers.
Come this way, please.
Oh, sure.
Right this way.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Blair, my little turtle dove, what's the emergency? I need another escort.
What? Did something happen? Are you hurt? No, no.
In fact, I feel perfect.
Well, what's going on? You have an escort, Blair-- your father.
Oh, Cyrus.
One father is not enough.
I need both of you to walk me down the aisle.
Ohh.
All right.
All right.
Beautiful.
Since we have a moment alone, would you mind telling me why everyone seems to think we aren't fake dating except me? I think I may have just done something really bad.
What'd you do? She's beautiful.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered in the sight of God and in the face of this congregation to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is commended in holy writ to be honorable among all men.
If any man can show any just cause why these two may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter forever hold his peace.
If no one else is going to say it, I guess I have to.
The person who should be objecting isn't Chuck bass but the bride herself.
Don't believe me? Watch this.
Of course I love you, Chuck.
I've always loved you.
I love you more and more every day if it's even possible to love someone that much.
Told you my first post was worth waiting for.
Now what will my next one be? I can't believe you did this.
Good, because I didn't do it.
You really expect me to buy that? It doesn't matter anymore.
Gossip Girl just showed everyone the truth.
It's all out.
The only part she didn't tell is this crazy idea that if you and I got together, something terrible would happen to me.
That's right.
Serena told me about the pact.
She, like me, cares about you and your future.
It's not my future I'm worried about.
Blair, you can't honestly believe-- What?! Can't honestly believe that you were dead? Because you were, and you weren't coming back.
The only thing I knew I could do in that moment was to find a way to try and save your life, whatever it took.
Even though I knew that once I did, you would never stop trying to ruin mine.
So The truth is out.
But that doesn't mean I'm going anywhere with you.
Louis What happened out there is awful.
But the part you didn't hear was that I chose you.
And I know this is humiliating, but if you wanna stay with me and go through with this, then I promise I will never humiliate you again.
Excuse me, Your Highness.
Your mother's requesting a word.
Georgina.
Oh.
You caught me.
I'm so scared.
What'd you do? I didn't do anything.
Oh, you expect us to believe you're just an innocent bystander? I never said I was innocent.
I just like to watch.
And while I love our annual showdowns as much as anybody, if you're looking for someone to blame for what just happened, you've got the wrong girl.
Come on, Georgina.
Sure, I made the video Gossip Girl played, but I didn't send it in.
I left my camera with Chuck, thinking he'd show the prince, and they'd have a duel at dawn for what's left of Blair's virtue, or maybe it's royal fisticuffs, whatever those are.
Chuck was in the back of the church.
If he wanted to say something, he had his chance.
It's not like him to hide behind Gossip Girl.
No, it isn't, is it? Maybe you should ask yourselves which one of you had the most to gain from sending that video in.
I know from experience it's never who you'd think, so that rules out Chuck.
Maybe it was you, wanting to help his best friend get his girl back.
Or maybe it was you, wanting to make sure your best friend didn't make a huge mistake.
Or better still, how about you? Sending in that video would ruin both the wedding in Chuck and Blair's eyes, which is exactly what you want, since anybody with a pulse can see you're madly in love with her.
Oh, except for you.
Anyway, whoever it was, the wedding's over now.
See you at the next shindig.
Ta-ta.
Serena, Dan, we need you right away.
I am sorry for the outburst.
It won't happen again.
Now if we can continue This time, after where you left off.
Where you been all night, huh? Oh, royal groomsmen duties are vast.
Who knew? Did you talk to Chuck? No, I haven't even called.
I can't believe he did that.
I mean, after everything that happened last year, you would have thought he changed, - but I guess he hasn't.
Yeah.
Hey.
What are you guys talking about? Oh, you know, just how love makes people do crazy things.
However poorly timed and inappropriate, what Chuck did was a grand gesture.
Maybe if I'd done one of those for the people I've cared about in my life, I wouldn't be at this wedding alone.
Excuse me for a second.
About before Oh, you mean what Georgina said? No, forget that.
She's-- She's crazy.
No, no, I owe you an explanation.
Oh.
All right, go ahead.
I'm sorry I lied and-- and made you carry on our-- whatever it was-- longer than we had to.
You're sorry? Is that it? I mean, how about why you did it? Was it for publicity for your column, or did you just want, like, a date to your best friend's wedding? I can't figure it out.
That's because I haven't been honest with you.
And Nate was right about grand gestures.
We all need to make them in our lives, so here's mine.
I love you, Dan Humphrey.
Always have, always will.
Serena No, you don't have to respond right now.
I have some maid of honor things to do before Blair and Louis leave.
But I really hope we can talk later.
Lola.
You're an actress in your second year at Juilliard.
You're from Miami.
You work these jobs to pay for school because your mother doesn't support you, and everyone talked about how great the office party was for weeks after, so thank you.
You're welcome.
And, uh I'm impressed.
Well, maybe I'm not the kind of person you thought I was after all.
Oh, no, you probably still are, but for the first time, I'm actually a little interested in finding out.
Ladies and gentlemen, please direct your attention to where prince Louis Frederic Grimaldi and princess Blair Cornelia Waldorf Grimaldi will be sharing their last dance before departing on their honeymoon.
Oh, my God.
Princess Blair.
That's the first time I've heard it.
And? Thank you for giving me another chance.
Oh, Louis, the champagne hasn't gone to my head.
I'm too high for it to reach me.
We've made it, finally.
So we did.
What is it, mon cher? Did I miss a step? I promised my mother I'd wait until we were on the plane, but I can't any longer.
Wait for what? Today with the eyes of the world on us, I had no choice but to stand by your side after your public apology.
But that was it.
From this moment forward, there is nothing between us but a contract.
Our marriage is all for show.
And you're going to put on the best damn show anyone ever has.
Oh, my God.
You'll smile for cameras, stand by my side, and wave like-- like you don't have a care in the world.
But when we are alone, we'll be like strangers to one another, and it will stay that way until I say it's over.
But what about everything we've been through? All those beautiful vows you said in front of God and everyone? Those can't just have stopped being true.
I didn't write them.
Dan did.
And now they mean nothing to me.
But why? Why would you wanna be married to someone you don't love? My mother told me love had nothing to do with marriage.
Now I know she was right.
Smile.
Smile for the photographers.
Weddings mark one of the largest transitions you can make in your life.
They are a new beginning, the next step in a person's evolution.
But evolving is a tricky thing.
You can't change without changing the world around you.
It's me.
I made a horrible mistake and I don't know what to do.
Help me.
Please.
And not everyone might see your transformation the same way you do.
Arthur, bring the car around.
We need to get to the St.
Regis fast.
But if you can make it through and truly be reborn, then maybe so can I.
Hey, have you seen Dan? The coordinator wants photos of us dancing.
Yeah, I just saw him a few minutes ago.
Hey, maybe check the other rooms.
Okay.
So beginning today, the past is just a prologue.
It all starts from here.
Chuck, what are you doing here? - If anyone sees you - I need to apologize to Blair.
Where is she? This was the only car with the keys in it.
That's fine.
Just go.
Oh, and if you're wondering who caught the bouquet I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.
O.
X.
O.
Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here-- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I love you, Dan Humphrey.
Serena I really hope we can talk later.
Charlie! I'm sorry.
I thought you were Charlotte Rhodes.
I am, yeah.
People call me "Lola.
" And you are? Looking for a different Charlotte Rhodes.
If they ever found out the truth about the real Charlotte Rhodes, they would never forgive me.
I'm, uh Nate Archibald.
Yeah.
I worked your office Christmas party, remember? "A true American princess"? "The next Diana"? If this is supposed to be her happiest day, then I can't wait to rain all over her parade.
Why do you need this? What's the point of doing something scandalous if you don't record it? Of course I love you, Chuck.
I've always loved you.
I love you more and more every day, if it's even possible to love someone that much.
From this moment forward, there is nothing between us but a contract.
Our marriage is all for show, and you're going to put on the best damn show anyone ever has.
This was the only car with the keys in it.
It's fine.
Just go.
You know you love me X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Everyone wants their wedding to be perfect.
But on the Upper East Side, perfect isn't good enough.
Although some disasters can't be avoided.
Excuse me.
Have you seen the bride? No.
Sorry.
Rufus, mom, hey, do you guys know where Blair is? No, I've not seen her since the newlyweds' last dance.
And where have you been, young lady? Your mother and I have been showing off our moves on the dance floor, and you and Dan should join us.
Oh, that sounds great, except I have to find Blair.
All right, suit yourself.
Hey.
Hi.
Eleanor, do you know where Blair is? I haven't been able to track her down.
Oh, I'm sure she and Louis are off having a private moment to let it all soak in before making their grand exit.
Okay.
Serena? Blair seems happy, doesn't she, with Louis? Of course.
I mean, she--she loves Louis, and she's a princess now.
Mm.
So you know, as soon as that soaks in, I'm sure she'll be beyond happy.
I hope so.
That's all I want-- is for her to be happy.
I hope she knows that.
I'm sure she does.
Enjoy.
Thank you for coming.
I'll tell Blair you said good-bye.
Oh, I was worried you left for your honeymoon already.
Oh.
Please tell me you know where Blair is.
I, uh, I believe she went to the powder room to freshen up.
Okay, I-I won't keep her long.
I know you guys have to leave soon.
Okay.
But no matter how you might plan for perfection, there's always a hitch.
Blair confessing her love for Chuck at her own wedding is the best thing to happen to "Gossip Girl" in years.
So this is the big scandal you wanted? Not quite.
Blair still married the twerp.
But she left the reception early.
Something's wrong.
I just have to figure out what it is.
Right now? Aren't you exhausted? On the contrary.
I've never felt more invigorated.
I can't find Blair anywhere.
I checked every stall in the building.
Did you check her room upstairs? Three times.
I even had security look at the roof.
Why would she be on the roof? I don't know.
Maybe I've seen "The Hangover" too many times.
It just-- it doesn't make sense.
Why isn't she dancing with her dads or saying "good night"s with Louis? I can't believe she had me keep her phone for her.
Security at the Empire.
Hello? What? Oh, it's it's fine.
I'll be right there.
It appears our question's been answered.
Blair's at my place.
You must be pretty desperate to flirt with me by doing manual labor.
What? This isn't flirting.
I've always wanted to load a catering van.
One more thing to cross off my bucket list, right? Nate, what are you doing down here? Oh, I'm just lending a hand.
These things are heavier than you think.
Pretty desperate, Nathaniel, although it looks worth it.
Just so you know, Blair left without telling anyone and fled to the Empire.
We're headed over there now to find out what happened.
Arthur should be here by now.
I told him to pull the car around back so nobody would see us leave.
Oh, you could be waiting a while.
The bride and groom are supposed to be leaving since there are photographers everywhere.
Traffic is a mess out front.
Luckily, this lets out onto a side street, so I can take the van out that way and avoid the mess.
Look like we might need your van.
Or maybe we can ask nicely for her to give us a ride? Please, it's-- it's for the bride.
She's run away from her own wedding without telling anyone, and we just need to find her and make sure she's okay.
I know that you don't know us-- Wait.
The princess is a runaway bride? And you guys are going to look for her? Yeah, I'm so in.
I'll--I'll drive.
Great.
Thank you so much.
What? I'm worried about Blair, too.
Thank you for coming.
Merci.
Merci beaucoup.
Bonsoir.
Mother.
Keep smiling.
Pretend that everything is fine.
Why? What's going on? People wish to bid farewell to the happy couple, and I'm hearing that your bride is nowhere to be found.
Maybe you should tell me what is going on.
I was so angry.
I couldn't wait.
What did you tell her? Everything we discussed.
That after humiliating me, she will be my wife in name only.
What were you thinking? The press is outside awaiting your departure, and there are hundreds of guests here.
This is why I told you to wait.
Blair needs to be by your side this instant.
I fear she may have left.
The reception is winding down.
I will tell the press that the happy couple have slipped out back.
In the meantime, I'll find out if Eleanor knows where her daughter is.
Prince Louis may not have been left at the altar, but the honeymoon appears to be over before it begins.
Blair? Hey, guys.
Beautiful wedding, huh? What have you done with Blair? Nothing, except tell the dumbest member of your security team that I was her.
Sorry.
I had to get your attention somehow.
This is Georgina Sparks.
She's pretty much the worst person you'll ever meet, so just avoid eye contact at all times.
Georgina, what are you up to? Why do you always assume my motives are nefarious? Well look, I felt bad for filming the video, and I'm trying.
So when I saw Blair hightail it out of the reception without her frog prince, I knew I had to help.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Here's hoping.
You saw Blair leave? Where was she going? I don't know.
But if you want to find her, I was the last person to lay eyes on her, so you're going to need my help.
Looks like everyone wants to know where the royal bride ran to, but will they find her in time? I-I don't understand.
The Dominican Republic? Louis may not agree to a divorce here in the states, but I think I can get one there without his consent.
Well, was researching divorce law part of your wedding prep? Because that should have been your first sign.
Elizabeth Taylor got her fourth divorce there.
There's some weird loophole in the law where you don't need the groom.
Or maybe they just take bribes.
Either way, I'll figure it out when I get there.
Is this all because of Chuck? I mean, I-I can't believe he sent that video in to "Gossip Girl.
" No.
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe.
It's just the second that video came out, Louis transformed into a totally different person.
So the sooner I can free myself of him, the sooner I can get on with my life.
So you wanna go to the Dominican Republic right now? Do you know a better way out of this? The white zone is for loading You sure about this? All right, then let's get you on the next flight to Santo Domingo.
You can run, and you can hide, but, Princess B.
, beware.
Gossip Girl has eyes everywhere.
We may have an open seat on a connecting flight through Orlando.
Let me just get my supervisor.
Thank you.
What is the holdup, Humphrey? People are starting to stare.
All the direct flights are booked, but she's working on it, unless you'd prefer three connections.
Whatever gets me out of here the fastest.
If someone were to recognize me and Louis figured out where I was going, he would try to stop me.
Somehow I think that dragging you out of here kicking and screaming is exactly the kind of embarrassment you're trying to avoid, right? No, I mean that he would try to stop me from getting a divorce.
The Grimaldis have a great deal of international influence.
One call to a diplomat in the Dominican Republic, and I can kiss my one shot at freedom good-bye.
Oh, my God.
That's Blair Waldorf.
Great.
It is going to be Bieber fever in here in about one minute.
I mean, everyone is staring.
Relax.
They're staring at you because you're wearing a wedding dress.
Yeah.
Right.
You-- you have a point.
Hey, hey! Yes, you.
You seem to have reasonably good taste.
What do you think about trading me this gorgeous, one-of-a-kind Vera Wang for the least offensive thing in your suitcase? Tell me you know who Vera Wang is, or keep walking.
Wait a minute.
Are you her? Are you the Princess of Monaco? Oh, my God.
Are you on your honeymoon? Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
The prince must be here.
Where is he? No, uh, I'm not her.
It's true.
They just bear an uncanny resemblance to one another in every way.
Yeah.
We--we are decoys, a-a distraction so that the real royal couple doesn't get mobbed by tabloid-obsessed losers like yourself.
No offense.
Now that I get a better look, you're not nearly as pretty as Blair Waldorf.
And he's terrible.
You think I'd be insulted by someone with a Samsonite? Look, I just need to change, so lend me your credit card so I can go shopping while you get my ticket.
They do give credit to people from Brooklyn, right? Oh, hey, Serena, what's up? Hey, sorry I disappeared from the reception.
I spilled red wine all over my dress, if you can believe it.
And I went home to change, and with traffic, it's just taking longer than I expected.
Yeah, no worries.
I mean, I-I didn't even realize you'd left.
Oh.
Um well, do you know where Blair is? I need to talk to her, but I have her phone, and I'm sure she's around there somewhere, right? Blair? Um you know what? You just missed her.
She--she left-- she left with Louis.
Oh.
They left together? Yeah.
I mean, isn't that what they do at weddings? Anyway, they're gone.
You know, they're gone.
They're, uh, probably on their honeymoon now.
You really should come back, 'cause it's-- it's kinda done here.
You sound weird.
No, I don't.
Uh, is this--is this about what I said to you earlier? No, no, no, not at all.
It's-- I mean, I'm just--I'm tired from all the dancing.
I should have given it a rest after "Funky Cold Medina.
" Look, I know that I said you don't have to say anything, but don't you have anything to say? I do.
I do, but I just-- I gotta go to the bathroom.
I mean, I'm walking in the men's room right now.
Can I just--I'm gonna call you later, all right? Dan says Blair left with Louis.
Maybe we're overreacting.
You're not.
Dan's lying.
He's gotten pretty good at it, too.
Seriously? You think you stand out less in that? Anything "I heart New York" is the perfect camouflage.
A true new yorker wouldn't be caught dead in it.
She wouldn't give me your ticket without you here, but I got you a seat on the next flight.
It's like 36E or something like that.
Coach? Yeah, which is also the perfect camouflage.
It cost me a fortune since it's so last minute.
You're welcome.
Okay, then I just need your passport so we can issue the ticket.
Oh, my God.
Her passport.
Once again, Humphrey, I am one step ahead of you.
Now I know it's unorthodox, but this is an emergency, and I don't have my passport.
So I'm hoping that you will allow me to prove identity with this.
Don't believe her! She's a decoy.
She told me so herself.
And check out how bad the prince is.
Okay, once was enough.
Look, I am Blair Waldorf.
See? Okay, this is probably not the best way to go unnoticed.
Great.
Now I need a passport to prove I'm me? If that stupid video had never come out, none of this would have happened! I'll get Dorota to bring it to me.
Give me your phone.
There's no way I'm believing Georgina over Dan, and Dan said that Blair left with Louis.
Why do you automatically assume that I'm the one lying? If your opinion actually mattered to me, I'd be insulted.
Why are you still here? Don't you have a hole to crawl back into? I want to help.
Let's think of the possibilities.
Ideas? Anyone? Who are you calling? Security.
You overstayed your welcome when you showed up.
Hey, it's me.
Can you send someone up to the penthouse? Yeah, I have a situation.
No need for security.
The jig is up.
Ah, you caught me.
I have been lying.
Um, I don't know what to say.
I'm bored, and my DVR is empty.
Listen, I can normally keep this up for hours, but I have a kid now, and his mommy and me group is way more fun to mess with than you guys.
Bye.
Wow, seriously? What is her problem? Hey, I'm-- I'm sorry Blair wasn't here.
I know you were hoping she would run to you.
I should've known it wasn't her.
I need to make peace with the fact that it's over.
Whoever released that video killed whatever chance I had with her.
Your phone's ringing.
No, no, it's Blair's.
It's a text from Louis.
That's weird if they're together.
"Where the hell are you? Get back here this instant.
" Thank you so much for continuing the night with me.
I have so much adrenaline, I can't possibly sleep.
It's too bad that the men in our lives are such bores.
Hey, I'm still here.
And I'm fairly certain that Lily and I weren't boring when we closed out the dance floor to "Moves Like Jagger.
" Oh, let me tell you, even Jagger couldn't move like Jagger in these heels.
I hope you don't mind if I go change into some flats.
Oh, go right ahead.
Shall I open a bottle? Oh.
What a wonderful reception.
Yes.
I only wish that Blair and Louis had not snuck out without saying good-bye.
I know.
Perhaps they were overwhelmed with well-wishers.
I have an idea.
Hmm? Why don't we invite the newlyweds to stop by here before they leave for their honeymoon? Louis has turned his cell phone off, but maybe you could reach Blair.
I doubt we could catch them.
Well, how will you know until you try? Honestly, after the day that they have had, I'm sure that they would prefer to be by themselves, and you know what? I'm kind of beat.
Perhaps I should go home.
But Rufus has just opened a bottle of wine.
It would be rude to leave now.
Just one glass, at least.
And I've opened one of our favorites.
After all, it is a special occasion.
Ah, ladies, please make yourself at home.
Will you excuse me? Hello? Dad, it's me.
Hey.
Uh, don't tell anyone I'm calling, and please don't freak out, but I'm at the airport right now with Blair.
She's going to the Dominican Republic to get a divorce.
What are you talking about? You just gotta trust me.
She--she made a terrible mistake marrying Louis, and he's not at all who he seems, so she's gotta flee the country to make sure he doesn't find out where she is.
And--and you're going with her? No, no, I'm just helping out, which is why I'm calling.
I need you to help make sure that Louis and his family don't know that she's trying to leave the city.
I mean, I'm sure they're already looking for her, and it's only a matter of time before they think to look here.
I'm with Sophie and Eleanor now.
Um, they think she's with Louis.
Oh, good.
Well, then keep it that way as long as possible.
I don't think Blair should be dragging you into this.
She needs me, dad.
If--if you could see how upset she is, you would understand.
Please, please, just stall them.
All right, I trust you're doing the right thing.
I'll do what I can to help.
Hey.
Your battery's about to die.
I know.
I just had to use a pay phone to ask my dad to buy us more time.
You told Rufus? That goody-goody will squeal the first chance he gets.
Oh, you trust Dorota? I pay her to stay loyal.
Rufus is always doing the right thing.
I'm sure he's already told my mother, which means everyone will instantly know that she knows.
She refuses to get Botox.
Her face is an emoticon.
Louis won't find out, all right? Listen, I-I don't think that you fully comprehend the urgency of my situation.
You know what everyone says they did to Charlene Wittstock when she tried to run, and she was an Olympian.
Okay, these people don't mess around.
I need to resolve this as quickly and as quietly as possible.
You'll be fine.
Rufus and Dorota are the only two people who know where we are, and I guarantee they won't tell a soul.
Going somewhere? Since miss Blair gone on honeymoon, I take small trip myself.
Mm-hmm.
With your employer's Vuitton.
I don't think so.
I tell you nothing.
We'll see about that.
You remember when your husband took me on that small trip to Russia? It's payback time.
Careful, B.
Loyalty's only worth so much until there's a bigger price on your head.
Still no word from Blair? No.
I'm--I'm sure they're in the air by now, champagne toasting at Do you honestly expect me to believe that? Excuse me? Louis is in a limo downstairs, and Blair is nowhere to be found.
Enough with the niceties.
Tell me where she is.
I'm sorry.
Where is my daughter? I will not stand for the humiliation of my son being left on his wedding day.
If you cannot get Blair to return, then you will be required to fulfill the dowry that we so generously waived.
First of all, I thought my daughter was with your son.
And as for the dowry, it was waived because it's antiquated and outrageous.
You cannot force us to pay it.
It's all in the prenuptial agreement.
If she defaults on the marriage, the dowry can be reinstated.
So it is everyone's best interests for Blair to return.
How am I supposed to get Blair to return if I don't know where she is? Ah, I'm sorry that took so long.
My new Loeffler Randalls had scuff marks on them, but they came right off.
So what did I miss? I was just about to tell everyone that the flower arrangements at the reception were so beautiful, I thought we each should have one.
So I called over to catering, and they're sending some over.
Oh, what a lovely idea.
Well, they should be here any minute, so while we wait, who wants more wine? Thank you for your hospitality, but I'm afraid I must be going.
I was hoping to avoid this, but if you won't tell me where she is, I have other ways of finding out.
Everything okay? Oh, yeah, my boss wants me to help with something, but I'm off the clock, so he can find someone else.
Yeah, I'm so glad we're done.
I'm just exhausted after all that work we had to do.
You know, I like a man who can make a good Martini but I could actually go for a cold beer right now.
Do you have one, or is that too blue collar for you? Of course.
Hold on.
Hello? Hi, mom.
No, that's because I'm at the library studying for a marketing exam.
No, the snowstorm's not that bad, I promise.
It's, like, not even a foot.
Yeah.
Can I call you back when I'm done? Okay.
Bye.
Who's that? Oh, it's my boss again.
Doesn't like to take no for an answer, I guess.
Yeah.
Well, uh, hey, listen, I'm really sorry to do this, but I actually am exhausted after the wedding and Blair missing.
It's just kind of all hitting me right now, so Oh, okay.
That's probably for the best.
Maybe I'll do that job after all.
It was stupid of me to turn down the extra money.
I'll just put this back.
Did you find anyone for that job? We're now live on Manhattan's Upper East Side with prince Louis Grimaldi of Monaco.
What is it? Is Dorota here? No, it's Louis.
Where? As most of you know, Blair Waldorf and I were married in a ceremony earlier today.
Mere hours after our "I dos" He must know I left Manhattan.
I told you Rufus would rat me out.
Blair has now been reported a missing person.
At this time, we are doing everything we can to locate her, but we need your help.
Blair is an extraordinary woman, but after a recent personal tragedy, and the stress surrounding a wedding of this magnitude, she has not been herself.
If anyone sees her, please contact the authorities immediately.
I can't believe it.
They went to the press.
I thought they wanted to avoid embarrassment.
No, this way, they can spin it so that I look crazy.
So why not go to the press yourself? No, they still win.
They find me, they find a way to stop me.
We should go right now.
But where? We can't go back to the city.
The next flight out is tomorrow morning.
I'll find a hotel and text Dorota to meet us there.
Is there a Four Seasons in Queens? Well, at least we know she hasn't fled the country.
Mr.
Chuck.
I was only trying them on.
I was So bored locked inside.
Thankfully, miss Georgina a mother, and she--she not leave me without snacks.
Georgina did this to you? She want to find miss Blair, but not to worry.
I tell her wrong place.
You know where Blair is? Yes, miss Blair was at airport but now going to hotel waiting for me to bring passport.
Something about Elizabeth Taylor.
Oh, my God.
Blair wants a divorce.
That is my hope.
Before I was locked in closet, Mr.
Louis was calling and calling.
He said he want to find miss Blair and get her help she needs, which in romance novels, means locking her forever in tall tower.
I need to get miss Blair her passport so she can get away very fast.
We'll take it from here.
I told you it wouldn't be long.
Follow that car.
Sometimes when you want things done right, you have to rely on others to do them for you.
Looks like we succeeded in finding Blair by using the press.
Photos of her with the airport are surfacing all over the Internet.
Where is she now? She was seen leaving the airport 20 minutes ago.
That's the last account.
Did Eleanor give you any information? Either she knows absolutely nothing or she is a talented liar.
Either way, I have made it quite clear that they will pay if Blair continues this charade.
So what do we do now? Is it Blair? No, it's from "Gossip Girl.
" I think the hotel clerk recognized me.
Did you notice him staring? You mean after you lectured him about their lack of spa amenities? I can't believe that in just a few short hours, I went from being a princess with a private jet and a palace to flying coach and hiding out in an airport hotel room with Dan Humphrey.
What have I done to deserve this? How about what I've done? Like be there for you completely and without question, and you still treat me like crap.
Would it kill you to be just the tiniest bit appreciative? In case you haven't noticed, I'm not exactly having fun either.
This was supposed to be the best day of my life, and now it's a big mess, and you don't need to be yelling at me on top of it! If you haven't noticed, I've been helping you the entire time, and you're the one who's yelling! All right, now I'm yelling, too, but you started it.
I hope someone yells at you on your big day so you know how it feels! You already did! You remember the day my book came out? You blamed me for creating all your problems with Louis, and you never even read it.
I read the most important part-- the part that never happened.
Look, all I've ever tried to do was be your friend, but friends don't treat each other the way you treat me, so if you really think you're better off without me, then why don't you try it out? That's right.
Go ahead and leave.
I didn't want you in the car, and I don't need you now.
Fine.
Fine.
Good-bye.
Bye! That's not a Dorota knock.
She's a stickler for "Shave and a Haircut.
" I'm so sorry, Eleanor.
I'm sure that Blair will turn up soon.
I thought she'd be on her way to Bali by now.
I just wish that she felt that she could have turned to me if she was having second thoughts.
Not knowing where she is or if she's okay-- that's the hardest part.
Blair's fine.
She's with Dan.
How long have you known this? He called earlier.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you, but I promised Dan that I wouldn't say anything.
There are enormous consequences if she doesn't return.
I have to speak to her immediately.
Where is she? Dan? Humphrey? What are you guys doing here? Funny.
We were just about to ask you the same thing.
Where's Blair? I'm right here.
How did you find me? You didn't tell Louis, did you? Dorota said you needed your passport.
The Dominican Republic? Really? Are you seriously doing this? Louis doesn't care about me.
All he wants is to hold me hostage.
So you ran away with Humphrey, and he brought you here? No.
Well, I was just leaving.
Wait, wait, wait.
You knew we were looking for Blair.
Why did you lie to us? She told me not to tell anyone.
Well, I didn't know you talked to her.
You do realize she falls under the term "anyone," right? I'm not just anyone.
I'm her best friend.
How--what--how am I the bad guy here? She dragged me into all this.
Technically, I just wanted the car.
All right, well, now that your real friends are here to help you, I'm gonna leave.
Oh, oh, group shot.
No.
Seriously, Georgina? I'm outta here.
Serena, you found my camera.
And here I thought it and its touching movie of Blair and Chuck were gone for good.
Well, at the very least, I guess this solves who sent in that video to "Gossip Girl" and ruined Blair's marriage.
My work here is done and documented.
Thank you.
Lily, I wanted to tell you.
Well, no need to apologize to me, but poor Eleanor.
She's probably upset because her daughter doesn't trust her as much as Dan trusts you.
Let's just hope he continues to trust me after Eleanor shows up to drag Blair home.
Well, telling her was the right thing to do.
Hi.
I'm Lola from the catering company.
Where do you want these? Charlotte Rhodes? Uh, my husband and I were looking for my niece with the same name, remember? Oh, yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
Did you ever find her? She was with her mother.
I can't believe you're delivering the flowers.
Did you work the Grimaldi wedding? Yeah.
Small world.
Yeah, it's just a part-time gig while I'm in school.
Pays for the dorm.
Honey.
Ahem.
Oh! Yeah, let me take those.
Okay.
Thank you.
I'm sorry to drag you here so late.
Oh, no, don't worry about it.
I get the overtime, and, actually, you saved me from something with this guy that I met at the wedding.
Oh, is everything okay? Yeah.
I broke two of my own rules-- no dating party guests and no dating guys named Nate, Luke, or Troy.
Usually lacrosse players, always trouble.
You don't mean Nate Archibald? Oh, yeah.
You know him? Yes, very well.
He's actually a lovely young man.
Maybe so.
All I know is, as soon as I showed interest, suddenly he lost any he had.
It's fine.
He's a "Nate.
" I'm gonna head back and help the cleanup crew, but it was nice seeing you again.
You, too.
It was you who sent in that video to "Gossip Girl"? And set me up to take the fall? Um yeah.
Yeah, fine.
It was, um It was me who did it, but I did it for the two of you.
You ruined my wedding for me? I know you never believed in my pact, but this wasn't your choice to make.
I didn't do it to hurt you, Blair.
But you choosing to run away with Dan, knowing how I feel about him and not telling me any of it-- that hurt, too.
I can charter a plane.
We can be in the Dominican Republic by sunrise.
Chuck Blair will not be going anywhere with anyone but my son.
Uh-oh, B.
Looks like you were right about their royal reach.
Hope your plane ticket's refundable.
Not even a day into your marriage, and already in breach of your prenuptial agreement with your illicit lover.
You don't know what you're talking about.
How did you find me? Did Rufus sell me out? Or is one of the buttons on my wedding dress actually a GPS locator? I wouldn't put it past you people.
You are the princess of Monaco.
Privacy is no longer an option.
But you should be used to that by now.
"Gossip Girl" seems to know more about you than your own mother.
"Gossip Girl" told you she was here? I'm not going back with you.
I'm afraid you must.
My son awaits your return in the city, but if you refuse to join him, you and your family will quite literally pay the consequence.
Or did you forget about the dowry? A dowry? What century do you think this is? If you don't recall, the price is pretty steep.
I imagine your mother will be forced to sell her company.
So it is up to you.
Do you prefer to spend the next year as a princess or as a pauper? I can find somewhere else to wait for my car.
No, Serena, hold on.
Look.
I only lied to you to help Blair.
She was--she was panicked and running away from her wedding.
I was just trying to protect her from Louis.
Well, if you were really trying to help, then you would have told me, because I could have helped her, too.
But you saw the chance to be her only savior, her knight in shining armor.
I won't apologize for helping a friend.
And apparently, you're not gonna apologize for lying to one, either.
Are you really mad about Blair, or is this about us? About what you said at the wedding, and because I haven't given you an answer yet? You just did.
I'm sorry I blamed you for releasing that video.
It's understandable.
Everyone knows I'm the obvious choice.
I'm just glad you know it wasn't me who did it, and now we can get out of here and start over.
Hey.
Don't worry.
I'll protect you from Louis and whatever his mother threatens to do.
If there's a dowry, I'll pay it.
I can't let you buy my freedom.
If it means getting rid of them, it's worth whatever the cost.
I'd do anything for you.
No.
Not like this.
I I made a promise, and I need to keep it.
To God? You broke that promise when you left Louis.
And look, I'm still standing.
Chuck, I need you to let me handle this on my own.
What kind of chance do we have if our fresh start is you buying me from Louis? When and if we end up together, it has to be as equals, with nothing over our heads.
That's the only shot we have.
I can't stand the thought of you with anyone else.
I don't care what it costs or where we have to go.
I just wanna be with you.
Louis won't lay a hand on me, I promise.
I'm sorry.
This is how it has to be.
If you're looking for Serena, she's, uh, she's on her way back to the city.
I was looking for you.
I want to apologize.
Everything you said was right.
I could never have survived this last month without you.
I also know you wrote those vows.
Well, you know, Louis asked me to.
I-I just--I just tried to write down what I assumed he would love about you.
Well, you did a great job.
It's pretty obvious you care way more about me than Louis.
As a friend, of course.
No, of course.
And I care about you, too, even if I have odd ways of showing it like, you know, bossing you around or making fun of your hair.
Seriously, you should cut it already.
Thank you for helping me.
And I really am sorry for maxing out your credit card and not reading your book.
Well, listen, you have much bigger problems to deal with.
Speaking of, what now? I know what I have to do, but I just need to know that you'll be there for me.
Always.
I was hoping I'd find you back here.
How did you Lily called me.
She said I might owe you an explanation for ending our date.
Oh, it wasn't a date, and you don't.
Well, I think I do.
Truth is, I have a history with girls who lie, and you seemed really honest and straightforward, which I liked.
But then I overhead a conversation with your mom, and, uh My mom.
Where to begin? Well, to start, she's insanely overprotective.
She never wanted me to be an actress and said that New York would destroy my soul.
So I lie and tell her that I'm at Michigan State, Poli Sci major.
I love her, but I'm doing it to protect her and myself.
I don't know.
Family can be tricky.
No, I know.
I just went through this huge thing with my grandfather and my cousin, and suddenly I'm left with no family at all, so I can relate.
Although my cousin did try and have me killed, so maybe our situations are slightly different.
But I'm sorry.
I should have asked you earlier.
How about a do-over? Well, if I'm being honest, um it's really fun to hear about your world, but I don't know if wanna be in it.
No, I understand.
So, uh, thank you for being honest.
There you are.
I've been looking for your mother.
She isn't here.
Well, I'll just have to tell you.
I know where Blair is, and I have no intention of sharing that information with any of the Grimaldis.
In fact, when I see her, I am going to tell her I don't care what I have to sell.
I want her to stay as far away from you as possible.
In fact, for future reference, the Waldorfs do not give in to threats.
Your family cannot control mine.
Yes, they can.
Louis I'm ready to go on our honeymoon now.
My bags are in the car downstairs.
Blair, you do not have to do this.
You do not have to go with him.
Yes, I do.
I heard what you said, mother, but I don't believe in saving myself and ruining our family at the same time.
It's just a year.
It's not that long, right? Sweetheart.
Everything okay? Fine.
Thank you for bringing that up And for everything else.
I meant what I said.
Whatever you need, I'm here for you.
We need to go.
Don't look so sad, B.
At least your prison is a palace.
Wait.
You're posting a video of Blair with Louis? What about the photo of everyone at the airport hotel? Isn't that the scoop you were looking for? No.
That photo has been rendered irrelevant due to the fact that Blair and Louis are together right now, leaving for their honeymoon.
But tomorrow's another day.
You forget I know who sent the video of Blair and Chuck to "Gossip Girl" in the first place.
But you can't reveal your source.
Everyone would stop sending tips.
Oh, darling, of course they would, which is why I have something else planned.
My dear, sweet Philip.
Since Gossip Girl abandoned her post after Blair's accident, it's been my civic duty to step in and continue her important work.
It's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it.
The world needs Gossip Girl.
I'm gonna grab a water.
Why did she choose him? I would have done anything for her.
I know, but you shouldn't have sent that video in to "Gossip Girl.
" Don't you mean you shouldn't have? Come on, Chuck.
You can stop pretending now.
I found the camera where you left it in the bridal chamber, and I put it in my purse.
I figured it was worth lying and saying that I did it if--if you two could be together again.
I wasn't lying.
I didn't do it.
But if--if you didn't do it, and I didn't, then who did? Some secrets I'll never tell.
But most secrets make for excellent blackmail material.
That's how it goes on the Upper East Side.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here-- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
This is my granddaughter, Charlie Rhodes.
No one can touch me anymore.
I'm a Rhodes now.
Charlotte Rhodes? My husband and I were looking for my niece with the same name, remember? Did you ever find her? She was with her mother.
If they ever found out the truth about the real Charlotte Rhodes, they would never forgive me.
I'm leaving tonight.
This time, I'm not coming back.
You must be pretty desperate to flirt with me by doing manual labor.
This isn't flirting.
I've always wanted to load a catering van.
I love you, Dan Humphrey.
Always have.
Always will.
You saw the chance to be her only savior, her knight in shining armor.
Are you really mad about Blair, or is this about us, because I haven't given you an answer yet? You just did.
Of course I love you, Chuck.
I've always loved you.
I know who sent the video of Blair and Chuck to "Gossip Girl" in the first place.
It's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it.
There is nothing between us but a contract.
Our marriage is all for show.
You and your family will quite literally pay the consequence, or did you forget about the dowry? Your family cannot control mine.
Yes, they can.
I don't believe in saving myself and ruining our family at the same time.
Another picture-perfect Valentine's Day on the Upper East Side, and how am I going to celebrate? By exposing a giant secret today that's sure to break more than a few hearts.
You can just drop those right there.
Thank you.
Miss Blair! You're back! Oh! I-I was worried you'd be locked away in big, stone tower somewhere and only way to speak is through smoke signals or coded messages on Twitter.
Thankfully, Dorota, we don't need to learn Navajo just yet.
The truth is, after our horrid faux honeymoon, I think Louis was glad to get back to Monaco and be rid of me for a little while.
So this mean you no longer trapped in his evil grasp.
Not exactly.
Dorota, this is Estee, A.
K.
A.
my new social secretary.
A.
K.
A.
my royal minder, but I've just been calling her "Creeper" for short.
Estee will be accompanying me now on all official public outings.
Did I mention she also reads my mail and performs nightly bed checks? Blair's first public appearance will be this evening, just as soon as she picks one of these charity galas to make her official debut as princess.
How great is that? Oh, wow, that's beautiful.
Good morning.
Wh-what's all this? It's called Valentine's Day, Dan.
I'm picking out some Cartier jewelry to give to Lily tonight.
So where is she? Aren't you afraid she's gonna see it? Mm, she's in D.
C.
at a fund-raiser luncheon.
Won't be back till this afternoon.
And tonight, Chuck has hooked us up with a huge suite at the Empire.
Pretty romantic, right? Yeah, that sounds nice.
Can I interest you in anything? Something for your, uh, special lady? Me? No, no, no.
I have no special lady this year.
Honestly, I was just coming by to pick up those Blu-Rays I let Lily borrow.
Uh Thought maybe I could give them to Blair.
You know, she's back from her honeymoon alone, so So you figure that if you, uh, drop them off, maybe she'll ask you to watch one with her.
Well, cinema's always been intended as a communal art.
It's better to watch with another person.
She's a married woman now, Dan.
It might be time to move on.
I appreciate the advice, dad, but I'm just trying to be a good friend.
Really, it doesn't mean anything.
Okay.
I can't stand seeing all these happy people, smiling, holding hands, kissing.
Don't remind me.
Guess it's only natural when you and I feel this anti-Valentine's Day.
It hasn't exactly been a banner year for either of us in the romance department.
At least the person you love told you they felt the same.
Mine didn't even respond.
Well, the good news is, this outsized outpouring display of public affection will be over tomorrow.
Then New Yorkers can go back to being their usual cold, callous selves.
Hang in there.
Yeah, you, too.
Oh, I love them! Ohh! Sorry.
Have a good day.
I doubt that.
Oh, hey, I guess the honeymoon's over.
Just the person I wanted to see.
I can't talk now.
I'm busy.
Wait, wait, wait, stop.
I will not allow us to go on living like this together.
The way I see it, I am mad at you for sending out that video of me and Chuck to "Gossip Girl," and you are mad at me for running off with Dan.
So they cancel each other out.
Actually, yours was way worse.
I-I only needed a ride, but the point is-- Blair, I didn't release the video to "Gossip Girl.
" You took the fall for us? It seemed like the right thing to do at the time.
Well, since you're clearly looking out for my best interests, I forgive you.
Now can you forgive me for using your wedding date as a getaway driver? Well, I was never really mad at you.
Okay, well, tell me what incredible romantic plans you have for today.
Oh, you know, just interviewing a 70-year-old avowed celibate woman for my "All the reasons I hate Valentine's Day" column, and trying to figure out ways not to become her.
That sounds like an absolutely awful Valentine's Day.
They've all been pretty awful for the past few years.
The last good one I had was in high school with-- Hey.
Oh! You were about to say "with him.
" I have to go.
I heard you were back, and I suspected you might not have any big plans tonight, so I thought I would, uh, drop off some movies.
Oh.
I could come back and watch them with you.
I mean, under the radar, of course.
That is sweet, but I actually already have plans to go back on the radar, which you should, too.
You should go out with someone.
Have fun.
If only it were that easy.
I don't think I've had a real date on Valentine's Day since, uh, since high school with well, Serena.
I've gotta go meet Alessandra at Fig & Olive to discuss my next opus, so have a nice night.
You, too, Dan.
Dorota! I am suddenly feeling inspired, which is why I want to upgrade my royal status from princess to queen of hearts.
And what that mean exactly? It means that I will do everything in my power to get Dan and Serena back together.
Hello? Lola, hey, it's Nate.
Who? Archibald.
From the wedding.
Oh, that Nate.
The one I don't remember giving my number to.
Yeah, well, I might have put a little pressure on your boss.
Blackmailing bosses may have been the reason I didn't give you my number in the first place.
Hey, I only offered him some free advertising in "The Spectator," all right? Technically, that's more of a bribe.
All right, either way, what are you doing tonight? And whatever excuse you're about to give, I'm gonna poke holes in it, okay? Do you have any idea how cheesy it is to ask a girl out for a first date on Valentine's Day? Well, I prefer bold and charming to cheesy, but that's just-- Also, did you forget that I'm a cater waiter? Because Valentine's is one of our busiest nights of the year, so thanks for asking.
Lola? Okay, Tina, my other informants have come up with nothing but a new princess under a lonely boy with no plans, and a dog lover who hates the entire holiday.
Please tell me you have something better.
I'm afraid not.
Nate can't even get a cater waiter to go out with him.
What the hell am I paying you people for? What am I gonna do? Under my stewardship, "Gossip Girl" is but a shell of her former self, like AOL or Courtney Love.
The only way to remedy this is with a scandal to end all scandals.
You have a scandal.
Dan Humphrey is the one who sent you that video of Chuck and Blair at Blair's wedding.
And with that to hold over his head, you could get Dan to do almost everything.
Philip, it's cute when you pay attention.
But if I'm going to load up Dan like a hirsute hand grenade, I need everyone to be there when he detonates.
Ugh! It was so much easier to stir stuff up when we were all in high school and at the same place all the time.
No.
It's too bad you can't all jump into a time machine and go back to high school then, huh? Ohh.
Sweetie.
I knew I married you for a reason Besides your money.
Why didn't you tell me about the party? Which party? The "Come As You Were" party you're throwing here tonight.
It's all over "Gossip Girl.
" Dress as your high school self.
That's awesome.
I wish you would have given me a little more notice, though.
I have to deck the place out.
I have to get the gift bags ready.
I have to-- - Tina, I'm not throwing a party.
All right? This is someone's idea of a joke.
It is? Yeah.
Too bad, 'cause that would have been great publicity for "The Spectator.
" Although it probably would have been impossible to find a caterer this last minute.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
You know what? Why not? It is a good idea.
All right, well, see what you can pull together, and, uh, I'll handle the caterer.
Guess what, boys and girls? Looks like school's back in session.
The question is, have you learned your lessons? Let's hope not, 'cause I'm in the mood to see someone fail.
Charlie? Rufus, hi.
Are you okay? What are you doing here? We were so worried about you.
Oh, no, I'm fine.
I'm totally fine.
I I probably should have called weeks ago, but, uh, is Lily here? She's, uh, on her way back from D.
C.
But I'm sure she'd love to see you.
Yeah, I'd love to see her, too.
I'm only in town for a few hours on my way to Europe.
I just wanted to explain to her in person why I left so abruptly.
Yeah.
So why did you leave so-- Oh, no, it's personal.
No offense.
It's just, I'd rather tell her on my own.
Well, you're welcome to stay and wait till she gets back.
Thanks.
And you know, I've been keeping up on what's been happening here since I left through Serena's blog and "Gossip Girl.
" I can't believe Blair went through with her marriage to Louis.
I really thought she was gonna end up with Chuck.
Yeah, between us, I think she may have wanted to.
Let's just say while love is a very complicated thing, so are prenups.
Speaking of love and prenups, uh, I have to go out and pick up a few more things for Lily for tonight.
Uh, so stick around.
She should be back soon.
See ya.
Thanks.
Thank you.
What are you doing here? I'm supposed to meet a lovely elderly woman who is going to tell me the joys of lifelong chastity, but apparently she's late.
What about you? I'm meeting my book agent, who's also late.
Serena, I'm sorry.
I should've-- Dan, please, we--we don't have to discuss this.
Let's just try to move past it, okay? - Okay.
Can I interest you both in a glass of Dom, on the house? It's a special Valentine's gift to all of our guests.
Sure.
I guess one glass wouldn't hurt.
It's not our fault our dates are late.
Step one is accomplished.
The thaw has begun.
Like beautiful Polish spring.
Now on to step two.
Really? She did? No, I totally understand.
No, all right.
Yeah.
Have a nice day, too.
What was that? That was the catering company.
I specifically asked for Lola, that girl from the wedding, but it turns out she has a note in her file that says she can't work any events at "The Spectator.
" What did you do to her, Nathaniel? Nothing.
I didn't do anything.
She was the reason I agreed to do the party in the first place.
Maybe I should just cancel the whole thing.
You're doing all this for a girl? If she won't work a party at "The Spectator," would she work one at the Empire? Not if she knew I was throwing it, apparently.
As much as I absolutely loathe this day, I can't deny my best friend a chance at true love.
I'll be overseeing the usual festivities downstairs in the bar, but I'll host your party up here, and I'll even call the catering company myself.
Really? You don't mind? Ohh.
That's great, man.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
We just wanted to tell you that we think you make a lovely couple.
Who? Who, us? Oh, no, no, no.
We're not.
Guess how many years we've been together.
Come on.
You're supposed to let them guess.
We were high school sweethearts.
Been together ever since.
Best 54 years of my life.
Sorry.
I-I don't think we ordered this.
This is also on the house, for all our guests.
I don't see any other tables here with this dessert.
And it's strange that neither one of our meetings showed up.
Okay, Alessandra said someone left her a voice mail, saying I was canceling.
Same with the virgin.
She called the office to reschedule.
Gee, I wonder who could be manipulative enough to call all these people and get away with it.
It's too bad it's not Valentine's Day more than once a year.
I could really make a serious go at this whole Cupid thing.

  Yes, "Operation
Darena" going very smooth.
Now that they're actually talking again, we just need to figure out a way to get them both to Nate's party tonight.
Once they see each other in their old uniforms, how could all those old feelings not come flooding back? It's true.
You never forget first love.
I remember mine.
Kazimierz.
Once, he took me out into sugar beet field Thank God.
Nate's party has been moved to the Empire.
I told Estee we'd stop by, but there's no way I can bring a royal minder to my ex's apartment.
Looks like you'll just have to wear a school uniform and play Cupid in my place.
Oh, no.
This is very bad plan.
Damn! Nate's party has been moved to a suite at the Empire.
So? So he lives with Chuck.
I highly doubt Blair's gonna risk running into her ex with a royal minder in tow, which means that when I drop my bomb, the person it would hurt the most won't even be there.
Damn! Oh, no.
This better not be someone telling me that Serena's bailing, too.
I hooked up a doorman at the Van Der Woodsens' with some free Knicks tickets a couple years ago.
Best decision I ever made.
I think he saw something that might be of interest to you.
Does she know that I'm gone? Okay.
Well, uh, tell her I'm running an errand, and I'll be back in a few hours.
Okay, thanks.
I'm sorry, but, um, no one's home right now.
Charlotte Rhodes.
I'm hurt.
You don't remember me? I met you last year at the Constance party when you were pretending to be mentally ill.
Although you're still hanging around here, so maybe you really are.
Right.
Georgina, is it? I gave you my number, but you never called, which is why when I heard you were back in town, I thought I'd come by and catch you in person, especially since you have a habit of bolting so quickly from places.
So What are you doing here? Just in town for a brief visit, that's all.
Anybody know you're back? Only Rufus and I'd appreciate it if it stayed that way.
No problem.
Just give me some gossip.
Or are you gossip enough? Look, Georgina, I just got here.
I don't know anything.
Aw.
Come on now.
You're part of the family.
You must know something.
All I know is that Blair and Louis signed sort of a prenup, but in this town, that's hardly news.
You know, you really should have called me.
We could've had a lot of fun.
Well, at least now I can.
Philip, find out who represents the Grimaldi family in New York and meet me there.
Oh, and we're probably gonna have to file for divorce.
Looks like Gossip Girl just got her first Valentine's Day gift.
Hey! How was your lunch with the vestal virgin? Helpful and informative or ghost of V-Day future? You can stop.
I know that you canceled my interview and set me up with Dan.
It was an act of goodwill.
Just because I can't have love in my own life doesn't mean I shouldn't bring it to the people who I care about most.
But Dan doesn't have feelings for me, and--and there's nothing that will change that, not some champagne or dazzling dessert.
Not even two fake old people in love? They weren't real? Actor's equity.
But you're wrong.
Do you know what Dan said to me this morning? Same thing you did.
His last good Valentine's Day was in high school with you.
I'm telling you, there's still a glimmer of hope there.
That's never gonna happen, but thank you for trying.
Wait, wait, wait.
Why don't you come with me and my new royal minder to the cardiac ball tonight? We can bond over our mutual broken hearts while looking at people with actual broken hearts.
Thank you.
I think I'll just stay home, eats lots of gelato, and write about how true love is nothing but a myth.
Hey, I was in the neighborhood, so I just wanted to stop by and tell you in person I'm not gonna be able to make it tonight.
Come on, man.
You, too? Chuck's gonna be working.
Blair and Serena are no-shows.
I mean, wh-what's up? You have a hot date or something? Oh, hardly.
Blair's trying to set me up with Serena, which reminded me, I didn't exactly have a great time in high school, so I'm not eager to relive it.
Before you say "no," think about this.
There's gonna be grown women here dressed like schoolgirls.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I-I can't make it.
If it makes you feel any better I will totally sign your yearbook.
No, it doesn't.
What is it? It's, um, something strange.
Of course I love you, Chuck.
I've always loved you.
I love you more and more every-- Um you know what? On second thought, I think I will come tonight.
I mean, who doesn't like schoolgirls? Yes! Hello? Have you heard from Lily? It's getting late, and I really need to catch my flight.
Charlie, I feel terrible.
Her train was delayed, so she's headed straight to, uh, the Empire.
I'm meeting her there now.
Can I swing by there on my way to the airport? Do you wanna just call her? No! It's really important.
Yeah.
O-okay, okay, I'll tell her you're on your way.
I know.
You're mad at me for trying to set you up with Serena.
Actually, not really.
We kinda had a nice time today, which got me to thinking that there may be hope for us yet.
I knew it.
I knew there was still something between you.
Now go ask her to Nate's party.
Oh.
"Guitar Hero" in one suite, a Sushi bar in the other.
Ah, a girl gets beaned with a Nairtini or someone uses a secret key to sneak into the pool.
It's just like old times.
That sounds romantic, but I was thinking it might be better to explore whatever future we might have without the--the pressure of a real date, you know? What do you mean? Well, you did such a good job playing Cupid at lunch that I thought you could do it again, so why don't you come with us? Mm.
I would love to help, but I've suddenly got this royal pain in the ass from Monaco who's watching my every move, so I don't think it's such a good idea for me to bring her to Chuck's.
No, what better place to bring her? You could finally prove that Chuck is no longer a threat, and Nate said he's probably not even gonna be there tonight.
Chuck won't be there? No.
Fine.
I'll make a swing by quickly on the way to the cardiac ball, but just to drop her and go, okay? Thanks.
I'll see you there.
I can't believe everything in Blair's prenup-- money, chateaus, portraits.
Real estate, yachts, jewels.
She owns half a museum? Pay dirt.
It says here Blair defaults on the marriage in any way, the Waldorf family will owe the royals so much money, they'll be bankrupt.
And this helps us how? We're going to show the world what Blair really thinks of her vows, and we're gonna use Dan to do it.
Look out, B.
You may be trying to play Cupid, but all the arrows are pointed right at you.
Okay, so please tell me again why we're here, why I'm dressed like this, and why you're not? You told me your last good Valentine's Day was in high school, and since taking you to an actual Constance/St.
Jude party felt wrong on too many levels, I'm taking you to the next best thing-- a simulation.
Yeah, but I feel strange, and people are looking at me.
Trust me, S.
I have a big surprise for you tonight.
Isn't this your ex-boyfriend Charles Bass' hotel? And we're coming here on Valentine's Day? I hardly think the royal family would-- Listen, Estee, we are simply dropping by so I can do one nice thing for a friend before heading to the cardiac ball.
Chuck Bass is not a threat, and I think it's important for the world to see Chuck, what are you doing here? Just leaving.
Enjoy your evening, ladies.
See that? We're friends now.
We've put it all behind us, so feel free to alert the media if you want.
Classy party, Blair.
Is this the type of dignified function I can be looking forward to attending with you in the future? Trust me, we'll be leaving momentarily.
Since Bass seems to be the issue here, why don't I keep my eye on him? Downstairs, with people not wearing plaid or eating jell-o.
Hey, don't give me that look.
You said you didn't wanna work a party at "The Spectator," so this isn't "The Spectator."
Wait, wait, wait.
Just hear me out, okay? I think I did a pretty good job of addressing your concerns.
I mean, we're not having some cheesy Valentine's date here, okay? You get to see my world up close, maybe change your mind about it, and you don't have to miss work if you don't want to.
Come on.
Just say a quick hello.
You have to.
Serena would kill me if she knew that I saw you and didn't drag you upstairs.
No, Dan, I told you, I really don't have time.
I need to go find Lily-- No, it's too late.
Too late.
Hey, look who I saw racing through the lobby as I was listening to St.
Vincent? Good-bye.
Charlie, what are you doing here? And where have you been for the past three months? I know.
I just felt really overwhelmed and guilty about The car accident, especially since Chuck and Blair were leaving my party when it happened.
So I went back to Florida.
But, uh, you know, honestly, I really shouldn't be here right now.
I came to apologize to your mom on my way to catching a flight.
Do you have her room? I'll text her.
Don't worry about it.
But first you have to tell me all about your past three months and--and what it's like living with Carol again.
Ooh.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Okay, okay.
What are you doing? Hold still.
Serena really digs that outsider thing.
So I'm helping.
B.
T.
W.
, this tie didn't work for you in high school, and it doesn't work now.
So here's what I'm thinking.
Take Serena somewhere quiet, like--I don't know-- Nate's room or something.
Wait a second.
I really don't think I can go through with this.
You're really nervous, which is cute.
It is like high school all over again.
Listen, you have nothing to worry about, Dan.
Serena already likes you.
You know that.
Look, I'm telling you, just be your charming, wonderful self like you've been with me all year.
You think I've been wonderful? Are you kidding me? Look at everything we've been through together.
You kept it a secret when I found out I was pregnant.
You shielded me from the world so I could deal with my paternity test, and you brought me to a priest in my darkest hour.
You wrote Louis' vows for him, and then you saved me from my own wedding.
Do I need to go on? No.
So If you're that guy with Serena, how could she not love you? You gonna make your move or what? I will be right back.
You really do.
I mean it.
Charlie, welcome back.
Serena, can we talk? Yeah, of course.
Promise to call me the moment you get back from Europe, okay? I will.
Promise.
Charlie! Hey! Ivy! Ivy! It's Charlotte Rhodes from Florida.
We took that acting class together.
Uh, yeah.
Charlotte.
Hi.
It's good to see you.
What are you doing here? I was about to ask you that same question.
So Dan is looking for you.
Blair, that's not funny.
I'm not joking.
That was my big surprise.
Unlike you, he thought your lunch date went great, and he wants to explore things further.
Now I'm leaving, so go find him and see what happens.
Go! Georgina.
You're Gossip Girl? What? No.
No, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Oh.
Uh, okay.
I'm not Gossip Girl.
I just I work for her, and believe me, the job is a lot harder than I thought.
Okay, look, your blackmailing days are over.
If you tell anyone that I leaked that video of Blair and Chuck at her wedding, then I'll tell everyone that you're Gossip Girl's henchman.
Don't you think you're overreacting here? I mean, I was just trying to help your relationship along by getting you to finally kiss Blair.
I couldn't handle the lack of action any longer.
All those endless pauses and pained stares.
So boring.
She wants you to kiss her, too.
The fact that you haven't just done it already would be shocking if you weren't, well, you.
Dan.
Georgina.
What is going on? Everything's fine.
Georgina was just leaving, weren't you? Yes, I was.
This party is so 2007 anyway.
What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be at some fancy gala? I still have this.
And I just need to know one thing.
I sent Serena to look for you.
Am I just setting her up for disappointment? Do you really want us to get back together? I just want you to be happy.
Tell me what would make you happy, Dan.
Hmm.
Wait.
Hey, Georgina! Sorry, S.
Looks like your seven minutes in heaven just turned into seven seconds from hell.
Charlie Trout.
Drinking by himself on Valentine's Day.
Look out.
Do I know you? Yeah.
Alessandra.
We met at Dan's book party.
I have a vague memory.
Well, it's a good thing I have a vivid one.
I'm here with a bunch of single girlfriends, and it is super depressing.
Buy me a drink.
Unless Forgive the drunken brazenness here, but what do you say we head off to your room and make the rest of this dreadful holiday go away together? Thanks But maybe last year.
Oh, my God.
What is wrong with me? I was trying to get you two back together.
I thought that's what you both wanted.
It's not my fault he kissed me.
Not your fault? What, you sound like you're still in high school.
Says the girl in the Constance uniform.
Did you not believe me that I didn't send that video in? Of course I believed you.
Okay, well, then what is it? What, you just wanna take away something that matters to me? Did you even care about Dan? B.
, how many times can we fight like this? Aren't you sick of it? They say people keep fighting about the same things until it breaks them apart.
You know what? Maybe we're there.
There you are.
We really have to go.
I couldn't agree more.
The last thing my mother ever wanted was for me to be an actress, let alone live in New York City, so I applied to Julliard behind her back.
Now, well, she thinks I'm busy rushing sororities in Michigan state, and I'm actually here, taking classes and going by "Lola.
" Hmm.
Just working jobs like this one to make ends meet.
But what about you? Are you acting out here? Yeah.
Yeah, kind of.
I mean, you know, I-I got cast in this one part, and it paid really well, but it took a lot longer than I expected, and it was way more complicated than I thought.
All right, has anyone ever told you two how much you guys look alike? I mean, you could almost be sisters.
My mom used to say the same thing.
You remember her, don't you? No.
No, not really.
And I didn't realize how late it was getting.
So I'm going to go.
You know, we should exchange numbers sometime.
Well, I'd say an apology is in order after all your "I'm not comfortable in your world" talk, because you totally knew someone at my party.
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.
I stand corrected.
But why was Ivy Dickens here anyway? Oh, she's my friend's cousin.
Her real name's Charlie Rhodes.
I'm sorry.
"Real name"? Yeah.
You didn't know? Apparently, her mom is a crazy woman down in Florida who made her go by the name "Ivy Dickens" growing up.
It must have been when you knew her, but after last spring when she moved here to live with her family, she had to go by her real name.
And that name is Charlie Rhodes? Yeah.
What? Dan, give it-- Give me one good reason why I shouldn't just smash this phone on the floor right now? Fine.
No problem.
I've already e-mailed myself the picture anyway.
Doesn't matter.
You can't do anything with it anyway, 'cause the second you do, we'll just out you as the "Gossip Girl" spy you are.
Ugh.
I'm not her spy, you idiot.
I am her.
Watching you and Blair squirm with unfulfilled desire is way more fun than any damage one picture could cause.
What does that mean? It means that the girl you love finally gave you a sign that she likes you back, and there's not a damn thing either of you can do about it without destroying not only Blair's marriage but her family's entire financial future.
Her family? I don't understand.
She didn't tell you about her prenup? If Blair defaults in her marriage in any way, the dowry she'd owe would bankrupt Eleanor.
And, sweetie, if Blair hated you for being poor before, imagine how much she'd hate you for making her poor, too.
I have something I think you'd like to see.
And in your bedroom, no less.
Has she no decency? Anyway, happy Valentine's Day.
Blair! Blair, wait a second.
Just give me one more minute, okay? Sorry.
Why didn't you tell me about the prenup? Is that why you went back with Louis? I just can't risk my family's future like that.
I have no choice but to stay trapped in my marriage for at least a year.
So your feelings for Louis Are all business.
How about your feelings for me? 'Cause that kiss-- it wasn't like last year.
You--you kissed me back.
I felt it.
Doesn't matter what you think you felt, because Serena's my best friend, and I would never do anything to hurt her.
I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
Have a happy Valentine's Day.
Amazing.
You got exactly what you wanted.
So what are you waiting for? Use it.
If I post this picture, Dan will out me.
And I'm not sure I'm willing to give up being Gossip Girl over one little kiss.
So what are we gonna do? Dan knows how Blair feels about him now, which means the more they can't, the more they'll want to.
It won't be long before they're doing far worse things than kissing.
Speaking of I'm kinda digging this whole high school look.
Oh, well, it is Valentine's Day, and you have been uncharacteristically helpful today.
Sure.
Why not? Oh, not it.
I know I promised you all I'd expose a giant secret today, and I didn't deliver, but isn't that what Valentine's Day is all about Hopes dashed? Feelings hurt? Relationships severed? It's a day filled with crushing disappointments.
I want you to know I'm interested in more than your body, Alessandra.
I'm interested in your work, too.
Tell me, what's it like being a book agent and working with my good friend Dan? Where it's easy to take advantage of the vulnerable and lonely.
While some continue to pine over those great unrequited loves.
Others can't help but feel like they somehow got totally screwed.
How was your aunt? Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish it.
Oh.
How is she doing? Is she okay? I'm worried there's not much time left.
She really cares about you.
Wouldn't stop talking about you while you were gone.
Mrs.
Rhodes is up right now if you'd like to talk to her.
And while it'd be nice to believe that most Valentine's Days end well, we all know they are far more likely to end in heartbreak.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here-- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I love you more and more every day, if it's even possible to love someone that much.
This was the only car with the keys in it.
It's fine.
Just go.
You--you just wanna take away something that matters to me? Did you even care about Dan? Yeah, I've been holed up, trying to figure out a concept for my new book.
And it's great that they gave me a deal for a second one, but that means I actually have to come up wi something to write about.
I have something I think you'd like to see.
Charlie Trout.
Do I know you? Yeah, Alessandra.
We met at Dan's book party.
What's it like being a book agent and working with my good friend Dan? If they ever found out the truth about the real Charlotte Rhodes, they would never forgive me.
Ivy! It's Charlotte Rhodes! From Florida.
We took that acting class together.
Uh, yeah.
Charlotte.
Why was Ivy Dickens here anyway? Oh, she's my friend's cousin.
Her real name's Charlie Rhodes.
I'm sorry.
Real name? I'm worried there's not much time left.
Mrs.
Rhodes is up right now if you'd like to talk to her.
You shouldn't have sent that video in to "Gossip Girl.
" I didn't do it.
Then who did? I'll never tell.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
February is the shortest month, but the bitter chill makes it feel the longest.
The smart ones, like me, escape to more tropical climates, while some of my Upper East Side friends use the time to hunker down and finish their work.
Others snuggle up in bed with their agendas to keep them warm.
And then there are the homes that feel even colder inside than it is out.
Hello? You did not have to buy me a gift.
I wanted to.
I hope you like it.
It's gorgeous.
It'll look even more gorgeous on you.
Lunch today so I can see it? Uh, I can't.
Dan's turning in his book proposal.
He's making a big deal about it, even getting it bound.
A messenger's picking it up at 11:00.
I have to read it before it goes off to Jonathan Karp.
So what about after you're done? Oh, okay.
Come by around 5:00? It's a date.
Dad, what are you doing here? It's so cold, I came to get my green down puffy jacket.
Which is here because Lily hates it, and she'd throw it out if she got her hands on it.
Well, you might wanna listen to a woman with taste.
That reminds me, how's everything going with Blair? That's a nice transition, but we haven't really spoken.
Uh, I've been busy with my book proposal, and she's busy with, uh, her princess stuff, so, you know.
No, I don't.
And you guys kissed.
Which is why it's better to stay clear of her.
Nothing good could come of us hanging out right now.
So if we're not gonna be more than friends, it's too hard to be just friends.
Is that your proposal? Oh, congratulations.
At least you're using your solo time to be productive.
Yeah, I actually feel really good about it.
Hey, would you mind waiting, uh, for the messenger to come pick this up? 'Cause Chuck invited me over, and I'm gonna stop by on my way to the library.
He's not still mad at you for running off with Blair at the wedding? Uh well, I guess neither of us is letting our feelings for Blair keep us down.
Speaking of down, lily was right.
That jacket is terrible.
Why does everybody hate this jacket? I told you that I'm sorry.
I-I don't know what came over me.
I'm not sure it even was me, because why would I ever kiss Humphrey? Oh, so that's your excuse-- multiple personality disorder? Or did an alien take over your body? I would never do anything to hurt you.
Too late.
Look, it was a mistake.
What do you want me to do? Self-flagellate? Wear a hair shirt? If you're referring to the hideous fur vest you wore yesterday, I'm the only one that suffered because I had to look at it.
Can you pass the salt, please? Mm, looks like we're all out.
I go get more.
And I'd like some more bacon.
Crisp, please.
Oh, why don't you just take mine? You don't seem to have a problem doing that.
How much longer can you go on?! Enough! I can't take this! - No, she didn't.
Oh, yes, she did.
Dorota, come on! Let us out, Dorota! You not coming out until you work this out! I don't care if it takes all day! Don't look at me.
She works for you.
I'm glad you called, Nate.
I'm glad you said yes.
So what have you been up to since the party? Oh, I'm supposed to be doing schoolwork, but I'm really just procrastinating.
You know, hanging out with friends and trying to get to know the city even better.
Oh, and, um I friended that girl Ivy-- um, Charlie-- on Facebook, but I never heard back from her.
Yeah, well, she's in Europe, so maybe that's why.
Did she go with friends or just by herself? I don't really know.
Do you not like her or something? No, no, I do.
I mean, she and I this thing.
It was nothing major.
But if you're asking, I thought you should know.
I'm trying to be honest.
Well, I appreciate that.
Honesty is hard to come by these days.
Not that I'm one to talk.
My mom doesn't even know I live here.
Oh, hey, that's my friend Dan's book.
Are you reading it? Oh, actually, I'm performing it at the Upright Citizens Brigade.
It's this improv group, and they have a book night where they read excerpts from current novels.
They're doing "Inside" tonight.
Let me guess.
The reading's just you guys mocking it, right? Pretty much.
But it's not bad for Dan.
He should come.
You can invite him yourself.
He's on his way up.
We're taking monkey for a walk.
I thought since he's the reason I'm saddled with the mutt, he can freeze his ass, too.
So you guys are okay.
Here's monkey's playdate now.
Good to see you, Humphrey.
Is it? Of course.
Losing Blair was tough on us both, but it's not your fault.
So you're not mad about what happened? Because she used you as her getaway driver? Humphrey, you two can play "Driving Miss Waldorf" as much as you want.
As for me, I'm not interested in mooning over the woman who broke my heart.
I'm a sadist, not a masochist.
I think you might be on to something there.
Aren't I always? As for monkey, I'm afraid he'll have to wait.
Nathaniel's new friend would like to speak with you about "Inside.
" I'll just put these away for now.
Espresso? Sure.
So what's this I hear about my book? Oh, Lola's performing it at a theater.
With the Upright Citizens Brigade.
Have you heard of them? This is ridiculous.
I'm married.
And I haven't seen Dan since Valentine's Day.
Which proves my point.
Whenever you have feelings for someone that you can't deal with, you avoid them.
I am not avoiding him.
If you don't remember, I have a royal minder who watches my every move.
Okay, well, then if you don't have feelings for him, then spending time with Dan shouldn't be a problem for him or you.
It isn't.
And I'll prove it to you.
How? By hanging out with him all day.
Why don't you come with me? I'm not spending the day with you and Dan.
And what would that prove anyway? That he and I are nothing more than old friends.
I'll point out the sadness of his hair, clothing, Brooklyn roots, and he will decry my constructive criticism as snobbery.
We'll share our views on recent French cinema.
And there will be no kissing! Open up! Everything fixed? Not even close.
It will be.
Now I have to gather up Dan's DVDs.
And you wait hear and tell Estee when she arrives that I'm with Dan-- my friend who I'm not avoiding because he's just my friend.
Send pics! I'm so psyched.
I read about the, uh, Bret Easton Ellis one a while back.
Yeah, he came by the rehearsal, which was really cool.
You should come.
I mean, I'm sure the other actors would love to meet you.
Wow.
That'd be-- that'd be great.
Um, I just have to make a phone call, but, uh, my phone is dead.
Can I use yours? Yeah, of course.
Thanks.
So what's next? The worldwide musical of your book? Uh, yeah, I was thinking mimes.
Mimes can be pretty cool.
Hey, Nate.
Is everything okay? Not really.
Don't hang up.
Lola? Look, I know you're using my name.
I just don't know why.
Are you in trouble? It's complicated.
But I swear, I am not doing anything to hurt you.
Well, then explain it to me.
I I can't.
Justjust let it go, Lola, please.
I'm sorry.
I think the police would be really interested in hearing about you.
You know, stealing someone's identity is a felony.
It's been so cold, I've just wanted to lay low, you know? So I just got off the phone with the director and I have to go in early.
Are you ready, Dan? Yeah.
Chuck, if you don't mind taking a rain check on our dog walk Not at all.
A cold walk with monkey or basking in the glow of your book success? No-brainer.
Call me.
I've been calling you for days.
Why haven't you called me back? I'm at a silent yoga retreat in upstate New York.
Ah, that's funny.
You and your daughter are both in New York.
No, she isn't.
She's in college.
Yeah.
Yeah, Julliard.
And apparently, one of her extracurricular activities is partying at Nate Archibald's.
Oh, and she goes by "Lola" now.
What? How could that happen? I don't know.
But you need to get her out of there before this whole scheme blows up in your face.
I have to go, but thank you for getting back to me.
Who was it? You haven't called the family, have you? I'm feeling so much better.
I don't want to worry them.
No, it was the pharmacy.
They forgot to deliver one of your medications.
Now let's get you back to bed.
Take this to Humphrey's agent.
Same address.
Careful, Lonely Boy.
Looks like someone is finding some cold comfort in some red-hot revenge.
I need a taxi to take me to the train station.
Thanks.
I'll be right back.
Is everything okay? I'm worried.
Miss Cece's having trouble breathing.
I think we need to get her to the hospital.
Okay.
Uh Then we need to go against her wishes and tell the rest of the family.
I know she'll be mad, but it's right thing to do.
They should be with her.
I'll make arrangements for her travel while you call your mom and aunt.
You know, I think it'd be best if you call them.
I get confused with all the medical terms.
All right.
What are you doing here now? I couldn't wait.
Oh, well, you're gonna have to.
I'm just about to read Dan's proposal so we can send it on to his editor.
You should send it now, because what I have in mind is going to take the whole afternoon.
Oh, that's, um, that's not how the process works.
It's Dan.
Everyone's going to love it.
I did read an earlier draft, and it was in excellent shape.
I'm sure all he's done is changed a few commas here and there.
I should, um-- lock the door? Already done.
Hold all my calls and messenger Dan's proposal on to Jonathan Karp.
So these people are all here to perform my book? Yeah.
Actually, there was a fight over who got to play Clair.
I won.
Knew which prop to bring.
Oh, this is our director, Connor.
Dan, hey, so glad that you could make it to rehearsal.
Is there anything I can do? Just be a good sport and get ready to be mocked.
Well, that's my entire life, so I think I can manage that.
Great.
So we're starting with the deb ball and the destruction of the gown scene, right? Yes, we're gonna start with that.
Did that actually happen? No, not really, although Charlie did steal Serena's deb gown once.
Oh.
So you're close with Charlie, too? Sort of.
We had--we had this thing.
We, uh, kissed.
Kind of.
Uh, it's weird I'm even saying that.
Jeez, that Charlie gets around.
Yeah.
Um, I'm just gonna take this, actually.
Nate? Hey, what's up? You tell me.
Didn't your phone die? I charged it.
If you wanted Charlie's number, you could've just asked.
Okay, you're using me to get to her.
Why? I have to go to rehearsal now, but Maybe if you came down here to get a bite to eat with me between now and the performance, we could talk about it then? All right.
See you then.
She's in--she's in a closed door meeting? All right, well, just tell Alessandra I called.
Thank you.
Humphrey! There you are.
What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Oh, well, I saw you on the "Gossip Girl" "Spotted" map, and I-I thought I'd come by and drop these DVDs off.
You looked me up on "Gossip Girl"? What's going on, Blair? What? Nothing.
Can't a friend stop by to hang out with another friend to do whatever it is we're doing here? We're not doing anything here.
You're gonna go home, and I'm busy.
And after what happened at Nate's, I think us being together is a recipe for disaster.
Don't be silly, Humphrey.
We can get past that and be friends, just like old times.
In fact, you know, let's take a photo of our friendship so we can remember this moment forever.
Hey! You in the hideous headband.
Come, take a picture! Smile! Oh! Serena should see how much fun we're having right now.
You know, that headband is giving me Hillary Clinton flashbacks.
The bad kind.
Oh, yeah.
I would never wear it myself.
I just have it on because I'm playing Clair.
Humphrey, these pathetic people are playing us? I mean, really? The look like they work in a thrift store.
Oh, it is so nice of you to stop by and have tea on your way back from your retreat.
I don't know how you stayed silent for that long.
I think I would probably burst.
It's challenging, but it really gives you a feeling of peace, especially because I miss Charlie so much.
Mmm.
We do, too.
Did she have fun while she was here? I heard Nate had a terrific Valentine's Day party.
Terrific for some.
Mm.
Uh, Serena and Blair are having some issues.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did Charlie seem okay? She mentioned that Nate might be dating someone.
Uh, yeah, I think a girl named Lola, but I don't really know what's gonna happen with that.
Blair's with Dan.
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
No, believe it or not, it's actually a good thing.
What, that they're together? Yeah, I know.
As crazy as it sounds, it's--it's her way of apologizing.
And if she's willing to put whatever happened between them in the past I don't know.
Maybe I should, too.
You know what? I'm gonna go down there and talk to her.
You two have fun.
So I know you didn't just come by for tea.
What's going on? Ah.
Saved by the bell.
Hello? She's right in here.
Darling? Darling? Please? Come with me to the hospital.
I'll just meet you there.
No, no, please.
Please stay with me.
You're the only person I feel safe with.
I-I won't leave you.
I promise.
Dr.
Glassman will meet us at the hospital.
Dr Glassman's coming here? Oh, no, dear.
There's a helicopter waiting for us at the East Hampton Airport to take us into the city.
The rest of the family will be at the hospital within the hour.
Clair's a dictator, and you don't even have a doorman.
For her, Brooklyn is just a place for her limo driver to pass through on her way to J.
F.
K.
Why do you care what she thinks? You don't have to stay, really.
Nonsense.
We're friends, and friends support each other.
Friends aren't afraid to be with each other or feel awkward together.
Do you want me to hold your hand for support? No.
All right, everybody, let's take five.
Do you, uh, do you need me right now? Please need me.
Yeah.
So in the scene where Clair kisses Dylan, is that, like, a passionate kiss or is it just a sweet one? I've got this one, Humphrey.
First off, if you had done your homework, you would know the answer.
I mean, even Gossip Girl knows that.
Who's Gossip Girl? I thought this theater company was professional.
Have you never heard of research? Log on and learn everything you need to know about me, stat.
But you can skip my entire freshman year of college.
Secondly, Clair would never kiss Dylan passionately ever.
If she had to kiss him at all, it would be perfunctory, like shaking someone's hand or petting a dog.
I-I don't understand.
It's because you're listening to the ramblings of a deranged person.
Blair, go home.
Are you intentionally being obtuse? I mean, a Clair-Dylan kiss would mean nothing.
Do you mind if I show her? Actually, I do.
It should look like this.
Hey, is everything okay? Humphrey, you weren't supposed to kiss back.
You ruined it.
Yeah, you're right.
This is my fault.
Hey, you guys know what happened to Serena? She just walked out of here all upset.
Oh, God.
She saw us kissing again.
Serena, wait! Look, it wasn't what it looked like.
Please, just stop.
Just even if it hurts me, be real with me for a second and tell me the truth, that you--that you like Dan.
I I don't.
I'm I'm married and I promised Chuck I'd wait for him.
And then there's the clause in the prenup.
Oh, come on.
We both know if you have feelings for someone, nothing else in the world matters.
That's not true.
We're not servants to our emotions.
We can control them, suppress them, stomp them out like bugs.
You know, I-I can't do this anymore.
I can't stand here and listen to you lie to me and--and lie to yourself.
I'm done.
Looks like S.
and B.
can't find any refuge from the nasty cold.
Hey, mom, can I call you back, please? Oh, my God.
You are trouble.
I take that as a compliment.
Oh.
Allow me.
Oh, my God.
You made me miss four calls from Jonathan Karp.
I wonder what's going on.
Yes, it's Alessandra for Jonathan.
They must've really loved Dan's proposal to call back this quickly.
Jonathan, hi.
Yes.
You read it? Didn't you love it? I mean, unexpected but it's Plagiarized? That's impossible.
You look like you have your hands full.
I'll just leave you with this.
I'm sure there must be some explanation.
Humphrey! Will you excuse us? No.
No, no, p-please don't go.
I'm in the middle of something here.
But Serena's mad at me because of the kiss, and I-I keep telling her it doesn't mean anything but-- That's enough, Blair.
It's enough.
Really.
Y-you can go if you want.
No, this is all great.
I can use this.
Or I can go.
I really need a friend right now.
I don't want to be your friend, Blair.
I want more.
I want you.
And if you don't feel the same way about me, then I don't think we should be seeing each other anymore.
I can't believe all the details Gossip Girl knows about your lives.
I know.
It's scary, right? So are you looking up Blair for your character or Charlie for your secret agenda? I'm--I'm sorry I've been so mysterious.
It's just this really weird situation, and I don't want to get you wrapped up in it.
Spotted--Charlie Rhodes entering the hospital.
Here's hoping it's for a checkup and not that she's being checked in.
Oh, my God.
Well, I guess I know where we're going.
Hey.
Can you tell Connor that I had to leave? Leave? Who'll play Clair? Hey! Hey, you.
You'd be amazing.
Mother should be here by now.
I'm gonna see if there's an update.
Okay, I'll just wait here, then.
Wait! Mom! Mom, is grandma okay? Yeah, I'm gonna check now.
Mother? Oh, my God.
Is she unconscious? Uh, no.
They just-- they have her sedated.
We--we think she has a blood clot in her lung.
It's very common with cancer and chemotherapy.
Chemo? She hasn't said a word.
I mean-- We have to get her a C.
A.
T.
scan immediately.
Her doctor's waiting for her inside.
Charlie, what are you doing here? I, um, I just went to visit grandma and, um Don't be so modest, Charlie.
She's been with Ms.
Rhodes for months.
She's been such a solace to her.
You've been taking care of her? Dr.
Glassman, what is-- what's going on? All right, well, uh, if it is a blood clot, then Cece will need emergency surgery to remove it.
So I need you to sign some papers immediately to approve the surgery.
Okay, I'll handle it.
I'll go with you.
What do you think you're doing? Look, I thought we were taking her to a hospital in the Hamptons.
Charlie, the doctor wants to talk to you, too, since you've been with her for the past few days.
This is not over.
Looks like the heat just got turned up on our Upper East Side's favorite impostor.
There you are.
I have been calling and calling.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I had my ringer off.
But I'm glad you got my e-mail to come tonight.
I had a bunch of books sent over to sell at the front of house.
I know the lingo.
Uh, but all the proceeds are going to U.
C.
B.
What did you think of my proposal? You mean the one you plagiarized? What are you talking about? The proposal you sent in was a condensed version of a book that was already published By Jonathan Karp.
"Blast Off" was the first book he ever edited.
Yeah, yeah.
I-I know that book.
It's about the first crew ever to go up in the space shuttle program.
But you know what my book is.
It's a--it's an alternative history of Manhattan as a--as a monarchy.
That's not the one you sent in.
Maybe you read someone else's proposal.
Yeah, I may not have technically read it.
Mm, I mean, your first draft was so good.
So Okay, but I triple-checked with the messenger company.
It came from you.
And if we can't show them this is a horrible mistake, they're talking about dropping you.
What? Why? Dan, plagiarism is a serious offense.
Okay, let me check my computer and just make sure that you got the right one, and we'll make this go away.
House opens in five.
I have been looking for you everywhere.
I was just trying to stay out of the way, give you and the family some space.
Which makes sense since you're not family.
You were supposed to disappear months ago.
And I meant to.
But you realized my mother was an easy target? No! Look, Cece had been so kind to me.
I just wanted to thank her, and when I saw her, I realized she was sick.
My grandmother died of cancer, and I saw the signs-- I don't wanna hear your sob story.
Well, I can't leave now.
I promised Cece I would stay.
Besides, what would everyone think? Well, you better hope that they don't.
I don't understand.
It's--it's gone.
But you backed it up, right? No! Dan, is this some sort of cry for help? You can tell me.
No, I swear to you, I do not know what's going on.
Maybe--maybe the messenger screwed up.
Maybe someone's screwing with me.
Who would go to such lengths to do this to you? That's a nice scarf.
Thanks.
It's a Shahtoosh.
It was a present.
Oh.
I'm gonna go back to the office and try to convince Karp this was a mistake or a practical joke.
You go home and rewrite yours as fast as you can.
Mm-hmm.
When did you forget who you are? You wanted to be the most powerful woman in America.
"Not just America.
" Really? Only there's nothing powerful about you right now.
Ugh.
You always get this way when you're around Charlie Trout.
I don't know who I am without him, Sabrina.
You guys are doing a really good job here, making fun of this.
Look, I-I get it.
I do.
You're afraid of what people might think if you change your mind, but you can't care about them.
You never used to.
You're Clair Carlyle.
You're in control of your own destiny, and most of Manhattan's.
How did you get so smart? Can't take the credit.
It's Dylan.
Dylan? We might be best friends, but Dylan and you have something that even you and I don't have.
Remember when you won that essay competition, and your mother was too busy to even show up to watch you get your award? Who came, even though you treated him so terribly? Dan came to that? Uh See, Dylan's always here for you, even when you don't even know it.
No matter how you treat him, he cares about you, not in spite of who you are, but because of it.
Dan loves me for me.
Uh Yes, Dylan does.
Oh, my gosh.
I-I've gotta go right now.
You know what? That's-- that's not your line.
No, me.
I, Blair, have to go.
Any updates? Ah.
God.
Well, they're prepping her for surgery.
Apparently, her cancer, which we didn't know had returned, was responding well to chemo, but then this--is just such a nightmare.
Mom? What are you doing here? I'm sorry.
Who are you looking for? Wait.
Lola? You know her? Mom, what's going on? Carol, what is this girl talking about? Do you know her? Yes.
Yes.
She's, uh my daughter.
What? Well, then who are you? Uh-oh, Ivy.
Do you feel the chill permeating the air? That's the Upper East Side turning their backs on you and tossing you out into the cold.
Carol, I don't understand.
Why did you introduce this girl as your daughter? Who is she? Ivy Dickens.
Yeah.
We--we know that story.
Oh, my God.
So Max was telling the truth.
Ivy, don't say a word.
Your mom hired me to be you.
Why would you do that? To protect you.
I was supposed to gain access to your trust fund for your mother, which I did, and then I went back to my own life, then I ran into you in L.
A Oh, so then you came back to New York with me.
Yeah.
So when my private investigator found Lola, it was the real Charlotte Rhodes.
So you did all of this for money? You hid an entire family from me for money? You don't know these people, what they're capable of.
I-I spent my entire life running from them for you.
Yes, running from people who would take in your fake daughter as our own.
We must be monsters.
Lily, Rufus, and Serena, I understand that you're mad.
Look, I'm sorry.
Charlie don't.
Why would you do this to me? I don't know what you're talking about.
You switched the proposal.
When I saw the Shahtoosh scarf on Alessandra, I knew.
I thought that was a nice touch.
I'm impressed you know the value of quality.
You've learned so much from me in such a short period of time.
Mm, you wanted me to know it was you.
You can't prove anything.
I can't, but when Jonathan Karp sees my real proposal Would that be before or after "Page Six" exposes Dan Humphrey for the plagiarist he is? Whether it's true or not, you will be tainted, and your publisher will drop you for good.
You see, you can't win against me, Humphrey.
You can't even compete.
So this is about Blair.
Well, then I guess I'm not competing.
I must be winning.
You wouldn't be trying this hard if I didn't have a real shot with her.
And up until this moment, I wasn't sure if I did.
So thank you.
Now, uh, if you'll excuse me, I, uh, I have better things to do.
Why did you come back to New York with me? You didn't have to.
And as I remember it, you didn't even want to.
I never really had a family.
You were so good to me, like a big sister I never had.
I really care about you guys.
Oh, you care about us or the money? I suppose it was your idea to keep my grandma's relapse a secret so you could be the only one there for her when no one else was.
Look, I begged her to call you.
She just didn't wanna worry you guys.
You know what? This is a family matter, okay? So you need to leave now.
No, I promised Cece that I would stay with her.
I'm not leaving.
You're nothing to her-- a stranger, a nobody, so get outta here before I call the cops.
Charlie! I go by "Lola" now.
"Lola"? I guess there have been a few things you've been hiding from me as well.
Not an entire family.
My whole life, you told me it was just us.
What is so terrible about those people that you didn't want me to know them? Or is it that you didn't think I deserved to know them? Of course not.
I love you! Everything Everything I have done is to protect you, to--to protect us.
After today, there is no us.
I don't want anything to do with you.
You don't mean that.
I do.
The most painful rejection always comes from those you love the most Bye, mother.
And that one has to hurt.
Thank you for telling me about Cece.
I'm a little afraid to go in.
Serena's so mad.
Serena doesn't have anything to be mad about.
You said so yourself.
Well, maybe she does.
Maybe she was right.
About what? About me denying that I had feelings for you.
I came to see you today to prove that I'm not in denial.
One of my specialties-- warped logic.
It is a unique skill you have.
It's awful.
No, it's not awful.
It's you.
It couldn't be awful.
Humphrey How can this happen? The prenup and Chuck, Serena.
Well, whatever this is, it will have to wait.
What if I don't want to? I'm gonna go head in and see my dad.
So it seems you were right.
I do have feelings for Dan.
I'm sorry.
You don't have to be.
But I won't see him.
Not because I'm in denial, but because I care too much about your friendship.
You come first.
You're my family.
Look, this isn't gonna be easy for me, but at least you're being honest.
And if our friendship is real, which I know it is, then we can get through this.
You two are gonna face a lot of obstacles, but I'm not gonna be one of 'em.
I don't wanna get in the way of you and Dan.
I'm really glad you're here, though.
I need you.
Hey.
Hey.
So I guess we're cousins.
I guess so.
Look, if you ever wanna get coffee or something, I'd love to get to know you.
Yeah.
Um Up until ten minutes ago, I didn't even know I had a family, so Forgive me if I'm not really interested in "coffee or something.
" What do you mean that cater girl is your cousin? Oh, there's a lot going on here.
You ready to face the mayhem? I need to make a phone call first.
Okay.
Chuck, stop trying to hurt Dan.
If you wanna be mad at anybody, be mad at me.
I could never be mad at you.
It's nice to hear you say that, really, but being a good person isn't just being good to me.
Dan has done nothing to you but be a friend.
You made it seem like you wanted me to wait for you.
Was that a lie? No.
Did your feelings change? No.
I don't know.
But whatever happens, don't punish Dan for my confusion.
I-I need some time to figure some things out, and if you target him, then it'll just push us closer together, and I know you're too smart for that.
You're better than that, so please.
Blair, don't I-I gotta go.
As we wait for spring to come, we desperately look for the signs that the harsh winter is coming to an end.
Hello? I'm about to send you something.
Check your e-mail.
And the signs are clear-- a ray of sunlight that cuts through the darkness.
Thanks for waiting for me.
Of course.
Did you find Charlie? Yeah.
Are you okay? I don't know.
Um I just really have to get out of here.
Oh, well, let me get you home.
I don't really wanna be alone.
Can I stay with you? Yeah.
The bud of a new relationship popping through the frosty ground.
Hey, Alessandra just called.
Chuck sent over my real proposal.
Really? Yeah, she thinks she can salvage this.
That's great, Dan.
Yeah, wonder what made him change his mind.
I'm gonna head home.
Want anything? I'm okay.
Thank you.
I'm gonna stay.
Serena needs me.
A sudden spike in temperatures But don't you forget, Upper East Siders, February isn't the end of winter in this town.
There's still a long way to go.
Turns out tropical islands are boring, and the lack of scandal is getting to me.
So I've decided to turn up the heat from afar.
I have a certain e-mail from Lonely Boy that will make Chuck Bass' blood boil.
Of course I love you, Chuck.
I've always loved you.
I love you more and more every day, if it's even possible to love someone that much.
Humphrey, you b*st*rd.
But if you think winter's over, think again.
There's sure to be another cold snap and sadly, some won't survive the winter.
I don't have good news.
Cece had a stroke as we were prepping her for surgery.
There's nothing we can do.
You need to go in and say your good-byes.
So come out of the cold, my Upper East Siders and into the cozy warmth of my home.
My doors are always open.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here-- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
You shouldn't have sent that video in to "Gossip Girl.
" I didn't do it.
If you didn't do it and I didn't, then who did? Of course I love you, Chuck.
I've always loved you.
Humphrey, you b*st*rd.
You and your family will quite literally pay the consequences.
Or did you forget about the dowry? If she defaults on the marriage, the dowry can be reinstated.
You do not have to go with them.
It's just a year.
It's not that long, right? This is Estee, A.
K.
A.
, my royal minder, but I've just been calling her "Creeper" for short.
I do have feelings for Dan.
I'm sorry.
This isn't gonna be easy for me, but at least you're being honest.
I don't want to get in the way of you and Dan.
I think we need to get her to the hospital.
Please stay with me.
You're the only person I feel safe with.
I won't leave you.
I promise.
Oh! Mother? Charlie, what are you doing here? She's been with Ms.
Rhodes for months.
She's been such a solace to her.
Mom? Why did you introduce this girl as your daughter? Who is she? Ivy Dickens.
Your mom hired me to be you.
You hid an entire family from me for money? I don't really wanna be alone.
Can I stay with you? There's nothing we can do.
You need to go in and say your good-byes.
They say we should carry our secrets to the grave.
But on the Upper East Side, secrets are the one thing you can never bury.
Even when we think we know everything about the ones we love, there's always a skeleton in their walk-in closet.
Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
Mrs.
Humphrey, in my business, there's rarely advance warning.
Oh, of course.
I just wanted to make sure all of mother's funeral arrangements were perfect.
She was very particular, liked things a certain way.
Um, would it be possible for us to work with our own florist? Oh.
I'm sorry.
I thought you knew.
Your mother provided very detailed instructions.
In fact, if you return home right about now, I think you'll discover the wake is already underway.
Well, I can hear my mother laughing from beyond the grave.
I'm sure she just didn't want to bother you with making all the arrangements.
Or she just didn't trust your taste level.
Oh.
I'm the other daughter, Carol.
Crashing as usual.
Well, since you're here, you might want to know that it seems mother took care of everything in advance.
I'd tell you to invite your daughter-- the real one, not the fake one-- but she's not speaking to you.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I apparently have a wake to host.
Aren't you gonna be late for work? Or you pulling a "Vanilla Sky" and hiding your hideous disfigurement from your global publishing empire? What? I thought you found my lacrosse injury sexy.
No? Besides, I figured we could spend the day together and catch up.
Uh-oh.
No.
No.
Don't give me that "Let's talk about our feelings" face.
What? This is normal face.
Okay? No, I'm worried about you.
In the past 72 hours, you found out that you have this entire secret family.
Yeah, and my mom hired an actress I know to play me.
I'm aware.
Then why haven't you said a word about it? I may not have known about the Van Der Woodsens for the last 19 years, but they sure knew about me.
And they didn't care, so that pretty much tells me everything I need to know about your fancy friends from the Upper East Side.
Now buy a girl some breakfast? All right.
Two minutes.
Get dressed.
I'll make coffee.
Hey.
How you holding up? Well, the past few days have been tough on everyone.
But I-I have a question.
Are you with Lola? She hasn't been answering any of my calls or texts.
Ahh.
Yeah.
She's Not really that interested in being a Rhodes right now.
Well, trust me, I know what it's like to want distance from your family more than anyone.
But I thought maybe with Cece's death, she'd make an exception.
Well, I'm not so sure.
The entire Van Der Woodsen clan on a good day can be pretty overwhelming.
Well, I have an idea.
Maybe you know, maybe she can just dip her toes in the water with just me? I'm at my mom's right now.
No one else is here.
They'll be at the funeral home for a while.
Maybe the three of us can meet up.
I mean, I'll ask her.
I just can't promise you anything.
Thank you, Nate.
Coffee? Top drawer.
It relaxes me to watch Anita Dust.
I did not need to know that.
What's got you in such a good mood? I recently found out who actually sent "Gossip Girl" the now-infamous video of me and Blair at the royal wedding-- that hump, Humphrey.
What, Dan? He was only too happy to let Serena and me take the fall so he could worm his way into Blair's broken heart.
Unfortunately for him, when she finds out the truth, his chances with her will be destroyed, and she will be mine again.
I don't know, Chuck.
Are you sure you want to start World War Waldorf right now? Why wouldn't I? 'Cause you and I both know that nothing can actually happen between Dan and Blair for at least a year.
So a lot can change in 12 months.
Take the high road.
Grab your coat.
I'm kidnapping you and taking you to a bona fide Humphrey brunch.
Psst! Ah.
Bien sur.
Merci.
Nous parlerons demain.
So for those of us who took Italian, what was that all about? That was Cyrus and another attorney at his firm.
They think they may have found a loophole in my prenup.
Are you serious? Yes.
Apparently, since we signed it in Monaco but got married in the U.
S.
-- You can contest it.
Oh, we can try.
Cyrus thinks the Grimaldis may have to grant me an amicable annulment, meaning that they'd waive my dowry And you wouldn't have to wait the year for Anything.
When will Cyrus know for sure? Well, he's supposed to talk to the Grimaldis' royal attorney in an hour, so rain check on that waffle? I should wait here Hopefully for the last time.
No.
Delete.
Delete.
What are you doing? Trying to help.
No, you're not.
If you were, you wouldn't let me slave in front of this computer all day as Gossip Girl.
Well, I thought you said knowing everyone's secrets as Gossip Girl was your dream come true.
It was, until I realized how much work it is.
I mean, look at me.
I'm exhausted and aggravated.
I have no social life to speak of.
I feel like a stay-at-home mom.
Oh, honey, don't say that.
It's true.
I mean, all my life I've been the one that they write stories about, and now I'm just another anonymous shut-in with an online shopping addiction.
Tell me, what can I do? Well Since you asked, Georgina Sparks needs a recharge, so I've decided to take a mental health day, and I've found the perfect event to crash-- Cece Rhodes' secret wake.
What about "Gossip Girl"? The site can't go down all day.
It won't.
That's why I'm leaving you in charge.
Don't worry.
It's not rocket science.
You just take the tips that people send in and post them if they're worthy.
Are you sure this is such a good idea? Aw, what's a Van Der Woodsen family event if I'm not there to ruin it? Besides, I already promised a new friend I'd be her plus one.
Thank you for coming with me.
I know I was invited, but, uh, I don't think I could face them all alone.
I understand.
When everybody at a party hates you, who better to bring than someone they hate even more? What are you doing down here? I thought there was a family breakfast this morning.
Oh, there's a lot more than that going on upstairs.
I just came down to warn my mom.
You'll see for yourself.
Is Blair's houseboy up there? You mean Dan? Is that why you came by-- to get intel on him and Blair, torture him a little? Maybe just a little.
Well, he's not here.
At least, not yet.
But, um, here's some intel for you.
Blair just texted me that Cyrus may have found a loophole in her prenup, so she may be released sooner than any of us thought.
And right into Dan's waiting arms.
If you'll excuse me.
So what do you wanna do for breakfast? Oh, I was thinking Untitled at the Whitney-- Danny Meyer's new place? Oh, you're trying to score a cool point, aren't you? And since we'll be on Madison anyway Oh, here it comes.
Well, we'll be walking right by Serena's mom's, which Serena will be at by herself, I might add.
Nate, what part of wanting nothing to do with the Van Der Woodsens don't you understand? Look, I know how you feel about them, but not everything from the Upper East Side is automatically bad.
Okay.
Name one thing that isn't.
Me.
Come on.
Serena's one of my best friends, okay? You haven't even given her one shot.
What's the harm? All right, but if we stop by, you have to promise me that you're never gonna play me like this again, okay? I promise.
Mom, you knew grandma always did like to do things her own way.
I know.
I'm just not entirely sure I'm in the mood for the "Mayflower" mausoleum in mother's honor that obviously awaits us upstairs.
Oh, my God.
It was all here when I got home.
There's whiskey and stew And mother.
And those are our mourners' chairs where we will sit and mourn because this is an Irish wake.
Looks like this wake might end up being the wake-up call you so desperately need.
Copy Paste Post.
Oh, no.
Oh, crap.
I just can't believe that this was mother's idea.
And who are these people? I don't recognize a soul.
Well, I guess Cece wanted us to celebrate her life and not mourn her death, so she didn't invite any of her stodgy socialites, just the the help.
That--that--that was her butcher from East Hampton, and her driver.
And the fireman that saved her life the night she left the candle burning.
Hi.
You.
What are you doing here? I was invited by your mother herself.
I promised her I'd come.
I just came to pay my respects.
I won't bother anybody.
This is all Carol's fault.
Yeah, I'm sure she's hiding here somewhere.
You can't let Carol get to you like this.
The executor of the estate is supposed to be coming, whoever that is.
My money is on Elias the gardener.
And I'm sure everything will be explained once they read the will.
Well, whoever it is, they'd better get here soon, because I'm not responsible for what I might do.
So Serena's here alone, huh? I swear I had no idea what we were walking into.
So this is an epic fail.
Yeah, let's just go, before someone sees us.
Lola.
May I have a word? Of course this is happening.
What is it, mother? Do you mind telling me what you're doing here? Oh, yeah, well, let's see.
Um, this morning, while I was in the shower at Nate's, Serena, the cousin I just found out about, tricked me into coming to the wake of the grandmother that I never knew existed at the house of the family that you hid from me for my entire life.
Does that sum it up for you enough? I know you blame me for everything, but I only lied to you because we're not safe around these people.
They're materialistic monsters.
Oh, says the woman who looted her own daughter's trust fund.
That money was for you.
You cannot believe a word these people say.
Mom, the only person here who's ever lied to me is you.
Hey.
I know this place is crazy, but I'm really glad you came.
I was just about to call you.
I know.
I screwed up.
Yes, you did.
Who knows if anyone will send in another tip ever? Luckily for you, I'm in the eye of the hurricane.
So I can watch your mess play out, and if this is my last day as Gossip Girl thanks to you, I'm going out with a bang.
Dan, I'm so sorry for your loss.
Hey, Dennis.
Georgina, I would ask you what you're doing here if I cared, which I don't, so I was just wondering if you had the chance to check "Gossip Girl" recently.
No.
Why? I know I promised I'd never publicly reveal that little video secret of yours, but unfortunately, I left Philip in charge.
So lesson learned.
Okay.
Bye.
Oh, "G.
G.
--It's time you told everyone Dan Humphrey sent in that video on Blair's wedding day.
" Philip is rich, not bright.
I'm sorry, but keep reading.
Oh, my God.
This was-- this was sent in by How dare you? Of all your many, many attempts at sabotage, this is by far the most pathetic.
Are you so worried that I'll find happiness without you that you feel the need to spread baseless lies at the wake of my best friend's grandmother? While you may be correct about my motives, the blast is anything but a lie.
You know Serena and I didn't send the video, and it certainly wasn't Louis, so who's left? I'm not playing this game.
Why don't you tell that to your boyfriend over there? Or even better, ask him the truth.
Blair, please wait.
I have nothing to say to you.
I am so sorry I lied.
You didn't just lie, Humphrey.
You let me blame my best friend and my ex for something they didn't do.
You embarrassed me in front of You made me the target of tabloids and T.
S.
A.
agents, not to mention, you helped lock the bars of my gilded cage.
Am I forgetting anything? I should have told you the truth right away, but I swear, I never meant to hurt you.
Then what other reason could you have had to send in that video? I spent every day leading up to the wedding listening to you say you had to marry Louis even though you didn't love him.
I couldn't stand to see you so unhappy.
I only thought it would stop the wedding.
I never thought you would leave it with me.
And us fighting like this is exactly what that Bass-face wanted.
But since Cyrus thinks everything will work out with the annulment What can I do? Is there anything? Just say the word, and I will-- Just shut up, Humphrey.
I forgive you for now.
Estee? Did you follow me? I thought we weren't meeting till 4:00.
Yes, after Cyrus tried to trick the royal attorney into voiding your prenup.
I know everything.
Uh follow me.
Looks like Blair's annulment just got annulled.
Shame.
You were so close, too.
Let me assure you, your stepfather's plan will never work.
You slimy little limey.
I do not respond well to threats, and neither does Cyrus Rose.
He fought in 'Nam.
You didn't let me finish.
His plan might not work, but mine can.
We can help each other, you and I.
Go on.
You don't want Louis.
That's clear.
But I do.
The prince and I we're very close.
We grew up together, but my station always prevented me from being a suitable choice for Her Serene Highness, at least-- Until I came along.
Precisely.
You're a public relations disaster.
Next to your Sarah Ferguson's swan dive, I'm Kate bloody Middleton.
So you think the Grimaldis will welcome Louis' loyal-and-loving social secretary as a replacement? I know Louis would.
Sorry.
No, no, it's fine.
Oddly enough, I just want him to be happy.
Then this is worth a shot, isn't it? You have nothing to lose.
Make the call.
So that's the tour.
Thank you for coming by, or at least letting me trick you into coming by.
I assure you, Nate had no idea.
Well, actually, he said we were going to a museum, so he wasn't that far off.
Look, I know what your mom thinks about us, you know, how all we care about is money-- and the things you can buy.
But that couldn't be further from the truth.
Family is what's most important to us, and to prove that to you, I have two people who are gonna be so excited to see you.
Mom-- - You told me mother sold the Limoges, and don't think I didn't notice her Georg Jensen service here, either.
Tell Laryssa to count the silver right away.
I really appreciate everything you're trying to do, but, um I'm just not part of this world, and I don't really think I wanna be, either, so just tell Nate I had to go.
Oh, Lola.
I wasn't expecting to see you here.
Why? Even if I don't wanna be here, I have more of a reason than you do.
Look, I know this sounds ridiculous, but the Van Der Woodsens are the closest thing I have to an actual family.
Even though they hate me.
Yeah, I have the opposite problem.
Maybe my mother really was trying to protect me.
By stealing all your money? Ladies On the Upper East Side, money is never the real story.
It's usually just the "X" that marks the spot for what's buried beneath it.
If I were you two, I'd start digging.
What do you mean? I know it's hard for you, but stop and think.
Money doesn't explain why you hide your daughter for 18 years, unless she was being paid to do so, and judging by her hair and her clothes, I'd say that isn't so.
You think there's something else going on? How do I find out? Well, nobody here is going to tell you.
You have to find someone from the outside, somebody who isn't afraid of them.
Somebody like Dad.
Looks like there's a doctor in the house who's about to get a taste of his own medicine.
I'm so happy you're here.
It would have meant so much to grandma.
I wouldn't miss this for the world.
I'm just sorry that Eric couldn't make it back from Zaire.
I think they call that the Democratic Republic of Congo now.
They do, but trust me, it's not.
Charlie, good to see you again.
Oh, you're a little late to the party, doctor.
That isn't your niece, but this is.
Sorry? What are you even doing here? Come on.
Let's go say hi to mom.
Daddy V-D-Dubs has known the Rhodes sisters since high school.
I bet he has a secret or two he'd be willing to share if you ask nicely.
Hey, Serena said you left, but here you are with Ivy.
Hi, Nate.
I don't know why you're here, but we should probably leave since Lola and I were just walking out-- No, I'm gonna stay, and so is she.
We're gonna get to the bottom of why my mom really kept me away all these years, so, um, if you don't mind Oui.
Oui.
Naturellement.
Well? He agreed.
I need to be on the next plane back.
I'm to be amongst the royal court tomorrow when the prince breaks the news in a press conference about how it became clear you were only ever after his title.
But, uh-- Okay.
Okay.
What else? Then the royal family's publicist will start to build me up, the woman who has watched from the wings for decades.
Okay, enough about you.
More about me.
Her serene highness and the prince are only willing to annul the marriage if you agree to a gag order on all matters regarding the dissolution.
They can be the only ones to speak about it publicly.
Do you understand what that means? Well, I'll do whatever they say, as long as it gets me out of this marriage.
A press blackout is a small price to pay to get my life back.
That includes no more blind items on "Page Six" or posts on "Gossip Girl.
" Princess Sophie was very clear if you don't adhere to the deal, they'll make you pay.
Do whatever you want in your private life.
Just keep it private.
Good luck.
I'm glad we can both get what we want.
And please assure the royals when you see them that they won't hear a peep from me.
Beer me.
Perhaps you'd prefer something a little stronger.
It's green.
What are you so relaxed about? We both know that Gossip Girl's latest hiccup makes you look even worse in Blair's eyes.
Maybe today, but at least she knows Dan isn't the good guy he pretends to be.
In time, that'll sink in.
She's not getting out of this royal mess anytime soon.
Oh, but she just did.
That royal minder lady brokered the deal herself.
Although the hint of a new scandal could probably derail it if you act fast enough.
Blair will come to her senses.
What if she doesn't? What if you spend the rest of your days wondering why you didn't try and stop her from falling into the flannelled arms of that pretentious poseur? Anywho, something to think about.
What do you have in mind? Remember when I showed you this? How can I trust Gossip Girl wouldn't leave my fingerprints on another blast? You can't, which is why we use her latest screwup to our advantage and leave somebody else's instead.
Oh, look.
Dan's phone.
It must have fallen out of his coat and into my purse.
I'm sorry, Carol, but I'm gonna have to ask you to let me search your bag.
Laryssa saw you pocket-- Lily, this is beneath even you.
I see some things never change-- the maid accusing my ex sister-in-law of stealing.
William, what a lovely surprise.
Hello, dear.
Doesn't dad look great? And how are you, Carol? Under surveillance.
Lily has been shadowing me all afternoon.
That's because I knew you'd try to steal something, and apparently you did.
Do you see what I have to deal with, while my own mother lies right here? All right, Carol, I've had enough.
I want you out of my apartment this minute.
Technically, it's Cece's apartment.
What are you talking about? This is our home.
Only because your mother bought it for us.
Remember? For tax purposes, of course.
But now it's part of the estate.
William, thank you again for coming.
And I would appreciate it if you would leave the settling of mother's affairs to the executor of her estate.
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I am her executor.
And I brought her will.
Ladies, I know this must come as a shock, but as you well know, your mother and I had a long and enduring friendship.
It's just, of all the people for Cece to pick, I find it curious that she chooses the father of Lily's children.
Well, she couldn't very well have asked the father of yours.
There aren't enough D.
N.
A.
tests in Dade County to find him.
I think I'll let you two blow off some steam.
If you'll excuse me.
Hi again.
I'm Lola, Carol's daughter.
The real one.
What can I do for you? Well, I just recently found out that I'm a part of this family, and I was wondering why I was never allowed to know.
So I thought, you know, you've known my mom longer than anyone aside from Lily-- Excuse me.
Mom, do you mind? Yes, actually, I do.
You'll let me know when you need me, won't you, William? Miss Blair, I'm so sorry, but Ms.
Estee jedi-mind-tricked me into telling her you at wake.
Too many secrets lately.
I-I feel like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.
Oh, it's fine.
I'm glad Estee found me.
Everything's gonna work out perfectly now.
That's not what Mr.
Cyrus say.
He's been trying to call you for last hour.
Why you no answer phone? I put it on silent.
I'm at a wake.
And you can tell Cyrus he doesn't need to worry.
I took care of the annulment myself.
Then why Grimaldis just call him and ask for all the money now? Well, they agreed to waive the dowry as long as I completely stayed out of the press.
Maybe princess Sophie read "Gossip Girl" again, then.
"Please post A.
S.
A.
P.
Dan.
" "I, Celia Catherine Rhodes, of Montecito, California, "being of sound mind and body, "do hereby declare this to be my last will and testament.
"First, I leave my two Andalusian thoroughbreds, "Rickey and Reggie Rhodes, to the Valley Ranch stables. Second, I leave my Faberge egg collection--"
Hey, dad, wait a second.
Sorry.
I just--I don't want her here for this.
Is she bothering you? She's a con artist, William.
And not a very good one.
Nevertheless, your mother invited her to be here, so I would like everybody to respect Cece's wishes, okay? Please.
Now if there are no more interruptions I think you dropped something.
What Are you insane? Blair's gonna think I actually sent this picture in to "Gossip Girl.
" Duh.
That was the point.
We had a deal, Georgina.
You promised to protect me if I didn't tell anyone you were Gossip Girl.
Mm-hmm.
I sold you out, so start talking.
Look, I had fun being Gossip Girl, but I'm kind of over it.
I'm just glad that the final blast was my masterpiece.
I'm sorry if it ruins your life.
It's not just mine.
It's Blair's, the Waldorfs'.
Oh.
I know.
What a mess.
It's like I just took down the entire Upper East Side.
Oh.
Here comes the bull's-eye.
You Brooklyn Benedict Arnold, I can't believe you.
It was Georgina.
She's Gossip Girl.
Oh, you will really say anything, won't you? Oh, no, that part's true.
Well, half true.
I hacked into G.
G.
's web site a few months ago when she obviously skipped town and none of you noticed, and honestly, guys, the experience has been wonderful, but it's just as well it's over now.
Okay, could you--could you tell her the important part? I didn't do this.
How does it feel to be set up and lose the person you love for something you didn't do? Estee! Please.
There must be a way to still salvage our deal with the Grimaldis.
There might be if there ever was a deal.
I'm sorry? Oh? The deal thing? Estee made it all up with my help, of course.
We knew once Chuck heard you were free again, he'd do something foolish.
Of course, even I didn't think it would happen this fast.
Anyway, I must get back to Monaco.
I have a prince to console.
Cheers.
Hmm.
Standing ovation? Why, thank you.
Oh, my God.
I was just bitch-slapped by Bridget Jones.
You don't realize what you've done.
Yes, I do.
I've brought to light the real villain, and let me give you a hint.
It's not me.
You bankrupted the Waldorf family.
That's what paying this dowry is gonna do to them.
It was that much? No.
You left me no choice.
It would be one thing losing Blair because she doesn't wanna be with me, but I only lost her because of something you did.
Were you ever really my friend, or was it all just an act so you could keep me in check until you got what you wanted? Chuck, that is not how any of it happened, and you know it.
You framed me, and in my book, that makes you the bad guy, not me.
What's going on? Ever since the accident, Dan has been trying to keep us apart so you can have you all to himself.
Be honest for once in your life.
Tell her the truth.
She deserves that.
He's absolutely right.
I'm sorry.
"11--I leave my collection of early British watercolors to my youngest daughter, Lily.
" I'm sensing a pattern here.
Oh, frankly, Carol, I'm surprised it took you this long to realize what mother really thought of you.
Oh, come on, mom.
We're almost done here.
No, she knew that she was a greedy, spoiled-- Excuse me, Lily.
I'm not the one who's been married five times.
Ladies Most of which was for money.
Excuse me-- Well, at least I didn't try and embezzle my own daughter's trust fund so I could go shopping at Lululemon.
Okay.
The truth is, the only reason mother left you those trinkets "As for the rest of my estate, all remaining property, artwork, antiques.
.
"Stocks and bonds, bullion" Is because you pretended to love her and she pretended to love you.
At least we had an honest relationship.
"Contents of my safety deposit boxes and assorted holdings" William, I can't hear a thing.
"I leave to you.
" Y-you mean Charlotte Rhodes, my daughter.
This is not the real Charlie Rhodes.
Lola is.
No, I'm afraid not, Carol.
It says-- It says so right here.
Ivy Dickens.
You are never gonna get away with this.
Let's call the police.
Oh, please.
Wait.
Look, I never asked Cece for anything.
Oh, no, instead you poisoned her against her entire family and manipulated her into giving you everything.
That's not true.
Your grandmother just wanted someone to talk to.
Oh, please.
You don't think we can see through all your lies? You were a terrible actress when we first met, and you still are.
Mom-- I swear on my life all I ever did was help take care of her.
I mean, I even tried to tell you that she was sick.
Ohh.
Oh, but conveniently failed.
Look, will you please shut up? Forget about the money.
That's easy for you to say.
You each still have your trusts.
Mine was liquidated years ago.
How do we know Ivy didn't try to hasten our mother's death? Are you people crazy? Look, I loved her.
That's my cue.
I think I've heard enough.
This You can think whatever you want about me.
But I never lied to Cece.
Prove it.
Well, didn't you hear the will? She didn't call me "Charlie Rhodes.
" She called me "Ivy Dickens.
" Your mother knew all of my secrets, and she knew all of yours, too.
Maybe that's why she left me everything.
Ever since the accident, I've been blaming myself, blaming Louis, but it was Humphrey behind it all.
It's not that simple.
Yes, it is, and now that we know the truth, there is nothing in our way.
Humphrey's not the reason we're not together, and neither is the dowry.
Is this about saving my life again? Because we're past that.
You said you wanted to wait until your marriage was over.
Now it's over.
Chuck, I don't blame you.
And as crazy as this all has gotten, I know why you did everything.
Because I love you.
And I love you.
I always will.
But that doesn't mean I'm in love with you.
At least not right now, not the way you need me to be, not the way you deserve.
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
Hey.
Look, I know how that must have seemed up there, but Ivy Dickens is a thief.
She already stole your identity and your money, and now she's about to rob the rest of us.
Your family needs you right now.
You're not my family, and honestly, after listening to everybody upstairs, the only person I feel sorry for is Ivy.
She's a criminal.
Because your family made her into one.
Serena, all you people do is lie to each other and fight about money, so what's the difference, really? You know, it was my own fault for sticking around today.
I was dumb enough to think that there might be some answers here for me.
At least now I know I was wrong.
Care to join me, for old times' sake? Oh, cut the crap, William.
You need to fix this.
Cece's wishes are Cece's wishes.
I don't care what she wanted.
Today was supposed to be my payday, and you know that.
I understand you're upset.
No, you don't understand a thing.
If you can't find a way to make this right, I'm gonna be forced to resort to other ways to get my money.
Like getting a real job? I've always hesitated going after Lola's father for child support he owes me, oh, almost 20 years.
Good luck with that.
Do you even know who he is? I'm looking right at him.
Sorry I never told you, but not as sorry as you're gonna be when Lily finds out what we were doing while you were married, unless, of course, you have another idea? This just is my lucky day.
Spotted--Dr.
Van Der Woodsen white as a sheet.
Looks like the rules of this Rhodes just changed before his very eyes.
How'd you get past the doorman? Wait.
I don't even wanna know.
Look, I know no one believes a word I say, but I really didn't mean to hurt you.
You were just collateral damage.
Well, if it had been anyone else but me, I might believe you, but we both know you've always wanted to settle the score between us.
You have to understand.
When I decided to stop being Gossip Girl, I knew that anyone who knew or found out would have it out for me.
So I realized I'd better start collecting favors to use as protection down the line.
Running that picture of you kissing Dan was my golden ticket to use with Chuck down the road.
I'd love one from you, too.
Are you using again? Why would I ever make myself indebted to you? Because I have a way that your family doesn't have to pay the Grimaldis a thing, and you get your divorce in the process.
Even you can't pull that rabbit out of your hat.
I was Gossip Girl for two months.
You have no idea the dirt I have on people.
I've been so good for so long, it's time for me to be bad.
I can help you.
Let me solve all your problems.
Fine.
Anything to be done with this.
Do what you can, and if you succeed, then I'll enjoy whatever horror you concoct.
Believe me, I won't let you down, and you won't let me down, either, when I come back.
Charles.
Lily, I'm sorry for your loss.
Oh.
Tough day, as they say.
For you, too? Oh, no, I wouldn't dream of adding to your burden.
Oh, come on.
You never have.
It would be a good distraction.
What's wrong? Blair.
She walked away from me today, and not like she has done in the past.
It was different.
I feel like she's changing.
I know I didn't die in the car accident, but sometimes it feels like I did.
Don't say that.
You survived, and it was a miracle.
Yeah.
Thanks to Saint Waldorf.
You mean thanks to Saint Jack.
The doctors didn't tell you? Oh, it's all such a blur now.
Um When you were in surgery, there was a complication, and they needed a family member for a blood transfusion, and I gave the doctors Jack's number.
Jack? Yes.
You haven't lived until you've tried caramel mousse and chocolate.
Are you just gonna ply me with sweets until I cheer up? Because I think I'll probably go into sugar shock before that happens.
I am so sorry.
I mean, truly.
No, don't be.
You're about the only good thing in my life right now.
Sorry.
Hello? Lola.
It's William Van Der Woodsen.
Hey.
Sorry to bother you.
I just felt badly we weren't able to finish our conversation, so I asked Serena for your phone number.
Oh, no.
You know, today was a lot for everybody, so no apology necessary.
Well, I'm at the Empire if you need to reach me, okay? Okay.
Great.
Yeah.
I'll call you then, I guess.
Bye.
So after all that, you're really just giving up "Gossip Girl"? Well, with Chuck and Blair beholden to me, I'm more powerful than ever.
It's time to pass the "Gossip Girl" baton.
Let someone else see if they can outshine me, or at the very least, die trying.
Now be a doll and send this for me.
My flight to Monaco is in two hours, and be very careful with this.
There's stuff on this laptop that'll blow people's minds.
Bring back pictures.
Don't you worry.
Bye.
Finally, some peace and quiet.
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting something? Yes, you are.
It's been a long day for everyone.
I think it'd be best if you left.
I was just gonna say the same thing But to the two of you.
What are you talking about? This is my apartment now.
That's ridiculous.
You think we're just gonna let you live here.
This all just needs to get sorted out.
Naturally.
But you'll have to do it from someplace else.
Oh, and where are we supposed to go? It's not like we have another apartment in the city.
It's-- Yes, we do, Lil.
Oh.
Come on.
I'll just get my things.
Oh, Ms.
Serena.
I tidy up later.
No, it's okay.
It was beautiful wake for Ms.
Cece.
Good-byes never easy.
Yeah, I know, but that's all I seem to say these days-- to my grandma, to jobs, to boys, to everything.
I'm just sick of good-byes.
Something new arrive soon.
It always does.
I hope so.
I'm ready for it, whatever it is.
Attention, Upper East Siders.
After everything that happened today, I've decided I need a little break to catch my breath.
I'm sure you do, too.
But don't worry.
I'll be back.
I always am.
Gossip Girl here Your one and only source in the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I needed a family member for a blood transfusion, and I gave the doctors Jack's number.
Jack? I told Chuck he doesn't have my heart anymore.
I realized it belongs to someone else.
I've always hesitated going after Lola's father for child support.
Do you know who he is? I'm looking right at him.
It's time to pass the Gossip Girl baton.
Now be a doll and send this for me.
There's stuff on this laptop that'll blow people's minds.
Why did you introduce this girl as your daughter? Who is she? Ivy Dickens.
Your mom hired me to be you.
"As for the rest of my estate, I leave to you, Ivy Dickens.
" I think it'd be best if you left.
I was just gonna say the same thing.
This is my apartment now.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Dear "S by S" readers, it looks like spring has finally sprung, and lucky for us, one thing that hasn't yet popped up is Gossip Girl.
Hopefully my family's unfortunate exile to Brooklyn will pass quietly and with dignity.
What's wrong? I'm perfect as usual And we've been waiting weeks, so Blair.
Oh, God.
I thought you said they were having breakfast with William.
Yes.
Here.
You're welcome to join us.
How could I say no? If I had known this was what you meant when you invited me for a corporate retreat, I might have packed differently.
You didn't need clothes for mistress Katya's blindfolded trust exercise, but I would wear something more suitable when I thank you officially for saving my life.
What, from that arsonist, Russell Thorpe? That was a year ago.
Took you long enough.
No, no, no, I'm referring to the car accident-- your blood donation, after my body rejected the first transfusion, and I needed the family member.
Oh.
That.
Well, I wouldn't be here without you.
I'm eternally grateful.
Yeah, well, I considered letting you die and taking your billions.
That's probably why you let me have all the hot ones last night.
My first gift.
My second is a bit larger.
I've endowed a new wing at the hospital where I was treated.
It's going to be the Jack Bass pavilion.
Tonight is the ribbon cutting ceremony for the renovation.
Seriously? You're not just trying to get me to the hospital to put me in rehab? No, but that said, you might want to get rid of the evidence of last night's exploits before we go.
I'll sleep it off with you and you.
Come on.
Mmm.
Well, I may have made a few too many waffles, but it's only because it's great to be back in my old kitchen.
You mean with the stove with the burners you have to light with a match? It's the quirks-- the little quirks that make it feel like home.
You know, I never knew that the croissants in Brooklyn rivaled Sant Ambroeus.
They don't.
I ran up there this morning.
I also stopped by to see Vanya, who had some packages for me and arranged to have, um, Serena's delivered.
It is ludicrous that we have to go to these lengths to get our own mail.
William, please tell me you found a way to fix this.
Well, there's nothing technically wrong with the will, so as executor, my hands are tied.
The law requires that I remain neutral.
Lily and I have a meeting with Bruce Caplan later.
I think it's best if we get our legal opinions from an expert.
He won't tell you anything different.
William, what are you even still doing here? Uh, Rufus, William, let's not let Ivy drive us apart.
Well, sounds like everyone's got a lot to do today.
I think you should probably get started right away.
Uh, Blair and I can clean up.
I don't-- uh see why you shouldn't all leave immediately, because when you are dealing with a charlatan like Ivy Dickens, time is of the essence.
Did you see what Lily and Serena said about me today in the paper? I don't read the paper.
Not even your boyfriend's? 'Cause that's where it is.
They said my father's fatal overdose sparked my lifetime of criminal behavior.
I'm not a criminal.
You know that.
Well, a year ago, I might have agreed with you, but now Lily has plenty of money.
Cece just wanted me to have some, too.
Ivy, I really think it would be best if you stopped calling me, okay? Lola! Hey, I was just about to call you.
Is there any chance I could interview you for my Ivy Dickens story? I'm sorry, Serena.
I'm really not comfortable getting involved.
You already are involved, never mind what she did to your family, but what she did to you was worst of all.
I mean, she stole your identity.
I really don't wanna talk about it, okay? Especially not in the press.
Okay.
Well, if you change your mind.
I swear that wasn't another botched attempt to get you two together.
She just works here.
I know.
All I wanna do is figure out if I fit into this family, but I don't know how to do that in the middle of a war with Ivy.
Well, did you ever call your uncle William back? He's Cece's executor.
She obviously trusted him a lot.
Maybe he has some ideas.
Yeah, I guess it couldn't hurt to go ask.
Oh.
This coffee is probably cold, and I've just dumped a bunch of my problems in your lap, but I swear I came here with good intentions-- a warm beverage and a little moral support before your big investor meeting.
Thanks.
I'm trying, Carol, but a will is a legal document.
I can't just overturn it because you're blackmailing me.
I don't care what's legal.
I want my inheritance.
You can pay me out of your pocket if it's easier.
You know I can't do that.
I work for a living.
Then get ready for Serena and Eric to hate you when they find out that you fathered my daughter while you were married to their mother.
Lily will never forgive you, and you know that.
You hired someone to play our daughter to keep it secret.
Yes, which should give you some sense of what I'm willing to do to get my money.
Bye! Good luck with the lawyer.
I thought I had a primping problem.
How long does it take two middle-aged people to leave the apartment? At least they're finally gone.
We need to move fast.
I don't know how long this meeting's gonna take.
Well, at least our month of failed intimacy attempts brought to light every possible potential problem.
Oh, yeah, and I moved the condoms from the dresser to the nightstand-- That's one I don't care to relive.
It wasn't as bad as the time my dad and Lily-- Twice.
Three times less than Serena went into our shared bathroom.
Yeah, and how does that housekeeper filling in for Dorota not know how to knock? We can't even escape to a proper pied-a-terre in Manhattan until Georgina gets me my divorce, or my family will have to pay the dowry.
But nothing is in our way now.
Not even another unfortunate unzipping incident.
Oh, my poor Prabal.
Wait.
What? Do you feel that? Uh? It's like someone's watching us.
Um it's just Cedric.
Uh, maybe that'll stop.
Earplugs? Noise-canceling headphones? This came for you.
Thank you so much.
Hey, do you have those numbers for your column? I need them for my meeting.
Yeah, they're on my desk.
Thanks.
Oh, hey, I saw you and Lola earlier.
Maybe you could take it easy on her like she asked.
If you don't mind, I think I'll determine how to handle my family.
Well, it was just a suggestion.
S.
, welcome to your future as Gossip Girl 3.
0.
I wouldn't tell anyone you have this.
Trust me, anonymity is key, and don't pretend you're not intrigued.
We all know there's only one Upper East Side blogger who matters, and it's not S by S.
The power is now in your hands.
Your old friend G.
, singular.
P.
S.
Keep the password to yourself.
The only recourse you really have is if you can prove that Cece wasn't of sound mind when she changed her will.
Everyone we spoke with said that your mother's mind was sharp to the end, even with the gin.
There's no other way to get the court to overturn the will? They'll only grant a hearing and freeze the assets with evidence of wrongdoing on Ivy's part.
Well, she pretended to be my niece.
What could be more wrong than that? Nothing, if Cece had named Charlie Rhodes in her will, but she left everything to Ivy Dickens.
Cece clearly knew who she really was.
At least we have plenty of money and a great place to live while we figure this out.
I'm sorry, Rufus, but I can't see a bright side to a con artist living in my home, debasing my mother's memory.
She did something illegal.
I just have to find it.
I don't understand.
I'm offering to pay you just to show me fabric.
Okay.
Fine.
Having trouble finding a decorator? Or an art consultant or a personal shopper or anyone from the Upper East Side to talk to me.
What's the point of having all this money if no one will let me spend it? Well, perhaps I can be of assistance.
For a percentage of that money, of course.
I'd pay anything to get Lily and Serena to stop blackballing me.
All you have to do is throw a party.
Why? No one will come.
They'll have no choice if it's a benefit to honor the Celia Rhodes Cancer Foundation.
I'll see to that for a healthy fee.
You just can't let anybody know that it was my idea.
You've done a great job building up a full-fledged news source, but with so many other media options, what sets you apart to compete long term? Well, we don't just follow the news.
We're the people involved in it, so we get the stories and perspectives that no one else has access to.
Isn't that Serena Van Der Woodsen? I've seen her in the society pages.
Exactly my point.
Serena.
This is James Mackenzie.
He's considering becoming our new financial partner.
Oh.
It's a pleasure.
Serena's blog is one of "The Spectator's" biggest draws.
I'm just writing a story right now on Ivy Dickens.
That's the woman who inherited everything from your grandmother.
I read about her.
Like I said, Serena's writing from the inside.
She's our generation's Dominick Dunne.
I can't wait to read it.
Nate, you can expect an official offer by tonight.
Thank you, James.
I look forward to working with you.
I'll see myself out.
I hope he means it.
His offer is the only one with the money we need.
So thank you.
I think your Ivy expose helped close the deal.
Is that the story? Oh.
Gossip Girl's back? I think so.
I don't know.
I was just, um, looking up some stuff on Ivy, but there is a new post.
Do you know she's throwing a party tonight in Cece's honor? I can't believe this girl.
She has no shame.
That we knew.
Strange I didn't get the blast yet.
I figured she was still on vacation, whatever that means.
Yeah.
I-I just got it now, so I'm sure you'll get it soon.
Well, let me know what you find on Ivy.
I'm gonna go see how we're doing on that Jack-Bass-saving-Chuck story.
There was no answer in Dr.
Van Der Woodsen's room, so I was wondering if I could leave a message.
Oh.
Actually, never mind.
Lily just R.
S.
V.
P.
'd she's coming.
The plan's working.
And thanks for helping me with the caterer.
You can keep the "thank yous," but I'll take that check you offered.
I still haven't heard from Serena.
Well, that wasn't part of our agreement.
Look, I've lived here long enough to know not to write a check until they actually show up.
I'll see what I can do.
Hey.
If I have to be sober tonight, shouldn't you? I just had an interesting conversation with Nate.
It's about time he confessed his true feelings for you.
"The Spectator" is doing a story on the hospital dedication tonight, and his reporter did some research on you.
Well, if she's having a coronary reading about my history, then I can help her.
I'm about to have my own hospital wing.
Incredibly, it wasn't your fondness of the beer bath at Chodovar or your restraining orders that caught her eye.
It was your time at Eton.
It's an English boarding school.
Everyone tries it.
Schoolboy exploits aside, spending more than 3 months in the U.
K.
from 1980 to 1996 prohibits you from donating blood in this country.
Didn't they ask you about that? Yeah.
They also asked me if I ever used drugs or slept with prostitutes.
I told them what they wanted to hear so I could save your life.
Right.
I should've known better than to expect you to play by the rules.
It's the only way I'm predictable.
I should get to the hospital, make sure everything's ready for tonight.
I'll see you there.
I'll just drink enough to behave normally.
How'd your meeting go? I should have the official offer tonight.
Oh, that's great.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
You're a good actress, but that smile doesn't look real.
What's wrong? Not to sound tacky, but can I ask you a rich person question? I put my extensive knowledge of privilege fully at your disposal.
Well, when I went to go see William, I ended up overhearing Ivy offering him money.
He's the executor of Cece's will, so that's sketchy, right? A beneficiary is not allowed to reward an executor.
It would call the entire inheritance into question if he was working for her.
Do you think William would really do that to his family, though? Well, William's history isn't exactly pristine.
He's been known to con people and so is Ivy.
I mean, this would be grounds to contest the will in court.
I think you have to tell Serena.
I have to think about it.
And I have to get to class, too.
Let's just keep this between us for now, okay? Yeah.
Okay.
Let me guess.
You're redecorating.
I know that the jewelry mother left me is here somewhere.
I can't believe I have to go to a benefit for my mother as a guest at my home.
You sure you don't want me there for moral support? No, you've so been looking forward to this magnetic fields concert, and let's be honest.
I fake a happy face better than you do.
I just wanted to wear something of Cece's to remind everyone who her true daughter really is.
Hmm.
Will, uh, this necklace work? It's perfect.
Thank you.
Mm.
I know how hard this has been, Lil.
Um, so if it helps, I decided to buy us a little privacy.
You reconsidered about the hotel? Well, just for tonight, to start.
Oh, that's great, and then once we realize it's easier, we can always extend.
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna pack.
No.
You don't need any more stress.
That's why I got the room for Dan.
I should take this for the loft.
I don't know how I didn't think of that sooner.
And us entering separately eliminated the threat of anyone seeing us together.
Alas, no car alarms.
There's no construction.
No friends, no housekeepers, or family to interrupt.
I think I forgot the champagne at your place.
We don't need it or this conversation.
Let's hope good flings come to those who wait.
Wow.
Yeah.
My words exactly.
Well, it was only one word.
One's all you need, really.
Yeah.
Well, I would love to stay for seconds, but I should really get back home and make sure that fake Dorota doesn't put my Lemaire cashmere in the washer again.
Well, it's understandable.
Well, I-I mean, anyway, we're both Going to that horrible Ivy thing tonight, right? I mean, that's the only reason why we had to finish in such a timely fashion.
Yeah, family obligations are important.
Right.
Well I'll see you over Tacky aperitifs.
I'm sorry, Mr.
Bass.
There must be a misspelling or a glitch in the system.
I can't find your file.
All my records are missing? I was on duty the night of your accident, but the only Bass that came up in my search is first name Jack.
Oh, his records are fine, too, actually.
Except I'm not allowed to show you another patient's information.
Of course.
I'm just trying to find out some specifics about his blood donation that saved my life.
I was hoping to mention them when I dedicate the new wing in his honor.
He's the one who gave you blood? I don't understand.
I'm sorry.
I can't discuss someone else's chart.
So I'll stop asking you, too.
Could you let director Brancolini know that I'm here? I'd like to speak with him before the ceremony.
My pleasure.
I don't understand.
If Lola saw my dad take money from Ivy, then why didn't she tell me herself? You know this is complicated for her.
I just thought you deserved to know, and this way, Lola doesn't have to be in the middle of anything.
Oh, yeah, but instead she'll just accuse my dad of taking bribes.
Look, he would never do something like that.
Lola just must have heard wrong.
I don't think she did, but don't worry.
I'm not gonna write anything until I confirm it.
You're not gonna write anything? What are you talking about? This is my article.
You're too close, Serena.
I'm sorry.
I can't take a chance on the article that hooked Mackenzie.
Hey, dad.
I-I'm so glad it's you.
I wanted to ask you something.
Great.
Let's chat at Ivy Dickens' party tonight.
I wasn't planning on going to that.
Why on earth are you? I know how you feel about her, but it is a benefit to honor your grandmother.
I felt we should all be there as a family.
Um okay.
You know what, dad? Um I guess you're right.
I'll be there at 7:30.
Great.
All right, love.
Serena's coming.
All we need now is for Ivy to write that check.
Yes, our proof she's engaging in illegal activity.
The court will have to agree to hear our case.
Ticktock, Upper East Siders.
This time bomb is about to send Ivy's party up in smoke.
I thought it was crank call when you say that you come to Queens.
Why? You know my manners are impeccable, even if it means crossing into unsavory areas to give you a baby gift.
You weren't there to wrap it, so This is re-gift from your wedding to prince, not present for Leo.
Well, everyone brings the child a gift, but no one needs champagne more than a new mother.
You must have something to break these in with.
This will do.
Hey, I'll be here.
Thanks.
Hey, man.
I was just in the neighborhood.
Thought I'd stop by to see if you, uh, you wanted to grab a drink or you know what? We could just drink here.
I figure you must have something, unless you haven't honored our "Be like Don Draper" pact.
Does this sudden onset alcoholism have something to do with Blair? No.
Uh, Blair's great.
It's perfectly normal for a new relationship to need time to find its, uh, its groove.
The s*x was bad, wasn't it? It happened to you, too? It must be her, then.
That makes me feel a lot better.
Now that you drink, spill.
What Mr.
Lonely Boy do? Don't tell me the anatomical reason he always so lonely? Dorota! No! Everything was physically appealing, but the problem wasn't the man.
It was the deed.
You see, I didn't have any technical difficulties.
It was just inexplicably terrible.
Hmm, sounds like a classic case of the Dan Humphrey overthink.
All right, so what if after the build-up, that aspect of the relationship doesn't work? Maybe he nervous.
What he say when you tell him s*x only so-so? Well, what did Blair say about it? Nothing at all.
Oh, you mean after you lied and told her how great it was? Honesty is your only shot at making this any better.
Well, it would've been impolite, and I didn't want to upset him.
Upset is only the beginning if you say nothing.
It take honest communication to turn Vanya from boy to man in bedroom.
I'm gonna need another drink to forget I just heard that.
You need to go talk to her.
Okay.
Just after one more drink.
You're looking for answer in wrong borough.
You need to talk to Mr.
Lonely Boy.
Fine.
But I'm gonna need a stronger buzz to enter Ivy's party.
We're only good friends.
Wine? Oh.
Red wine at a cocktail party.
Excuse me.
Why? What's wrong with it? Well, you don't serve red when people are moving around.
If they were to spill Well, I trust my guests, including you.
Thank you for coming.
Yes, well, you know quite well that I would not miss a chance to honor my mother.
I miss her, too.
I know she would want us to be close, so I was hoping we could respect her wishes by talking again.
We used to have such a wonderful relationship.
Yes, yes, under, uh, false pretenses.
Then let this be our fresh start.
Um, excuse me.
Could we have a picture, please? For Cece.
Since when do ribbon cuttings involve crippled kids? I wouldn't call him crippled to his face.
Sorry, kid, but let's face it.
You're crippled.
Michael, meet Jack.
Don't touch me.
After hearing about his brave battle with leukemia, I decided a blood drive would be a much better symbol of your heroism than a simple ribbon cutting.
Well, another needle in the arm doesn't sound like a celebration, unless it's putting something in.
We can celebrate properly later.
He's ready.
Okay, you know I can't give that kid my blood, so Go away.
Thank you, Michael.
Tell your agent the check's in the mail.
You played me with a fake kid? No, the kid's real.
He's just not sick.
But you are-- with hepatitis.
Since I don't have it, I know you didn't give me blood.
It's the only way I could get you to admit it.
So I guess this is the end of the Jack Bass Wing.
Well, we can discuss that after you tell me the truth.
Looks like you're having a stellar debut.
Which means I did my job.
Yes.
Thank you.
And I will write you that check just after I talk to Lauren San Domingo.
I can't believe she came.
Hey.
How you holding up? Well, seeing our home taken over by Florida trash is torture, but I'm taking it in stride.
It'll all be over soon.
She offered your father a bribe.
How do you know that? Well, William told me right after she did it.
Luckily, he thought quickly and he accepted, knowing it was the ammunition we need to take her case to court.
He'll likely be removed as executor, but he's willing to make that sacrifice for us.
Mom, that's that's amazing, but what are you waiting for? Ivy hasn't written your father a check yet.
Hopefully it'll be any minute.
Now look, I know how much you dislike her, but don't say anything yet.
We don't wanna spook her.
That's just what I was thinking.

  You know, I just realized I have an 8
0 deadline.
Um, I hope she didn't pack up my old computer.
Excuse me.
Oh, Serena.
Hi, Mr.
Cavett.
Oh, you look like a million bucks before taxes.
Oh, thank you.
As the late Bob Hope would say Oh, seriously, though, I was so sorry to hear about your grandmother's passing.
She was such a-- how would you say-- such a--such an original woman, wouldn't you say? Oh, yes.
Well, thank you.
Dan.
Blair, hey.
What are you doing here? I'm, um same as you.
I'm just going to-- going to the party.
So let's go up, instead of staying here and talking 'cause there's nothing to talk about.
Yeah.
I agree.
There's nothing at all.
I hope she has a full bar.
Yeah.
Mm, me, too.
Oh, Serena, go easier on me in your column from now on.
Oh, you gotta stop being so scandalous.
Look, I can't miss this deadline.
Take care.
Oh, Serena, I've been looking for you everywhere.
Now's not a good time.
It's about Ivy.
I would love to talk about her, but I just have to do something before 8:00.
You can steal money, but you can't steal class.
Looks like Ivy's poisoned what little remained of her good will.
Last I heard, it was illegal to bribe an executor.
That's what I wanted to tell you.
I guess Gossip Girl got to it first.
And ruined everything.
I should have known you only came to humiliate me with more of your lies.
I didn't bribe William.
You tried.
You said you'd pay me to get people to attend this party.
Because you offered.
This is just all a setup.
The only setup here is whatever you did to manipulate my mother.
You have no proof I did anything wrong.
You'd kick me out of this house, and you can't.
I should have never had you back.
Please, you have to tell everyone that you saw Ivy offer to pay my father.
You're the only proof we have.
I don't know, Serena.
From what I saw, it looked like William was in on it.
He only agreed to take the money to prove that Ivy was defrauding people.
I didn't know his plan either.
That's why I'm the one that sent the tip in to "Gossip Girl.
" Now you're the only one who can fix what I screwed up.
This is your chance to help our family.
Oh, stop saying "our".
I still don't know if I wanna be part of this family.
Is that really how you feel? Or how your mother wants you to? 'Cause she kept you from us your entire life.
She lied to you because she didn't want anyone else to love you, not to mention, she never even told you who your father was.
What does my father have to do with this? Because without him and without her, we're the only family you have left.
And we really need you.
This elevator is so slow.
Feels like it's not even moving.
Did you push the button? I thought you did it.
Ah, you are wasted.
This elevator smells like vodka.
Vodka doesn't smell, and You are drunker than I am.
And I can tell by the fact that you're not hyper-verbal that you are avoiding something.
Well, I can tell by the fact that you drank vodka that you are, too.
Mm.
You first.
Fine.
Fine.
I wasn't 100% honest with you today.
Me neither.
That "wow" really meant "Wow, that was terrible.
" And it was just--it was mind-numbingly boring.
Like the least sexy thing since Courtney Stodden.
Yeah, I mean, I don't know who that is, but it's much worse.
Oh, so what--what are Is our chemistry just purely intellectual? Is it only in our heads? Apparently.
But before we, uh, we--we break up, I just wanna let you know that you were really, really good in my head.
I am really, really good out of it, too.
No.
I don't think so.
Hey, I will prove it to you.
Right--right here in this elevator? Mm.
But people have to go up and down.
Mm, yes, they do.
I'd like to think my night with Pamela Anderson was worth it, but it hasn't seemed to slow me down.
I like to think of myself as the Magic Johnson of Hep-C.
Why didn't you just tell me the truth? And give up a hospital wing in my name? We both know if you wanted one, you'd just buy one.
You're covering for who really gave me the blood-- Elizabeth.
She didn't want you to know, especially, well, after she told you she wasn't your mother.
Well, I guess this proves otherwise once and for all.
I'd like to thank her.
She's unreachable.
I mean, just refer to your previous 20 years on earth.
Let it be.
Does it matter why you're alive? The fact is, you are.
This weekend did remind me how much I value all my senses.
We're all the family we need.
Let's do this again.
My turf next time.
Do I need to call security to escort you out? We're just waiting for the elevator, okay? And we'll be back.
This is our home.
Not anymore.
Tonight made me see why Cece left it all to me.
You're so selfish that you couldn't even honor her for an hour.
I cared about her.
All you care about is ruining me with your lies.
It's not a lie.
Lola.
I heard you offering to pay William myself.
That's exactly the proof we need.
No, it's not.
They're setting me up.
You know I wouldn't do that.
All I know is what I saw, Ivy.
I'll have my lawyers start proceedings to contest the will immediately.
Go ahead.
You don't have a case.
I didn't do anything wrong.
The court will decide that.
In the meantime, your assets will be frozen.
Thank you for coming forward.
I can't believe you're taking their side.
I mean, they're just using you.
And when they're done, they'll throw you out just like they did me.
No, they won't.
They're my family.
Looks like Lola's untangled some knots to form family ties.
Well, this just proves sometimes you gotta throw away the first pancake.
I don't know how breakfast food has anything to do with this, but obviously, this afternoon was an anomaly.
Where to? Rufus and Lily are definitely gonna come back to the loft at some point.
Mm, Serena will be at my place.
I still have that hotel room.
To be haunted by the ghost of bad s*x past? You two lovebirds going somewhere or not? I need another drink.
All right.
Uh, take us to Williamsburg, please.
There's a place there.
It's got about 300 whiskeys.
And hopefully a clean bathroom we can use.
Thanks again for coming forward up there.
It's the least I can do after thinking you were conspiring with Ivy.
Sorry about that.
It's hard to know what to think when no one's told you the whole story.
Seriously.
No one's ever told me my whole story.
I used to know your mother pretty well.
And if she's concealing things from you, then it's Probably only to protect you.
Protect me? How did it protect me to grow up alone with no family but her? Hey.
Talk to your mom.
Forgive her.
I messed things up so badly with Serena and Eric, that it took a long time to rebuild the relationship, and they found a place in their hearts to forgive me, but I would never do anything ever again to lose them.
I know.
Parents are human.
Everybody makes mistakes.
What if my dad doesn't even know I exist? What if all he'd want is to know me? I'm sure he does.
Here's your cab.
You catch this one, okay? I'll catch the next.
Thank you.
Good night.
Hey.
I got your text.
What's so important I had to come into the office tonight? "The Spectator's" entire future.
What are you talking about? Mr.
Mackenzie saw the story about Ivy you obviously sent in to "Gossip Girl.
" You knew I hooked him with our exclusive access.
He said if I couldn't deliver on that, he couldn't trust me to deliver on the big things either.
He backed out, Serena.
I'm sorry, Nate.
I-I just wanted to help my family, and you wouldn't let me put it on "The Spectator.
" Yeah, well, that's all well and good, but you're fired.
A-are you kidding me? None of this would have happened if you hadn't taken the story away from me.
Yeah, and I was right not to trust you with it or anything else.
Now I have to go try and save the jobs of the people who still work here.
Spring is the season of rebirth-- a time for change A time to blossom.
I know it's a victory, but what if Ivy pulls an Anna Nicole Smith and takes it to the Supreme Court? This could take years.
Maybe we should look for another place.
We have another place.
No, I mean a more permanent home.
Took me a while to get used to the Upper East Side, too.
Oh.
But there are always late bloomers.
Do you take credit cards? Sorry, miss, we don't.
And some buds are nipped before they can grow.
Whoo! That Japanese whisky went so well with Croque Monsieur.
I told you.
Great things grow in Brooklyn.
Well, now we have the problem of where do we go from here? Uh here looks pretty good.
What? New relationships flourish and take on new form Andrew, you remember the woman with the locket I had you look for a couple years ago? Elizabeth Fisher? Yeah, my mother.
I need to find her again.
While old relationships can be re-examined.
I just left Chuck.
He knows it wasn't my blood.
I think you should come back and handle it yourself.
But some things never change.
This is the Upper East Side, in case you forgot.
Before you say anything, I'm sorry that I told Serena what you saw.
I wanted an honest relationship, and I shouldn't have betrayed your trust.
Thanks.
I'm just glad everything's on the table now.
Yeah.
I don't wanna move, but I know it's my lawyer.
All right, please tell me we have an offer that'll at least keep "The Spectator" afloat.
Yes, I, uh, I do know Diana Payne.
I read your blog, and while you do a pretty good me, you're not the real deal.
So if you'll just hand over the password, I'd like my site back.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here.
Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
It's time to pass the Gossip Girl baton.
Let someone else see if they can outshine me.
Welcome to your future as Gossip Girl 3.
0.
The power is now in your hands.
So I guess we're cousins.
Up until ten minutes ago, I didn't even know I had a family.
Please tell me we have an offer that'll at least keep "The Spectator" afloat.
Yes, I do know Diana Payne.
You're covering for who really gave me the blood-- Elizabeth.
She didn't want you to know.
You remember the woman with the locket I had you look for a couple years ago? Yeah, my mother.
I need to find her again.
"As for the rest of my estate, "I leave to you, Ivy Dickens.
" I think it would be best if you left.
I was just gonna say the same thing.
This is my apartment now.
You don't have a case.
I didn't do anything wrong.
The court will decide that.
In the meantime, your assets will be frozen.
I told Chuck he doesn't have my heart anymore.
I realized it belongs to someone else.
If she defaults on the marriage, the dowry can be reinstated.
I have a way that your family doesn't have to pay the Grimaldis a thing, and you get your divorce in the process.
Fine.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

, Gossip Girl.
Every once in a while, a life-changing event will arrive with fanfare and excitement.
Miss Blair.
Package from legal firm of Kier, Grandineti and Booth.
Divorce papers! Oh, sweet legal freedom! Thank God.
I thought Louis was gonna drag this on forever.
Georgina move fast.
What do you think she do to make happen? It's best we don't think, Dorota.
Georgina went black ops on this one, and while I'm sure I'm eventually gonna pay a price for my plausible deniability, right now I'm just gonna enjoy the bliss of ignorance.
Which means I can stop avoiding them and call Dan! Oh! Now we can date outside the confines of the 7-1-8.
We can walk down Madison Avenue hand in hand without having to worry about Louis changing his mind.
In my experience, most turning points in our lives don't announce themselves.
If anything, they tend to creep up quietly when we're least expecting them and force us to make a decision that isn't so easy.
Any word from Jack or Andrew Tyler yet? Jack's not returning my calls, and it's been a week, and Andrew still hasn't been able to track down Elizabeth.
So now that you know she's your mother for sure, you think you, uh, want a relationship with her? I haven't decided yet.
And since she's M.
I.
A.
, I don't have to.
So in the meantime, I'm gonna head down to the spa and meet Mandy and Micheala from hospitality and catch a steam.
Coming? Gotta get to the office.
Diana's finally making an appearance today.
Oh.
The two of you running "The Spectator" again.
Ready for combat? There's no reason to think that we'll have anything to fight about.
She's an investor.
I'm still editor in chief.
I'm not worried about it.
I told myself the same thing before my night with the Australian women's softball team.
That ended up with a fractured rib and a tattoo of a kangaroo that I didn't know I had for a month.
All right, listen, Diana and I may have ended things badly on a personal level.
But professionally, we always worked well together, man.
And what does Lola think about you working with your ex? I don't know.
I haven't, uh, exactly told her about my past with Diana.
How could she not know? I mean, you were all over "Gossip Girl," "Page Six.
" No, Lola has no interest in the Upper East Side social scene.
But even if she did, what Diana and I used to be to each other doesn't matter anymore.
Maybe not to you, but why else would Diana be back? It can't be for a love of journalism.
Well, I don't know about that, but once I get the lay of the land with Diana, I'll tell Lola everything.
Well, you sound like you've got it all figured out.
Just don't be surprised if you end up with an angry ex-girlfriend and a tattoo of a kangaroo.
Hey! Congratulations.
Dorota told me it's your first official day as a single woman.
It's true.
I am finally freed of the shackles of royal matrimony and Louis' horrible family.
Well, now that you're ready to rejoin the civilian population, how do you plan to spend your first day as plain Blair Waldorf? Oh.
Sure.
Yeah, with With Dan.
I'm-- I know it hasn't been easy, but I am happy for you.
Ohh.
Of course.
A "Gossip Girl" blast about my divorce coming through.
How does she know everything so fast? She probably has someone staked out in front of the building.
You know what's strange? Ever since the real Gossip Girl's been back, I've barely been mentioned.
I just I wish that there was a way to stay off her radar forever.
Oh, please.
It is your destiny to be gossip-worthy.
What? Tonight, you are modeling a line of lingerie named after you at Kiki de Montparnasse.
Gossip Girl won't be able to resist.
You're always her number one target.
You don't have any brilliant ideas how to push me off the top of her list? So you really want out? I just--I'm ready to move on with my life, and I can't do that with Gossip Girl tracking my every move.
Well, you need to replace yourself.
Find a new Serena.
Use your influence to anoint her the new "It Girl.
" Retain control but stay out of the spotlight yourself.
Okay.
Well, where do I start? At the beginning, of course, with the defining moment.
I mean, you didn't really become Serena Van Der Woodsen until you got naked on that aircraft carrier.
You don't need to make it sound like a porno.
We were on a school trip.
And I wasn't naked.
I was wearing a dress.
A white, wet dress.
The photo landed on "Gossip Girl," and that was it.
It's gonna take a moment like that to create the next Serena Van Der Woodsen.
Okay, what about you? Now that you're saying good-bye to being a princess, does that mean you're ready to reclaim your crown as Queen B.
? So if it's your mom's sister's family, that means you gain what, an aunt? An uncle? Yeah, and two cousins-- Eric and Serena.
Actually, I'd kind of like to get to know Serena a little bit better, but The whole family overnight is kind of a lot.
You can't get to know her unless you spend time together.
Well, so what? I just call her up and say, "Hey, we're related.
Let's hang out"? It's so random.
Wow, your mom really screwed you up, didn't she? Nate.
What are you doing here? Hey.
I'm just on my way to work.
Nate, this is my friend Aidan from back home.
Hey.
We went to acting camp together.
He--he's checking out Julliard.
Uh I'm gonna grab a paper.
I wanna check out the reviews for "Peter and the Starcatchers.
" Okay.
Well, uh, you've never mentioned him before.
Do I sense a little jealousy? No, Aidan is just a friend.
And besides, he's not my type.
You are.
You wanna play hooky with us? I would, but I can't.
I got that new investor coming in.
I gotta go meet with her.
Oh, that's right.
What's her name--Diana Payne? What do you know about her? Uh, well, I know she doesn't like it when people are late, so I gotta run.
See you guys later.
That was weird, wasn't it? I mean, he mentioned that woman and then he just took off.
What are you doing? Oh, there's this site called "Gossip Girl.
" I'm just gonna see if there's anything about her on there.
Wow.
She is hot.
So after that, we have a Cindy Sherman exhibit we can check out at the M.
O.
M.
A.
And then tonight, there's a new restaurant that opened-- I-I'm sorry, Dan.
Cindy Sherman and her unflattering self-portraits aside, it sounds like you planned a perfect day.
But it's going to have to wait.
Well, the royal seal is missing on my divorce papers, and I don't want to let Louis get me on a technicality.
Uh, well, if it's something that small, then maybe it could be resolved today.
Oh, I'm sure Louis' lawyers are gone for the day.
The Monegasque work very short hours.
Okay, well, I just want to spend the day with you, so maybe we could just hang out here? Oh, uh, Serena's around.
We--we shouldn't rub it in her face.
I'll call you later.
Song lyrics.
Vanya and--and I love karaoke.
Dorota, while your reputation for loyalty is unassailable, you and I both know something is going on here.
So why don't you just leave the song lyrics on the table and step out of the room for a moment? You won't see a thing.
Only because I worry.
Sometimes even the best laid plans fall apart How's that? Excellent.
Just get the right-hand side down a bit.
Hello, darling.
Did you miss me? What the hell are you doing? You didn't really think you'd get to keep your office, did you? Don't worry.
You're gonna love your new cubicle.
Or you hit a wall when you were expecting a door.
Hey.
Hey, Lola.
What's up? I just found out that new investor in "The Spectator" is Diana Payne, Nate's ex-girlfriend.
He totally lied to me about her.
I don't know what to do.
I really like him.
But every now and then, you get lucky and the universe delivers the perfect solution.
You know what? Um I'm actually really glad you came to me, because I know exactly what to do.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get ready, Lola, because whatever Serena wants, Lola's gonna get.
Just get out of my office, please.
I'm an investor in this paper, which I think entitles me to an office, and I choose this one.
No.
Being an investor means you don't actually need to be here.
You're not even a majority shareholder, and it's my name on the masthead.
Not for long.
Do you think advertisers are really gonna want to do business with a kid now that I'm back? Well, they haven't had a problem with it so far.
Oh, please.
I've done the research, my luv.
Advertising is down.
You never did understand that s*x sells.
Fortunately, I do, which is why I'm co-hosting the "Down to Your Skivvie" party tonight at Kiki de Montparnasse.
After tonight, everyone is gonna be talking about how I'm back and your days are numbered.
You can't sponsor a "Spectator" party without me.
I'm not.
I'm doing it on my own.
If you're inviting advertisers, everyone's gonna think it's related to the paper, and I'll be there.
Fine, if you insist.
I'm assuming no plus-one.
Oh, I'll be bringing my girlfriend Lola.
No problem.
Enjoy your last day in here.
So what do you say we get out of here, go have a nice lunch at Daniel, and go shopping at barneys? Actually, I just came back from the city.
Oh.
I, uh, went to see Ivy, and I asked her if she would be willing to move out of the apartment if we unfroze the assets.
What?! We do not negotiate with terrorists, especially ones from Florida.
And you do not have the right to speak on my behalf.
I know, and I-I didn't agree to anything.
But, sweetie, Ivy did.
She offered to pack up and leave just as soon as you call your lawyers.
We could have you back in the apartment by the end of the day.
That is such a wonderful thing to do for me.
But unfreezing the assets means letting Ivy have my mother's money.
I don't think I can live with that.
You have enough money for generations of Rhodes to live comfortably.
Does that exhale mean that you'll call the lawyer and unfreeze the assets? Yes.
Fine.
You're right.
Good.
So I'll start packing, and then we'll go celebrate.
Your mother's been living in Vienna for the past six months.
I have an address and a mobile number, but I haven't made contact yet.
How do you want me to proceed? I'm not sure.
The fact that she was harder to find than a fugitive isn't lost on me.
Clearly, the woman doesn't want to be found.
I don't know that I can advise you, Chuck.
At this point, maybe you need a friend more than you need a private investigator.
Is there anyone in your life who got to know Elizabeth the last time she was here? Maybe you wanna talk to them, figure out what it is you really want and what to expect before you pursue this any further.
The one person who was there the whole way through is the one person that's not in my life anymore.
Blair Waldorf.
Then why did you pay her dowry? She doesn't know I did.
I-I don't want her to find out, ever.
Okay.
But even if that is the case, does that mean that you can't talk to her? Thank you so much, Tracy.
It's perfect.
Oh, great.
We're so excited you'll be modeling "The Serena" tonight.
Feel free to browse, and if you see anything you like, just let me know.
Okay.
So am I totally overreacting? About Nate, I mean.
Oh, and that looked amazing on you.
Oh, thank you.
Uh, look, Nate is a great guy, but Diana is aggressive.
And I don't know why she's back, but it's safe to say it has something to do with him.
Well, I'm not interested in competing with someone else.
Well, it's not about competing.
Even if there was no Diana, your whole "not wanting to be a part of his world" thing is not a good idea.
I mean, he's your boyfriend.
Part of being in a relationship is sharing each other's interests.
I do-- everything but parties and the Upper East Side social order.
Yeah, well, like it or not, that's a big part of his life and work.
And if you don't start meeting halfway, you leave room for someone who will, like Diana.
So what? What do I do? Try this on.
It's gorgeous, but I couldn't wow! Especially because it costs more than a semester at Julliard.
Not for us it doesn't.
You heard Tracy.
She said it's on them.
Come on.
It's one of the many perks of being an "It Girl".
Come on! Come on! We need to get out of here! Blair has the papers, but she hasn't signed them.
Now that us as a couple is a reality, maybe it's freaking her out.
Yeah, I think you're just kind of Humphrey-ing out here, man.
The editor in chief is chitchatting with his bro instead of working.
And you wonder why the paper isn't doing so well.
The most recent numbers.
Dismal.
Seriously? Diana is the only investor you could find? Yeah, well, Chuck was gonna step in, but the timing was off and, uh, he wasn't liquid enough.
Chuck Bass wasn't liquid? How is that possible? I shouldn't have even brought it up.
Why? Does, uh, does this have to do with Blair? Oh, Nate.
If Chuck did something, you gotta tell me.
Oh, it's nothing bad.
In fact, it's good.
I don't know why Chuck insists on keeping it quiet.
Well, if it's good, then what's the big deal, Nate? You, uh, you know what I'm up against here.
Come on.
All right, fine.
But you didn't hear it from me, okay? Chuck didn't have the money because he paid off Blair's dowry.
Oh, my God.
That's why she didn't sign the papers.
She must have found out, now she's having second thoughts.
Oh, he was just trying to do a nice thing for Blair.
Come on.
You really believe that? This is Chuck we're talking about.
I gotta go.
Why you lie to Mr.
Dan about signing the papers? Sneak up on me like that again, and I'm gonna start making you wear a bell.
I want answer.
Divorce is a private matter.
You'll see for yourself someday.
Now if you wanna make yourself useful, call the car around.
Only if you tell me why you don't sign the papers.
Otherwise, you take taxi.
I'm going to do it.
I just need a little more time.
For what? It--it makes no sense, but I feel like Once I sign those papers, I'm closing the door on something that I'm not quite ready to let go of.
Marriage to Louis? No.
Then what? Oh, my God.
So the entire Upper East Side is seeing this photo of me right now? Well, not just the Upper East Side.
It is the Internet.
But hey, this is exactly what we wanted.
Between that photo and the news that you are the real Charlie Rhodes, everyone will be talking about you.
Yeah, about how I'm an exhibitionist with a freak for a mom.
Oh, I just got an e-mail from Tracy at Kiki de Montparnasse.
She wants you to model at the party tonight.
No.
No, no, no.
No, that's not gonna happen.
Oh, come on.
What better way to show Nate you're willing to make more of an effort? And not to mention, Diana is one of the party sponsors.
You think Nate's gonna be going to this? Of course he will.
I shouldn't jump to any conclusions.
I should probably just go talk to him myself.
I'll let you know, okay? Um, yeah.
Sure.
Lola, I don't--I don't want to freak you out, but, um, you may wanna check "Gossip Girl" again.
Word is that Diana and Nate are going to tonight's "Down to Your Skivvies" party together.
Guess their relationship just went from business to pleasure.
I thought that I moved on, that this whole business with my mother was in the past.
I could live with the uncertainty because the woman I met, I didn't care if she was my mother or not.
Then I found out she did this extraordinary thing for me.
Is it wrong to think that changes things? No.
Of course not, but What I don't understand is what you want from me.
Just someone to talk to, I guess.
Someone who'll understand.
You--you met her.
You know what I went through.
Is it worth it to try and reach out again? I don't know, Chuck, but I'm not sure I'm the one to ask.
Why? Because of Humphrey? Blair, I'm not trying to work an angle here.
I'm simply coming to you as a friend.
No, you're not.
You're working right back into my life and you're using your mother to do it.
Blair I'm sorry if I sound harsh, but we both know we've never been good as friends.
There's always been an agenda.
Am I wrong? No, you're not wrong.
Chuck, what are you doing here? I thought I was coming to see a friend for advice.
Apparently, I made a mistake.
Well, what's going on? You know how I got that blood transfusion at the hospital? It was Elizabeth.
Apparently, she is my mother, but she's pulled a disappearing act.
I'm trying to to decide whether it's worth it to track her down, try and build a relationship.
Well, if you're asking me, I'd say do it.
I mean, I know it's scary, but when it comes to reconnecting with family, it's--it's worth the risk.
Thanks.
I'm telling you, it's not true.
Then why was it on "Gossip Girl"? I have no idea.
Why should I believe that, Nate? You already lied to me about having a relationship with Diana.
Okay, you're right.
Right? And that was dumb, and I'm really sorry about that.
But there is nothing going on right now.
Then why do you keep nervously looking at the door? Because Diana has made it clear to me that she's determined to push me out.
And the last thing I need is a fight with my girlfriend at the office.
Okay.
Well, we can discuss it tonight then.
I can't tonight.
I have to go to this party.
What? You don't even like events like this, and the only reason you wanna go is because you think I'm lying to you, and I'm not.
This is a work event, not a personal one, okay? I'm sorry.
Hey.
Is there anything you wanna tell me? Let me guess.
You saw on "Gossip Girl" that Chuck came by.
I can explain.
No, you don't have to.
I-I already know about the dowry.
What are you talking about? About how, uh, how Chuck paid your dowry.
Listen, if that's why you didn't sign the divorce papers, I just wish you would tell me.
No.
I had no idea Chuck paid it.
None.
I thought it was Georgina.
I gotta go.
Where? To find him.
"Him" who? Chuck? Hello? This is John Rosen, Ivy Dickens' lawyer.
My client got a call from a bank officer, informing her that there was a cashier's check waiting for her? Yes, my, uh, wife unfroze the assets.
That's what Ivy thought.
So she packed up, left her keys, and went to go get the check.
But when she got to the bank, they had no idea what she was talking about.
I couldn't help but overhear your little lover's spat.
I'm sorry Lola won't be coming tonight, but maybe it presents an opportunity.
What if you and I went together? Well, I appreciate the olive branch, but I think it sends the wrong message.
Lola's still my girlfriend, and I don't want to hurt her.
You and I know it's just business.
What's the risk? What's the point? It looks good to advertisers, us playing nice.
Let's use this night to send a message to the town that "The Spectator" is back to being a well-oiled machine.
Hey! So Nate swears there's nothing going on with Diana, but he also refuses to bring me as his date tonight.
I'm sorry.
Well you just have two options, then.
Well, there's stay home and do nothing, or you could come with me to the party and you model.
Tell Tracy I'll be there, with a date.
Diana better watch out.
I'm ready.
Everyone's been talking about Manhattan's latest arrival, Lola Rhodes.
And word is that tonight you're going to see a whole lot more of her.
Hey.
They do not have parties like this in Florida.
They barely have dental hygiene in Florida.
Ooh, open bar.
Be right back.
Hey, nice touch with the hot guy.
Oh, thanks.
So have you seen him yet? Hello! How are you? Okay, don't tell me they're not on a date.
And she's even more beautiful in person.
That's annoying.
Don't worry.
As soon as she sees you model, she's not only gonna see you're a force to be reckoned with and back off, but you and Nate will be the hottest couple on the party circuit.
You will surpass me as New York's "It Girl" in no time.
Oh, no, Serena, no one could surpass you, especially not me.
Yes, you can, and you will.
And believe me, nothing would make me happier.
Come on.
Let's go find Tracy so we can start getting ready.
Actually, I think I'm gonna introduce myself to Diana first.
Thanks.
Go for it.
Good luck.
Hey, Nate.
You remember Aidan.
Yeah, w-what are you doing here? Careful, Nate.
You don't want to cause a scene.
This is a business party, after all.
Hi.
I'm Lola Rhodes.
I don't think we've ever met.
Um, this is my date, Aidan Hill.
Oh.
It's a pleasure.
I'm surprised to see you, Lola.
Nate said you wouldn't be making it.
Actually, I was invited to model tonight.
What? I-I didn't know that.
Well, why would you? It's not like we were coming together.
Maybe Diana and I should, uh, get a drink while you two talk.
Actually, Nate and I need to go and say hello to a few people.
Lola, maybe it's time for you to show Aidan what you're modeling tonight.
Otherwise, you might lose two men to me in one day.
I brought lattes to help us pack.
I heard from Ivy's lawyer.
She got a call from the bank, saying there was a cashier's check waiting for her.
So she packed up and moved out, and when she went to collect it, it wasn't there.
Do you know anything about this? Yes, I never called the lawyers.
But now that she's out, I need to legally make sure she can't get back in.
And the call about the check? It was a ruse to get her out of the apartment.
Rufus, you're not gonna get me to feel any remorse about this.
Ivy lied about who she was, she manipulated my mother while she lay dying, and she stole our apartment.
Look, frankly, I think she deserves exactly what she's getting.
But you didn't just lie to her.
You lied to me.
But, Rufus, I'm sorry I kept it from you, because I knew you wouldn't be comfortable with it.
I had to protect you from the truth.
This isn't what a marriage is, Lily.
We have to be honest with each other.
I know, but this was an extreme situation.
I did what had to be done.
You know, maybe I'm just seeing more clearly because of the view from Brooklyn, but I'm not okay with this.
Look, Rufus, I know you're upset, but how can you be so righteous? We're talking about someone that stole from us.
Oh, my God.
Can we please just Stop fighting and just pack and go home? Yeah, I don't know, Lil.
Right now this loft feels a lot more like home than our apartment.
As you can see, Nate, everyone's very excited I'm back.
No one more so than you, apparently.
Which makes me wonder-- It's a buyer's market right now for newspapers.
If you really wanted one, you could've gone anywhere.
What are you getting at? I think you came back for me.
Oh! You're adorable.
Oh, I'm serious.
I bet you spent the last few months in L.
A.
, trying to convince yourself that I was nothing, just a fling with a younger guy.
But the fact is, you couldn't get over me.
Really? Then explain this.
Come with me.
Where's my date going? Exactly where we want him to.
Blair, what are you doing here? Looking for you.
At first, I wasn't sure I could find you, but then I realized all I had to do was look for the lingerie models.
So tell me, is it true? Did you pay my dowry? Who told you that? Tell me if it's true.
W-why does it matter? I knew it.
You thought you could buy me back, just like you thought you could sell me for your hotel.
You've got it all wrong.
That's why you showed up with that ruse today about friendship.
You bought my divorce and you came to collect your prize.
Then why didn't I collect? I swear, I did not want you to know about the dowry.
The only people that knew were Nate and Andrew Tyler.
I just wanted you to be free.
Whom you choose to love with that freedom is up to you.
I'm sorry, Blair.
I thought you knew.
Oh! You're right.
He's a good actor.
Yeah, I don't think he's acting all that much.
Wait, you two are working together? W--is this some kind of revenge on Diana? Yes, but let me explain it to you.
I I can't believe this.
You? Whatever.
But, Lola You totally used me.
Just go talk to her.
We got what we needed, all right? Uh-oh, Nate.
Looks like your dirty movie just got an unhappy ending.
What the hell do you think you're doing? Filming you and Aidan.
Oh, and he's 16, by the way.
Not sure how you're gonna run "The Spectator" from jail.
And you recorded it? Yep.
You have not lost your touch, by the way.
So what do you think-- the front page of "The Spectator" or just let Gossip Girl run with it? Go ahead.
Send the video wherever you want.
If what's-his-name really is 16, you'll be in prison right there next to me for recording and distributing child pornography.
I'm gonna go enjoy the show.
See you at work tomorrow.
So, uh Are you okay? Yeah.
I guess I'm just not used to seeing Chuck do anything selfless.
Yeah, well, people can surprise us, even Chuck.
I saw the divorce papers.
The seal was there, but they weren't signed.
I thought you must've known that he paid the dowry.
No.
This has nothing to do with Chuck or the dowry.
Well, then--then why? My whole life, I wanted to be a princess.
And when I met Louis, it was This whole whirlwind of royalty and tiaras, and it seemed like my dream was coming true.
I mean, I may have married a prince, but I never really got to be a princess.
I know it's silly, but I think it was just one more loss I needed to mourn before moving on.
Serena, when I first came to you, it was because I needed advice and I wanted yours.
Oh, and when you agreed to come with me to the party? That was Because I needed to make it look like I was in a fight with Nate in front of Diana.
I know you really want this "It Girl" title for me, and I'm so flattered that you think I could ever live up to it, but to be honest with you, Serena, I-I don't care about that kind of thing.
And neither does Nate, so I'm so sorry and I hope we can still be friends.
Well, why would I want to be? I put myself on the line for you, Lola, and then all you did was let me down.
Okay, ladies, time to get in position.
There's just been a small change in the plans.
Yeah, Lola's not modeling.
What? She can explain.
Uh, Serena, I need to talk to you.
Oh, I'm so sorry about Lola.
I know it's an inconvenience.
It's not that.
After that photograph came out today, we thought we'd get even more buzz if we changed the name of "The Serena" to "The Lola.
" So I need you to model something else.
Seriously? I mean, a few minutes ago, that would've been great news.
But now you asked me to do this.
I have a model to take your place while you go change.
We'd love to see you in something else.
Sorry, but you can't go out there.
We can't have Serena being the face of "The Lola.
" Please, come with me.
Spotted-- Serena Van Der Woodsen blowing off the Kiki fashion show.
Looks like this party just went from so hot to so not.
Hey.
I just wanted to let you know how sorry I am about last night.
And I really appreciate everything you were doing with the whole "It Girl" thing.
No, it's okay.
I-I-I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have pushed you to do it.
It's clearly not for you.
Actually, it might be.
I got a call from an agent this morning.
She saw my photo on "Gossip Girl" and wants to set up a meeting with me.
What does, um, what does Nate have to say about it? I thought he didn't care about you being an "It Girl.
" Yeah, I know.
He doesn't, but, um He's supportive of my acting career, so he's happy.
And anyway, it's how you use your power that counts, right? Sure.
How do you plan to use yours? Well, I was thinking that, instead of being an "It Girl" like you-- beautiful and unobtainable-- that maybe I could be more of an "every girl", you know, like, someone everyone can relate to.
I don't know.
Maybe that's dumb.
Is that stupid? No.
No, no, I no, I just think, you know, these things usually come and go pretty quickly.
So I just--I wouldn't get too used to it, you know? But, um, there are some things that I have to do, so maybe I can call you later, and we can hang out? Okay.
Yeah.
Can we talk? Sure.
I don't think I realized just how upset you were with me till last night.
Or how much you were willing to fight for "The Spectator.
" I've been putting my heart and soul into this paper.
Of course I'm gonna fight for it.
I'd like us to find a way to work together.
Well, I don't know how to do that anymore.
Well I could apologize, for starters, for not being honest with you from the very beginning about being in business with your grandfather.
It was a terrible thing to do to you.
Thank you.
Is that it? Well, I could apologize for last night.
But I thought that was a draw.
What about all the "Gossip Girl" sources you released? I didn't do that.
I thought you would've found out by now.
After your grandfather intervened, it was all over.
I thought it would be easier for you to hate me.
And frankly, I-I think I wanted to punish myself a little for what I did to you.
So About us working together-- What's that gonna look like? "The Spectator" is yours.
I'm just here in a support capacity.
In the meantime, I have some other business I need to take care of, and that's gonna be my main focus.
And I found another office downstairs.
Deal? Deal.
There's one more thing I should come clean about.
You were right about me still having feelings for you.
I know you're with Lola now, and I promise I won't let my feelings get in the way of your relationship or of our work.
Let me know if you need me.
Always good to see you, but you really didn't need to come all the way to the mark to meet me, Andrew.
You could've just e-mailed me Elizabeth's information.
That's why I came.
I don't think you should contact her, Chuck.
Look, I appreciate you looking out for me, but I've decided I wanna try and have a relationship with my mother.
That's the thing.
Elizabeth is not your mother.
I made contact.
She swore it wasn't her who donated the blood.
Said she was in a monastery in Tibet at the time.
A monastery? She's lying.
She's good at that.
I looked into it.
Her story checks out.
Keep looking.
Someone donated that blood.
I wanna know who.
What is this about? The sun hasn't set.
I feel like a prom queen doing the walk of shame.
You look like a princess.
Now I'm not gonna lie.
This is cubic zirconia that I got from a costume shop.
But you'll sell it.
Cubic zirconia does not touch this body.
Put it on, Blair.
I have hit rock bottom.
What is going on? I, uh, I thought you should get to feel like a princess one last time.
O.
M.
G.
! It's Blair Waldorf! You look beautiful! She's a real-life princess! Let's get a picture with her! Please.
Here! Yeah! Absolutely.
All right.
Everybody, smile! Smile bigger! I love your crown! So amazing! We love you! Thank you! Bye! Thank you.
It turns out that Lola staged that photo of herself in a fireman's jacket.
How desperate.
Doesn't she realize there can only be one "It Girl" for the Upper East Side? And that will always be Serena Van Der Woodsen.
Nate Archibald's office, please.
He's not available right now.
Tell him it's Lola.
He's in with Diana.
He asked not to be disturbed.
Hey, Lola! Can we get a picture? Look this way, please! Come on, Lola.
Look this way.
There you go.
Nice.
You must be happy to be home.
Um, very much, Vanya.
Thank you.
I will go back down and get Mr.
Humphrey's bags.
Well, um, actually, this is it for now.
Sometimes, we fight for something only to discover by the time we get it, our goals have changed.
For some, it's too late.
The lines have been drawn And the damage has been done.
But other times you get the thing you always wanted Only to find out it isn't what you really need.
Get ready, kids.
I'm back, and this time, I'm here to stay.
X.
O.

, Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
It's time to pass the "Gossip Girl" baton.
"Welcome to your future as Gossip Girl 3.
0.
The power is now in your hands.
" I told Chuck he doesn't have my heart anymore.
I realized it belongs to someone else.
"As for the rest of my estate, I leave to you, Ivy Dickens.
" I think it'd be best if you left.
I was just gonna say the same thing.
This is my apartment now.
I heard from Ivy's lawyer.
She got a call from the bank saying there was a cashier's check waiting for her.
Do you know anything about this? It was a ruse to get her out of the apartment.
But you didn't just lie to her.
You lied to me.
I will go back down and get Mr.
Humphrey's bags.
Well, um, actually, this is it for now.
I'm ready to move on with my life, and I can't do that with Gossip Girl tracking my every move.
Find a new Serena.
Use your influence to anoint her the new "it" girl.
Please tell me we have an offer that will at least keep "The Spectator" afloat.
Yes, I do know Diana Payne.
"The Spectator" is yours.
I'm just here in a support capacity.
Deal? Deal.
They needed a family member for a blood transfusion, and I gave the doctors Jack's number.
Jack? You're covering for who really gave me the blood-- Elizabeth.
She didn't want you to know.
Elizabeth is not your mother.
Keep looking.
Someone donated that blood.
I wanna know who.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.
O.

O.
, Gossip Girl.
Even on the Upper East Side, the laws of physics dictate that what goes up must come down.
Even when it feels as if our feet are a million miles off the ground.
But when we've hit rock bottom, we hope that some way, somehow, our fortunes will change That a great force will reverse the trend.
Hey.
Sorry.
Did I wake you? It's after 9:00.
Yeah, that's dawn on the Upper East Side.
What's going on? Well, remember how I called "Page Six" and Perez Hilton "trash-filled rags for small-minded individuals"? Yeah, I think I recall something along those lines.
Well, I take it back.
Sort of.
I still think gossip sites are demonic, but even I have to admit that this whole "it" girl thing has its perks.
Oh, really? Like what? Like Lars Von trier requesting me for an audition? He's doing a staging of "Dancer in the Dark" at the public.
No big whoop.
I mean, he's only a bona fide film God.
That's fantastic.
When are we gonna celebrate? I mean, I'm free right now.
How about after my audition? It's today, and so I need every waking moment to prepare, which includes tracking down Serena and getting her advice on what to wear for my debut.
Actually, she's been kind of distant lately.
I can't figure out why.
Listen, just 'cause you're cousins doesn't mean you have to be best friends.
My cousin tried to kill me.
Okay, I gotta go.
Talk soon.
We have a very busy day ahead of us, so try to look alive.
We begin with-- just how lonely boy like-- over easy with croissant on side.
Jam with four fruits, not plain strawberry.
Thank you, Dorota.
You know me so well.
As I was saying, or at least attempting to say before you two started chatting about condiments, we will be walking the red carpet at opening night of "End of the Rainbow" tonight-- our first public outing as a couple.
So I'm scheduled for a photo facial at 10:00, and then Tracy Anderson will be twisting my body into positions you couldn't even imagine at 11:00.
In the meantime, why don't you go home and shower? Or not shower and just use deodorant as people from Brooklyn are wont to do.
We'll grab cocktails before curtain, 7:00 P.
M.
, where the red carpet, paparazzi, and at least one stirring tale of alcoholism and financial ruin await us.
God.
It's good to be back in the saddle.
Sounds like a perfect plan.
Of course it is.
I came up with it.
So be on time.
Are you sure it's okay if I borrow it? Of course.
You have to wear the perfect thing, not just for the audition, but for all the people that will be writing about you going to it.
You know, it's funny, the only person who seems to not be writing about you these days is Gossip Girl.
Hmm.
That doesn't bother me.
Really? I mean, she is the crown jewel of the New York gossip blogs.
Maybe when you were in high school, but now it seems like she's kind of irrelevant.
Oh, be careful what you say.
She might be able to hear you.
This is the biggest audition of my life.
Last thing I'm worried about is some pathetic blogger in a dark room tethered to a computer.
So are you nervous? Petrified.
Von Trier's a genius, but he's got a reputation for being really tough on actresses.
Personally, I think directors wield a little bit too much power, so even if he's tough, no tears from me.
Well, you seem so confident today, that nothing could make you cry, even if it should.
Uh, well, thank you so much for this dress, Serena.
I really appreciate it.
Of course.
Break a leg.
Thanks.
Hmm.
What's with the tie? Oh, it's a-- it's a Blair thing.
I find it's best to pick my battles.
What's with the tool belt? Oh, it's a handyman thing.
I can see that, and as happy as I am to have a chair that finally rolls, uh, don't you think it's time for you to head home? I am home.
No, I mean your other home-- the one with your wife in it.
Usually, you two are the king and queen of reconciliation.
Shouldn't you be forgiving each other right now in the midst of a teary embrace? I know.
I don't know how I let things get so out of hand.
Fix 'em, like the chair.
It's not that simple.
I feel as though Lily and I have stopped being honest with each other.
So tell her the truth.
Well, that's the thing.
I I'm not sure that I haven't been lying this whole time to myself as much as to her.
I mean, when Lily and I first got married, I threw myself into her world.
I became a plus one at her galas and in life.
But in the process, I lost myself and what's important to me.
We never managed to build a life together that included both of us.
And I'm tired of it.
But now you're living separately, stuck in a stalemate.
That isn't exactly the ideal alternative.
Yeah, but at least I'm regaining my identity.
I know you're happy with Blair, and maybe in time, you'll learn to love wearing this tie.
But don't lose sight of yourself.
Good morning.
Late because of Lola, I presume? I wish.
Trouble in paradise? I hope it isn't me.
It isn't.
Good, 'cause that was a lie.
I hope it is me.
Ooh, I've got a smile.
Watch out.
I may take it the wrong way.
Could be trouble.
Oh, yeah, yeah, go ahead and pile it on.
No, there's just a lot going on right now.
My girlfriend is totally caught up in her new life.
Serena and I are not on good terms.
I haven't seen Dan in forever.
My best friend's on a mission that I know is only gonna get him hurt.
Chuck's on a mission? Yeah, he's looking for a missing relative.
And if you have to look that hard, it's never the answer you wanna find.
You know, I better run.
I'm gonna be late for my 11:00.
Jack, it's me.
I just heard from Nate that Chuck's still on the hunt.
We have to stop him snooping around, or sooner or later, he's going to find out the truth.
Hang on.
Serena is holding my site hostage.
If you don't get it back for me, I'll tell everyone the secret that made you afraid of me in the first place.
Hello.
I'm Lola Rhodes.
I'm here to read for the part of-- Your audition has been canceled.
What? No, I got a call yesterday.
There must be some mistake.
I don't understand.
Oh, maybe this "Gossip Girl" blast will help clarify it for you.
Lola is a diva.
Wannabe actress Lola Rhodes was overhead bragging, "Everyone knows the star's the thing.
"Real actors don't take direction.
Some are just better at pretending they do.
" You can go.
Rufus? It seems I've made too much salad.
Fine.
I, uh, I had it delivered, but it's a generous serving, enough for two, and I just happened to find myself in this neighborhood, and I thought you might like some leftovers.
You just happened to find yourself in this neighborhood? I may have ordered a car with no other destination than this one.
Please, take it.
I will eat your roughage, but we both know that's not why you're here.
Why can't you just admit you wanted to see me? Okay, fine.
I missed you.
I said it.
Rufus, the Upper East Side holds all the comforts I desire-- clean sidewalks, Bergdorf Goodman, and people whose job it is to open doors.
But there is no you.
And you're the only comfort I really need.
And the apartment just It just doesn't seem like a home without you in it.
And in my abundance of time alone this week, I had a chance to think, what would you say to me selling the apartment and us finding our own place-- one that fits us both? Really? You'd do that? You love that apartment.
I like that apartment a lot, but I love you.
And I want us to work.
Me, too.
So were you a hit? Hardly.
A nasty "Gossip Girl" blast landed before I did.
I didn't even get a chance to read.
You know, I really don't get it.
She's radio silent and then decides to go after me on the most important day of my life? Yeah.
Pfft.
I don't know.
Gossip Girl works in mysterious ways.
I guess she isn't so irrelevant after all, huh? Hey You didn't happen to mention anything about our conversation about Lars Von Trier, did you? I mean, not that I even said anything bad, but-- No, not--not a word.
Okay.
Well, I guess I'll just act like I'm not totally mortified and try and get on with my life.
Hopefully, this is the last I'm hearing from her.
Yeah, hopefully.
I'll talk to you later.
Isn't it exciting? Finally meeting the infamous Gossip Girl in the flesh.
Hi.
How many? Hi.
Two, please.
Thanks.
Why did we have to come all the way out here lunch? Actually, I was hoping we could go next door to the Community Garden.
They're having a tree-planting event.
My friend Alexis is covering it for McSweeney's, so she wanted to grab a photo of us going green.
What? No.
Just because a tree grows in Brooklyn does not mean I have to plant it.
I'm not going green.
I'm going home.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Look, we can't be photographed.
We are coming out tonight as a couple at the theater.
So we can come out now in Brooklyn and then uptown later.
I mean, it's--it's the best of both worlds.
Dan, a couple only has one chance to make a first impression on the world, and I'm not doing it knee-deep in fertilizer looking like Vanessa whatshername.
Look, Blair, I'm not trying to be difficult, but I don't wanna just melt into your world and lose myself completely.
We need a balance.
But I just spent the last year of my life playing Marie Antoinette to Prince Possessive.
I'm not going from Habsburg to Williamsburg.
I wanna be me.
And I wanna be me.
I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to eavesdrop, but we couldn't help but overhear your argument.
We've had the same fight over a million times.
I'm die-hard Upper East Side.
And I'm as Queens as acrylic nails.
So we know a thing or two about settling our differences.
Wait.
It's you.
You're Julian Tepper, and you're Jenna Gribbon.
You're like the Brangelina of the five boroughs.
How you doing? Hi.
I'm Blair Waldorf.
Dan.
Jenna.
Dan.
So how did you find a solution? What was your compromise? Well, that's a long story.
Well, we have time.
Lunch? I'm sorry about your audition.
I know how badly you wanted the part.
You'll get the next one, okay? Have you ever wondered who Gossip Girl actually is? Like, have you ever tried to find her? Yeah, of course.
You know, but she keeps her identity pretty well hidden.
I have a theory--Serena.
Serena what? Serena is Gossip Girl.
There's no use denying it.
I know you're the acting Queen of Cyberspace.
I also know that the real Gossip Girl has been badgering you to return her site.
I should warn you that she's prepared to go to great lengths to get what she wants, but this doesn't matter, because I want to help you stay on as Gossip Girl.
I want to protect your identity and help you keep the site.
Lola, that's ludicrous.
Serena's hated Gossip Girl since we were freshmen in high school.
I mean, you can read for yourself all the negative posts about her.
Well, of course Gossip Girl has to slam Serena sometimes.
It'd be pretty obvious if she didn't.
Why would you wanna help me? Maybe I'll be helping myself, too.
If you remember, I have a history with Gossip Girl.
Well, a history with Gossip Girl means you have something to hide.
I'm a woman who has lived.
I have plenty to hide.
But if you continue your reign as Gossip Girl, we both win.
Well, so far you've only told me how you do.
Lola, look, I know you're an actress, and there's a certain amount of quirkiness that I'm supposed to find charming, but this is too much.
You have to stop letting your imagination run wild.
Come on.
We have a reservation at Masa in 15 minutes.
Actually, I don't think I can go.
I have to fix the situation with my audition.
I have a great deal of influence in New York media.
I'll make sure that your version of "Gossip Girl" is the most popular web site in town.
I'm sorry, Nate.
Wait.
So what are you gonna do, call the director? Or just spend the whole afternoon obsessing about conspiracy theories? Seriously, Lola, it needs to stop.
I have to think about it.
Don't take too long.
Serena's Gossip Girl.
Just wait.
I'm gonna prove it to you.
I'll be at "The Spectator" after lunch.
You can give me your answer then.
Happy blogging.
And that is the story of how I got Julian and his Prada loafers to Astoria.
And now I love pork buns.
Who knew? Well, thank you for having lunch with us.
You've really given us hope.
Well, meals are easier to negotiate, but what about your social life? Actually, every month we host a salon.
Good food, good wine.
Intellectual discussion.
Not to brag, but people fight for invites.
You should come.
Agyness Deyn and Sara Sophie Flicker came to the last one, and Mario Carbone and Rich Torrisi did the menu, and then we screened "My Man Godfrey.
" Carole Lombard is my spirit animal.
We'll absolutely be at the next one.
Guys, this has been fun, but we've gotta go.
Nice meeting you.
Nice to meet you, too.
Very nice to meet you.
Dan.
Yeah.
I thought they were cute.
I wonder if it'll last.
To be transported back to the vicious circle.
It's so romantic and--and so au courant, so-- it's the perfect combination of you and me.
It's as if the Angelika was on 75th Street.
Let's forget the garden and the theater and just host a salon for our official coming out.
Its only fault is that I didn't think of it myself.
Come on! We have planning to do.
Yeah, I like that one.
Just tell him to put it in color, please.
Thanks.
Hey, have you seen Diana? Uh, yeah, she's downstairs, in her office.
So are we still in a fight? Uh, well, you did fire me, but, um, it actually turned out for the best.
I don't know about you, but I'd really like to put it behind us.
Yeah, me, too.
So what's new in your life? Uh, recently, I've had my hands full with your long-lost cousin.
What do you mean? Ever since Lola hit the "it" girl radar, she's been completely M.
I.
A.
, and I didn't think she was the type of girl to get caught up in it, but today there was this "Gossip Girl" blast about her, and she just kinda lost it-- All worked up, theories about who Gossip Girl is.
Well, who does she think it is? You, actually.
What? Yeah.
That's insane.
What have I ever done to her? No, I know.
It's crazy.
She's just upset her audition, looking for someone to blame.
Well, tell her not to look at me.
I really hope this ride doesn't change her.
I mean, she was such a sweet girl.
Hey, it was, um, good to talk to you.
I'm--I'm gonna go find Diana.
Yeah, you, too.
Good news, Jack.
I'm about to make a deal with Serena, and as long as she controls the "Gossip Girl" web site, no one will ever find out what I did for Chuck at the hospital.
Uh-oh, Diana.
Bye.
Looks like mischief is written into your D.
N.
A.
Okay, now that takes care of the flowers.
What glasses shall we use? Mason jars.
There is something to be said about that whole farm-to-table phenom.
Uh, wine? French.
Theme? Well, I have a thing for Du Maurier, and you hanker for T.
S.
Eliot.
We both love Radiohead.
"London Calling"-- An ode to the Brits.
It's perfect.
April Bloomfield will cater.
I do secretly love pub food when it's made with foie.
Who--who to invite? Serena? I-I really want us to have a chance at being successful tonight.
If she's there, we'll both be on edge.
So I think we should just wait till we have our footing.
Nate? At a salon? I'm not even gonna dignify that with a response.
Well, since we're breaking new ground together, why don't we bring some new people into the mix? Like, uh, how about our new couple friends? Well, they do qualify as influencers.
Approved.
And what about Diana Payne? She's British, and she's press.
If she writes about tonight, our new world will be the hottest destination in New York.
Oh, okay, Vanya.
I see you tonight.
Big kisses to you and Ana and Leo.
Mwah, mwah, mwah.
Hey, Dorota.
I'm here looking for Serena.
Have you seen her? Oh, miss Serena hiding in room all day long like blonde Unabomber.
You know the best part of this guest list? No "Gossip Girl" moles.
I mean, can you imagine an entire night without having to worry about embarrassing online photos or snarky e-blasts? And since we're gonna be surrounded by New York literati and Brooklyn's literati, it's the perfect opportunity for you to announce your second book.
You think that's a good idea? We'll be making our debut as a couple, and you can reclaim your place as the most important young writer in New York City.
Of course I think it's a good idea.
Vanya, Mr.
Humphrey will be back shortly, and he'll have some bags with him if you could help him upstairs.
I will be so happy to have Mr.
Humphrey back.
I haven't heard any great guitar riffs through the wall lately.
Oh! Here.
Thank you.
Hello? Rufus Humphrey, please.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Uh, my husband's not here at the moment.
He should be home in an hour or so.
This is the front desk at the Soho Grand.
I'm just calling to verify his credit card information.
Oh, I can do that.
What is he paying for? The stay of a hotel guest-- Ivy Dickens.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm-- I absolutely cannot verify that card.
Certainly not to pay for Ivy Dickens.
Okay.
Uh, thank you for your time.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Weren't you working the night that Chuck Bass was brought into the hospital? Yes.
I remember that night well.
Do you happen to recognize this woman? Yes.
She arrived at the hospital the night of the accident.
She donated blood and left quickly before Mr.
Bass regained consciousness.
Thank you so much.
You've been a huge help.
Sure.
Hi.
This is Serena Van Der Woodsen, calling for Ms.
Payne.
I'm sorry.
She's not available at the moment.
Would you like to leave a message? Uh, do you know where I might find her? I need to speak with her immediately.
I-I have a lead on a story that I know she'll wanna break before the "Daily News".
Okay, uh, just a second.
She'll be attending the salon at Daniel Humphrey's this evening.
It's located at-- Yeah, okay, I got it.
Thank you.
I know you're mad at me, but if you'll just meet me at Dan's, I have proof that Serena is Gossip Girl.
Fine, but only on the condition that if your so-called proof comes up short, you'll agree to drop this once and for all.
Yes, absolutely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
You won't regret it.
All right.
See you soon.
Any interest in, uh, taking a little field trip out to the 7-1-8? Sure.
I haven't been slumming in a while.
Seems New York's newest intellectuals are about to get dumbed down.
Welcome, everybody.
Tonight is about wit and wisdom and discussion.
Our theme of the evening, as you know, is all things British.
And our menu, prepared by chef April Bloomfield, takes its inspiration from that theme.
So as each new dish is served, a new topic of discussion will be introduced.
Food service will begin momentarily, but until then, Dan and I are so pleased to be hosting you.
Cheerio! Here, here! Sorry I'm late.
Late? How can you be late to an event you didn't even know was happening? What are you doing here? In the madness of planning this soiree, you must have forgotten to invite me.
But it's okay.
Don't stop on account of me.
I'll just make myself at home.
Um, the first course is a lovely combination of Look, it's Lola.
I'm wearing the Lola.
Wait, you invited her? Yes.
No.
Talk amongst yourselves.
Dan and I will be back in a London minute.
I am trying to maintain a stiff British upper lip, but how can I keep calm and carry on with those two here? Serena will spend the whole night judging us, and Lola is probably just trying to squeeze every last drop of free press out of the night so she can move on from the community theater circuit.
Blair, our salon can easily handle a few party crashers.
And besides, you should be at least a little flattered that they both made it all the way to Brooklyn to check it out.
Look Tonight is gonna be great.
Deal?
Deal.
Isn't this exciting, Dan making his big book announcement tonight?
Hey, wasn't it Gossip Girl who first broke the news about "Inside"?
I think so.
Do you think she'll break the news about the sequel tonight, or will someone else beat her to the punch? I mean, there are a lot of media types here.
Of course, maybe Gossip Girl is here, too.
In which case, she doesn't have to worry.
Gossip Girl doesn't need to travel to get her news.
She's got sources everywhere.
Really? Even at a party like this? I mean look around.
Who would be sending Gossip Girl tips? Well, all I'm saying is that this book party is a pretty big deal.
I think Gossip Girl would have to post about it to stay relevant.
Look, I understand Gossip Girl's probably pretty fascinating to a newcomer like you, but to me, she's just not.
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go rejoin the other guests.
What are you doing here? I'm not sure.
Nate invited me.
What are we doing here? Well, Lola invited us.
Hi, hi, hi.
Where do you get off inviting people to my salon? Explain yourself.
Yes, Lola, I think an explanation's in order.
Nate, listen to me.
Blair, leave it.
I know you think I've completely lost it, but I'm about to prove to you once and for all that Serena is Gossip Girl.
But what if you're wrong? I'm not.
Serena crashed this party because she heard that Dan was gonna announce the topic of his second book, and I promise you that 30 seconds later, it's gonna be all over "Gossip Girl.
" Yeah, well, that doesn't prove anything.
I mean, anyone here could send in a tip, including Dan.
Fine.
I have a better idea.
Wait, Lola-- No.
I'll show you.
Trust me.
So, Mr.
Humphrey, how you like new magnetic fields? I love it.
Hey, Lil.
Can you just leave these here? Thank you.
Have you secretly been putting Ivy Dickens up in a hotel? Yes, I have.
You left her penniless, I'm the one who convinced her to move out.
I felt responsible, couldn't let her live on the street.
Why not? She's a thief.
That's exactly where she belongs.
She's a young girl.
She has nothing.
She has no family, no friends.
No money.
I could care less about Ivy, which you well know.
How could you help this girl Lily, you have to under-- After what she did to our family? I did what I thought was right.
With my money.
I used my own personal credit card.
At least now I know how you really feel.
This is clearly a much bigger issue.
Entrees are almost ready, but I've ran out of ice, and I need the ice to finish off my dessert and my special cocktail.
I think Meryl Streep was a perfect In the world of the novel, London has become the very idea of the big city.
I need to speak with you.
Excuse me.
Graham Greene.
Martin Amis.
Discuss.
Okay, don't freak out, but since everybody's crashing, April's running short on ice.
We need to run out and get some more, so dinner's gonna be delayed.
How long? No.
You know what? We can handle this.
W.
W.
D.
P.
D.
? Mm? What would Dorothy Parker do? Uh, get them drunk until we get back.
Of course.
A-a liquid diet of booze and great intellectual discussion should suffice.
Can I top off anyone's wine? Nothing gets conversation flowing like a good red.
Dan, why are we discussing British literary figures when we have New York's most celebrated author in our midst? An author with an announcement, perhaps? Good evening, everyone.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, Diana.
Just the person I was hoping to see.
Do--do you have a moment to speak privately? Sure.
And we're off to get the ice.
So I'm assuming you have an answer for me.
What do you say? Me and my resources plus Gossip Girl is a powerful combination.
Well, I don't know.
Usually when I enter into a partnership with someone, I-I like to know everything about them.
I-I think they call that vetting? Vet away, darling.
Well, I just have a couple questions.
Like, where were you the night of Chuck's accident, November 18th? I was I was here in New York.
And do you happen to know where he was treated for his injuries? Or his blood type? Do you know the date he was born or where you were on that date? I know what you're getting at.
Well, if you know what I'm getting at, then why don't you answer for me? Or would you like me to do that? What do you want me to say? The nurse recognized you.
You saved Chuck's life.
And you did that because I'm Chuck's mother.
If you want my advice, it's run, Lola, run, 'cause you just let out the mother of all secrets.
Is it true? Yes, Charles, it is.
Don't.
Just stay right there.
You have been in New York for months, inviting me to parties, hiring my friends, hanging out in my apartment in your underwear, banging my best friend.
Did it not occur to you to mention this, that you were my mother?! Please, Chuck, I can explain.
I-I can't do this right now or ever.
I can't.
Well, this is the most dramatic salon I've ever been to.
Very unbritish, if you ask me.
I hope you're pleased with yourself.
I was right all along.
You're actually her.
You're Gossip Girl.
Even if I am, it doesn't matter.
Do you realize the damage that you've just done? You had no right to do that.
Who wants another Pimm's Cup? Wait.
What happened here? Where's everyone going? That was more soap opera than salon.
This never would've happened at the Oracle Club.
This was supposed to be our coming out party.
It was supposed to capture who we are as a couple, but it wasn't smart or interesting.
It wasn't uptown or downtown.
It was a bloody mess.
Blair, it was-- it was just a party.
No, it wasn't.
We tried to create a new world for our relationship to exist in, but we failed miserably.
You don't want to live in my world, and I certainly don't want to live in yours.
So where does that leave us? I don't know.
I'm genuinely sorry that I hurt Chuck today.
I'm not sorry I hurt you.
Here's your coat, sir.
Please, whatever you do, just don't tell anyone what you know.
Nate, wait.
Where are you going? I need to find Chuck and make sure he's all right.
I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.
I told you to leave things alone.
It's one thing to accuse Serena of being Gossip Girl.
But sending in that video about Chuck? I can't forgive that.
I mean, do you have anything to say for yourself? No.
Thank you.
The Brits say "God save the Queen.
" But it looks like Lola is the one in need of a royal S.
O.
S.
Nate, I need to speak with you and Chuck.
We don't have anything to say to you.
You need to go now.
It's okay.
I may be angry, but I need to know the truth.
You running away? No.
Joining the army? Auditioning for one of those "America's Got Idol Talent Factor" shows? I was hoping I could have a sleepover with you.
You do realize that means you'd be entering my world.
I do.
Our relationship is not choosing one world or another.
Our relationship is our world.
Well, then tonight our relationship was a world-wide disaster.
It's probably not gonna be our last, but we have to face these disasters together.
We're a team.
So maybe we can be a team at the met ball? Absolutely.
And, uh, at a beet pickling festival.
Mmm.
You know I wouldn't be caught dead at a beet pickling festival? I'm just messing with you.
I met your father when he was still with Elizabeth.
I was very young.
I couldn't resist him.
He was charming, handsome.
It felt as if he had the whole world at his feet.
I knew he was involved with someone else.
You mean married.
Yeah.
We had an affair, and it only ended when I got pregnant.
But you kept the baby.
You must have wanted me.
I mean, why did you give me up? I was a mess.
Mixed up in the wrong things with the wrong people.
Unfit to raise a child.
And then Elizabeth-- she couldn't get pregnant.
It seemed like a way to solve all our problems.
So you made a deal.
After it was over, I left town, alone and ashamed.
But a few years later, when I heard that Elizabeth had died, although I now know that wasn't the case, I came back.
But Elizabeth couldn't do it.
She couldn't stick to her end of the bargain, to raise someone else's child as her own.
I wanted to see you desperately.
But Bart thought it would be too confusing for you.
So you just stayed away until eight months ago? When I came back to the city last fall, I was hoping to watch over you from afar.
Nate's bed is not that far.
Well, I didn't intend for things to get as serious as they did with Nate.
And then I thought, if you never find out the truth, what's the harm? So what does it all mean Now that I know? That's for you to decide.
You know where to find me.
Haven't you stirred up enough trouble for one night? I came to return this.
Why didn't you tell Nate when you had the chance? Because I knew it would hurt him if he found out.
You're one of his best friends.
Even when you guys are mad at each other, he still cares about you.
I couldn't ruin Chuck's life and Nate's in the same night.
Can I just ask why? Why do you do it? I only became Gossip Girl recently, and--and right now it's the only thing I have.
I mean, it's--it's the only thing in my life that I can hold on to, you know, because a lot of times my life is just really out of control.
Well, I get that, but you're doing exactly what was done to you and to everyone else.
Yeah.
I mean, I was hurt, sure, but I survived.
A little adversity can actually be good for you.
You'll see how things work around here.
No, I won't, actually.
I'm officially resigning from the Upper East Side.
I have a whole life at Julliard where the drama's reserved for the stage, and I think I belong back there.
So if you want the Upper East Side back, it's all yours.
You're the only "it" girl that matters, anyway.
You see to that yourself.
The Upper East Side is filled with high rollers.
Sorry, sir, but your debit card was declined.
Are you sure about that? Why don't you try running it again? I did.
Four times, to be precise.
Sorry about that.
Here you go.
I don't need change.
Some people choose to bet on themselves while others are happy to bet on someone else.
I'm sorry, but if you insist that Damien Hirst's work is anything but simple-minded, sensationalist, and fatuous, I'm not sure I'll be able to lay my head next to yours tonight.
That's--that's fine, but you can't deny that his influence on the art market as we know it today is massive.
But luck is a funny thing.
It's easy to accept it when it goes your way.
But when it doesn't call it injustice, call it treachery Hey, mom.
You were right.
The Upper East Side is toxic.
I never should have stepped foot in it, just like you warned me.
But, um, you don't have to worry because I'm done with it.
There's nothing else tying me to the Van Der Woodsens or their world, so I have to say, it's huge relief.
Talk to you soon.
But remember, the most important rule in gambling is that the house always wins.
You know you love me.

, Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here.
Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Don't you think it's time you head home? I am home.
No, I mean your other home, the one with your wife in it.
As for the rest of my estate, I leave to you, Ivy Dickens.
You are never gonna get away with this.
You don't have a case.
I didn't do anything wrong.
The court will decide that.
Our relationship isn't about choosing one world or another.
Our relationship is our world.
We're a team.
Serena's Gossip Girl.
I'm gonna prove it to you.
You saved Chuck's life, and you did that because I'm Chuck's mother.
You're actually her.
You're Gossip Girl.
Please, whatever you do, just don't tell anyone.
It's one thing to accuse Serena of being Gossip Girl.
But sending in that video about Chuck? I can't forgive that.
I've always hesitated going after Lola's father for child support.
Do you even know who he is? I'm looking right at him.
What if my dad doesn't even know I exist? What if all he'd want is to know me? I'm sure he does.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

, Gossip Girl.
In our modern age, there are so many ways for information to travel.
And yet, with all our tablets and smartphones, there are still some people who like to get their morning dish the old-fashioned way.
Even without the information highway, good news always seems to travel fast.
But bad news? Well, you know what they say You know, I must commend myself on my choice of wardrobe for you today.
You are striking just the right tone of literate and serious yet playful and accessible.
I'm just meeting a couple of Simon & Schuster publicists.
It's really not a big deal.
Not a big deal? What could be more important than strategizing ways to publicize yourself? I don't know.
Maybe the banking crisis or-- or what's going on in Syria or-- Dan, we know you're never gonna be trending on Twitter if you choose those topics to discuss.
Now just be humble, self-deprecating, with a tinge of intellectual superiority.
And always leave them wanting more.
Have a great day! Dorota! Run me a hot bath.
I want a long soak in the tub and catch up on my reading.
I have better idea.
How about you take quick shower, then supervise me as I clean out your closet? You need more space, and I-I-I need to work off baby weight bad.
Did you see the look on Ivy's face when mother's nurse accused her of "taking unfair advantage of the weak and elderly"? Well, thank God that woman came forward and said what actually happened.
I knew right then that the judge would invalidate the will.
Tell me, Lily.
How much exactly did you pay that nurse to lie for you? 'Cause I have done nothing but love and care for Cece.
It's not my mom's fault that the truth finally came out.
So why don't you leave us alone before we head into one of these offices and file a restraining order against you? Hey, mom.
Where was Rufus this morning? I was kinda surprised he wasn't here to support you.
Well, Rufus had an appointment, and I just told him not to cancel because as long as you were by my side, I'd be fine.
So what happens now? The money just reverts back to you? Well, now that the will has been revoked, the estate will be split And she's flying in tonight to sign the paperwork.
There'll be gloating, no doubt.
Well, believe me, it's a small price to pay to be done with this whole thing.
And thank God nobody knew how dirty it really got.
Here she comes! Lily! Lily! Is the family still fighting with each other over your mother's inheritance? How's it feel going from high-class to high-trash? Well, I assure you, this is all one big misunderstanding.
The entire Rhodes clan couldn't be happier.
Any truth to the rumors that you and your husband are no longer living together? No.
None at all.
Serena, shall we? Wait, just one more question.
I think you dialed the wrong number.
Obviously, you meant to call your son and not me.
I know the news of me being Chuck's mother must have come as rather a big surprise to you.
Ya think? But it doesn't have to ruin anything between us.
Except for the small fact that every time I look at you now, I see a Bass in my face.
You know I still have feelings for you.
And now that you've broken up with that girl Lola, I think you might still have feelings for me, too.
Am I wrong? I should really go.
I'm gonna be out of the office all day.
But Can we meet after work tonight and at least talk it through? I don't know.
I never really saw myself as a "sleep with your best friend's mother" kind of a guy.
Just think about it, okay? All right.
Is it true what the paparazzi said about you and Rufus? Are you really not living together? Well, we're taking a little hiatus to clear our heads, yes.
Why didn't you tell me? Well, because I didn't want to worry you.
Rufus is in Brooklyn.
He's fine.
And, you know, he'll come around like he always does.
My bigger concern is the public perception of this whole mess that Ivy caused.
'Cause let me tell you something, Serena, nothing ruins a family reputation faster than a money fight.
You should be focusing on fixing things with Rufus.
I know! We'll have a big family dinner here tonight, to celebrate our victory in court.
And I'll invite a reporter from the New York social diary to dispel all the rumors of family strife.
You think the way to handle this is by inviting the media into our home? I'll find a way to get Rufus here.
You bring Lola.
We're not exactly in a good place right now.
Well, get in one.
Once they see us all together, these vicious rumors will evaporate before they began.
Nathaniel, are my ears playing tricks on me or did I hear you on the phone with a young lady earlier? No, not exactly.
Um You mother called to talk to me.
Well, I'm not sure which one of us this is more awkward for.
Neither am I.
Between my history with Diana and now yours, it's just too weird to even be in business with her.
I would love to find some funding and possibly buy her out for good.
You interested? Unfortunately, I'm still trying to decide what kind of relationship I want with her.
Which means I'm not ready to put her out of business just yet.
What you're saying is, since I already screwed her I don't need to also.
Oh, by the way, I hope you don't mind.
I called Andrew in to figure out where Diana's getting her money.
She needed my grandfather last time.
Someone must be bankrolling her now.
And when you find out who it is? I'll try and convince the investor to bet on me alone.
Do what you have to do, but I am respectfully staying out of it.
Andrew.
Mr.
Bass.
I did some digging.
I found out that Diana is getting her funding from an Australian holding company.
Were you able to find a name? Andrew, I need you to find out everything you can about Diana Payne.
I'll tell you, Dorota, for the first time in a long time, I feel as if all is right in the universe.
Not the Dior! Wait.
Why did you throw these away? I haven't read "New York" magazine yet.
It's too much clutter.
It clutter your brain.
You sure you want to read, miss Blair? There are some bad things about friends in there.
Don't you know me at all? I love reading bad things about my friends.
It's the only thing that makes me feel better about myself.
Dan made the approval matrix? In the highbrow/brilliant box? "Dan Humphrey writing a new book-- one that isn't a cheap sequel to 'Inside.
'" That's brilliant? I mean, I'm surprised he made the magazine at all, but He's highbrow and I'm lowbrow "for being married for less time than Kim Kardashian"? I was so wrong, Dorota.
All is not right in the universe.
The universe is totally upended, and we must right it immediately.
And how we plan to do that? I must become as highbrow as Dan this instant.
Hello, sweetie.
Hey, dad.
I-I think I need your help.
For you, anything.
What's going on? Word got out about all of our family drama over grandma's inheritance, and now mom wants to have a big dinner tonight and--and invite the press to try to fix it.
I don't know.
I just don't think that's the right way to handle it.
This is just your mother's process.
She needs to make sure everything looks good on the outside before she takes care of the inside.
Well, is there any way you can make it? You've been such a calming presence during all this craziness.
And Carol is gonna be there, which usually only adds to the conflict.
I wish I could, sweetie, but there's no way I can get into town on such short notice.
But don't worry.
I promise you, everything is gonna be just fine.
Okay.
Well, thank you anyway.
I love you, dad.
Love you, too, angel.
Bye.
I've always been a daddy's girl, but sometimes the problem with fathers Sorry about that.
Now where were we? I think you were about to tell me how you found out that you're my dad.
Is that they can be real sons of bitches.
How am I supposed to be okay with this? My mom knowingly kept me from you all these years.
It may sound crazy, but I think in her own way, she was just trying to protect everyone.
Well, she still should've told me about it, and then it could've been up to you and me what kind of relationship we wanted to have.
I know in your mind you think we lost a lot of good years, but The truth is, I was a lousy dad to Serena and Eric.
I think I finally learned from my mistakes.
So instead of looking back and cursing your mother, how about we focus on what we can have moving forward? Now your mom told me not to tell anybody about us, but If you'd like everyone to know the truth, it's fine by me.
I think it would be best if we didn't tell the family just yet.
I won't say a word.
Okay.
Have you heard the good news? A judge invalidated my mother's will, so we can now finally put all this drama behind us.
Now where are the champagne flutes? Uh, Lil why are you here? Well, because we're having a celebratory dinner tonight at our place, just the family, and I want you to come.
I'm sorry you're upset with me, but I think it's time we put our petty fighting behind us and move on.
What do you say? I'd say that doesn't sound like a real apology.
Well, I'm not sure I'm the one who needs to apologize.
Oh, you think I am? For what? Taking Ivy's side, paying her way behind my back? She was basically homeless.
That's because the home she'd been living in was mine.
That's exactly right, Lil.
It was yours, not ours.
Do you see what we're doing here, all this fighting and finger pointing? I thought we were in this together, but you do whatever you feel like.
Well, I could say the same thing about you.
This isn't how a marriage is supposed to be.
Who's wrong? Who's right? It doesn't matter.
What matters is that we're in a partnership.
I couldn't agree more.
Then how about you give me a call when you're ready to be a partner again? Wow.
That must've been one quick jet you took to get you back to New York already.
Serena.
Hello.
Do you wanna explain why you lied to me or why you were hanging out with Lola? If you must know, I Bonded with my niece at Cece's wake.
She's been a bit lonely with all this stuff with her mother.
I'm just trying to be there for her.
But that still doesn't explain why you told me you weren't in town.
I'm sorry.
It's just, you invited me to a family dinner, and I heard rumors that Lily and Rufus are having problems.
As you know, my presence tends to be the opposite of helpful around the two of them.
I never should've lied to you.
I-I didn't know what else to say.
Well, if you wanna make it up to me, why don't you come to dinner tonight? Please? I'm not gonna take "no" for an answer, so just say "yes," dad.
For me? You convinced me.
Thank you.
You know, I'm--I'm gonna invite Lola, too.
I'll see you at mom's at 8:00, okay? Great.
Yeah, I appreciate that.
Thanks.
Were you able to reach Jack? No.
Apparently, he's taken a leave of absence from Bass Australia, and no one seems to know where he is.
Of course, they say that's rather normal for Jack.
Well, you have a visitor.
Want me to let her in? Yeah, sure.
Thanks, Amy.
Nate, hi.
Lola, hey.
I just recently gained insight into how painful it must've been for Chuck to find out that Diana was his mom.
And I'm just really sorry for the role I played in that.
Oh, yeah, well, thanks for that.
But why? What happened to you? My father finally came forward, and, um, I just spent the morning with him.
So I really needed someone to talk to.
Well, I'm glad you came to me.
Believe it or not, I went through the same thing with Chuck when he thought he found his mother a couple years ago.
Another woman besides Diana? Yeah, but it turned out none of it was true.
It was just all this big lie orchestrated by his, um Orchestrated by his Uncle Jack.
Hey, Lola, I'm--I'm really sorry, but I can talk more about this later.
I've just gotta deal with something right now.
Are you gonna be okay? Thanks.
Hey, Amy, would you give me Andrew Tyler? And if you can't reach him, see if you can find any information online about a woman named Elizabeth fisher.
So as I was cleaning out my closet this morning, I suddenly had a brilliant-- And highbrow.
Thank you, Dorota.
A brilliant and extremely highbrow idea.
Such a shame to have all these beautiful accessories that are hidden from the world the vast majority of the time.
So I decided to allow F.
I.
T.
To exhibit my shoe and handbag collection.
This is the purse I brought to prom, and, of course, that is the shoe that Louis brought back to me from Paris in the beginning of our storybook romance.
Which ended even more famously than it began, didn't it? Maybe if you were still a princess, I'd bite, but since you're no longer royalty She still royalty to me.
Down, Dorota.
It's okay.
Also, it's far too similar to an exhibit we already did with Daphne Guinness.
Perhaps another time.
Who was that guy? Some representative from F.
I.
T.
More like similar word, but spelled "s"-- It doesn't matter.
How was the meeting with your publicist? They just wanted to see me in person so they could tell me I'm one of the five people nominated for the New York Public Library's and there's a cocktail reception tonight where they're honoring the nominees.
I was wondering if, uh, if you would be my date.
Well, of course.
I can't wait to be there to honor you, my boyfriend, who's doing such highbrow, brilliant things.
In fact, I'm gonna buy a new dress since clearly nothing is worthwhile in my entire collection.
Okay, but it's a cocktail party.
You can keep it casual.
Despite what F.
I.
T.
Believes, I think I know how to dress myself for an evening out, thank you very much.
Hey! Have you seen Lola? I just saw on "Gossip Girl" that she was here.
Oh, you just missed her.
Oh.
I just left her a message inviting her to this family dinner tonight, but I really wanted to make up with her in person after our tiff last week.
Oh, I'm glad.
Lola could really use some friends right about now.
She's just going through some things, you know? Unrelated to you, but Really? Everything okay? She just met her father for the first time today.
She spent the morning with him.
I think the whole experience just kind of threw her for a loop, you know? She spent the morning with her father? Yeah.
Nate, no word from Andrew yet, but I think I found that phone number your were asking for.
Ah.
Thanks, Amy.
Listen, Serena, I really need to go deal with this.
Excuse me.
Lily may have wanted the perfect nuclear family, but this bomb is going to start a war.
How's this for tonight's speech? "I learned many things writing this book.
"Number one-- don't exploit your friends.
"Number two--if you are going to exploit your friends, uh, you--you should probably tell them about it first.
" I can do better than this.
You know, I'd be happy to accompany you to the event as your proud father, if you want me to.
Okay, what's going on, dad? You haven't wanted to spend this much time with me since I wrote a term paper on British punk rock and the subculture of scorn.
All right, you got me.
Lily invited me to this big family dinner tonight, and I'm not sure if I wanna go.
Well, do I need to remind you that Lily's still your wife? Don't tell me you're on her side.
No, I'm not on any side.
But you gave me some very good advice recently on the importance of equality in a relationship.
And if Lily is taking steps to make things better, how can you not at least try to do the same? That's all.
Oh, hi.
Mom, I know you wanna have this great family dinner here tonight, but you have to cancel.
Why? What happened? I just I just found out that Lola's not my cousin, but she's my sister.
Which means dad was having an affair with Carol while you were still married.
How did you hear this? Well, dad lied to me about being out of town, and then I saw him with Lola.
And--and then Nate just told me that Lola spent the morning with her father.
Well, there still could be some other explanation.
No, no, this is the explanation.
It explains everything-- Carol hiding Lola from us, hiring Ivy to be her.
You know in your heart that this is the truth.
Serena Your father and I divorced for many reasons.
His philandering was just one of them.
Nonetheless, we need to handle our present problems before we start digging into past ones.
Are either one of them aware that we know their secret? Okay, then let's keep it that way until after the reporter leaves and dinner is over.
And then I'll sit down with your father and Carol alone and calmly sort through this in a mature manner.
I want you to put this out of your mind, plaster on your best happy face, and go get ready for the party.
Will you do that for me? If that's what you want.
I'll see you in a few hours.
Hi.
This is Lily.
I know I'm probably the last person you wanna talk to right now, but I have a partnership proposition for you.
I'm sorry to leave all this on your answering machine, Elizabeth.
I just really need your help.
I mean, if you have any proof whatsoever that you are in fact Chuck's real mother, and if you care about him even a little bit, now would be the time to come forward.
Feel free to contact me anytime, day or night.
Thank you very much.
What'd you find out? That the first record of our "Diana Payne" was three years ago.
Before that, it's like she didn't even exist.
So if Diana Payne's not her real name, how do we ever find out her story? How do I look? Suspicious.
You heard Mr.
Humphrey.
Why you dressed so fancy for casual book party? Ah, guess the opera gloves may be a bit much.
I smell a scheme when I see one.
What's going on? It is very simple, Dorota.
After carefully studying back issues of "New York" magazine, I realized that I don't aspire to be anything like the highbrow/brilliant people at all.
They're all boring doctors curing diseases and lame philanthropists trying to save the world.
Who wants to be on that list? But Mr.
Dan's not lame.
Fine.
He is the exception to the rule.
But my point is-- highbrow/despicable.
That's where you find the headline makers having all the fun.
Gwyneth, Victoria Beckham, Mayor Bloomberg-- those are my people, Dorota, and it is time that I become one of them again.
Now I have written a list of talking points for when the press calls later this evening.
"Do say Blair is generous and impulsive.
Don't say any of this was premeditated.
" You going to steal Mr.
Dan's spotlight on big night, aren't you? That would be merely despicable.
But if I do it while performing an incredibly honorable and magnanimous deed, then it's highbrow/despicable.
So I was, uh, thinking about what we talked about earlier, and I decided that as your husband, I'd like to come and support you this evening.
Oh, that's very sweet of you Rufus, but unfortunately, dinner's been canceled.
I'll call you later.
All right, you got me here.
Now what kind of a "partnership proposition" did you have in mind? I can work with this.
You can work with what? Take my coat, will you? Uh you look beautiful, but I did tell you this was casual, right? This is casual.
Be right back.
Dorota, why isn't anything posted on "Gossip Girl" yet? I don't know.
I sent in tip about how your Elie Saab couture upstages stodgy lions ten minutes ago, just like you said.
Well, it isn't working.
No one's paying any attention to me.
Hey.
How you doing? I'm Dan Humphrey.
It looks like I'm going to shift into phase two earlier than I thought.
on modern class distinctions and the near ritualistic social mores of the Upper East Side.
It was almost Austenian in nature.
Or Waldorf-Ian Being as that I was his muse and inspiration.
And hi.
I'm Blair Waldorf.
Hi.
Blair Waldorf.
Hi.
Blair Waldorf.
Hi.
Mm.
Victor, I really appreciate you doing this for me.
The empire just isn't the same without you, man.
Well, I might be back there very soon if anyone finds out what I just did.
Well, I'll be super quick, I promise.
All right, Diana.
Reveal yourself.
Well, I really appreciate the invitation.
Yes, of course.
I think it's very important for you to see firsthand all this infighting over money has been just so wildly exaggerated by the press.
You can understand how to an outside eye-- Oh, nonsense.
The truth is, one bad egg threatened to tear the whole family apart.
But as you'll see this evening, I would never let that happen.
I'm, um, sorry that my husband won't be in attendance, but he's feeling a little under the weather.
Excuse me.
Are you all right? Because this isn't exactly the happy face that we talked about earlier.
I just still feel a little weird about tonight.
Is it too late to cancel? Darling, it is already happening.
Oh, Carol! Looking just as great as ever.
Hi.
Hi.
Uh, Carol, this is David Patrick Columbia of the New York social diary.
Hi! Nice to meet you.
If you wanted to see my underwear, all you had to do was ask.
Are you just gonna stand there, staring at me, or would you like to tell me why you've broken into my hotel room? If you must know, I was Looking for something for you to wear.
The truth is, I've just been Thinking about your call today.
I'm listening.
Our chemistry is clearly undeniable.
And I'm just tired of fighting it.
So I'm not going to anymore.
Good evening, Carol.
How are you? You can breathe easier now, William.
Since I've gotten half of my mother's estate, you're no longer in danger of losing everything anymore.
And our little secret? I see no reason to tell anyone else.
How about you? Hello, sweetheart.
You're looking lovely as ever.
Oh, thank you.
I get it from my mom.
Wow! Look who's here.
Can you believe it? All of us together in the same room, one big happy family.
Well, now that our final guest has arrived, if you'll follow me, I know we're in for quite a meal.
Next up to say a few words about his book and tell us what the young lions means to him-- Dan Humphrey.
Thank you, Deborah.
Your brilliant short stories inspire me to write better-- and get to the point quicker.
I believe it was Hemingway who once said-- What a wonderful introduction, Dan.
I truly could not tell you how moved I was by all the touching things you wrote about me in "Inside.
" A book can only be read by people who know how to read it.
Otherwise, it is nothing more than a paperweight or a doorstop.
Which is why I, Blair Waldorf, have decided to provide an endowment to the young lions fund to help with children's literacy, so that all the despicable new yorkers our there like me can one day grow up to read "Inside" themselves.
However, as always, I prefer to remain anonymous.
So a toast to Dan.
And to literacy.
And to me Anonymously.
Cheers? Well, in the spirit of the evening, I've decided to serve tonight's meal family style.
Mom, this is so unlike you.
You hate anything family style.
Yes, well, I've since realized how important sharing is to the family dynamic.
Us Van Der Woodsens share more than you could possibly imagine.
Yeah, like when you used to steal my leg warmers when we were teenagers.
Yes, just like that, or when you stole my husband and decided to have a baby with him behind my back.
Oh, my God.
Mom, why are you doing this now? Okay, I think David's seen enough family bonding for one evening.
No, please, Serena, let him stay.
I don't want there to be any more secrets.
Why did you tell Lily? I never said a word.
Lola was never supposed to know about this.
Well, maybe if you didn't want me to know, you shouldn't have tried to blackmail him.
And if it wasn't bad enough that you slept with my husband all those years ago and left your daughter in the dark about her father's identity, then you send an imposter into my home to get money.
You know what? I don't need to listen to this any longer.
I got what I came here for-- my half of the inheritance, and I'm leaving.
It's not exactly that easy.
Gentlemen? What's going on? You're being arrested for fraud.
Ivy is the one who committed fraud, not me.
Yes, well, you're the one that put her up to it, so that kinda makes you the mastermind behind the whole thing.
Well, unfortunately for you, Ivy would never admit that to anyone.
Otherwise, she would incriminate herself in the process.
Ivy? Actually, I've already given my statement, and in exchange for ratting you out, I got off scot-free.
Uh-oh, Carol.
Dinner's over, and it looks like Ivy just served you your last supper.
You realize this isn't just hurting my mom.
It's hurting me, too.
Your mother deserves to be punished.
She defrauded all of us, and we should have done this months ago.
You know, don't listen to her, Lola.
This has nothing to do with fraud.
This is all because I slept with her husband two decades ago.
But here's the thing, Lily.
I never would have been with William in the first place if he were happy with you.
One tip-- if you want things to go smoothly in the jail, put her in solitary.
You know, maybe my mom was right keeping me from you all these years, because the truth hasn't helped anybody.
Lola, wait.
Let me take you home.
You know I never meant for any of this to happen, right? Oh, wow, what's next? You gonna walk her down the aisle? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going? They haven't even handed out the certificates to the nominees yet.
Did you really feel the need to steal the spotlight from me tonight because I was above you on the--on the back page of some magazine? No, that's ridiculous.
Is it? 'Cause you said in your speech something about me being "brilliant and highbrow," and if it's about that, it's a bit of an overreaction, don't you think? I mean, you know none of that stuff means anything to me.
Well, it means something to me, and it isn't just about the magazine.
I don't wanna live in someone else's shadow anymore.
I did it the whole year I was with Louis, and then with Chuck before that.
I'm sick of being behind the scenes in a relationship.
You're not behind-the-scenes with me.
That's what I love about us.
We are equals in this.
Well, that's not how I feel, and it's clearly not how other people view me.
Maybe you are so focused on how everyone else perceives you, that you no longer know who you are.
And that's too bad, 'cause if you could only see what I see Mm.
Is it safe to assume that you're ready to, um, resume our relationship again? What do you say we go downstairs and grab a drink together and continue exploring our options? Mwah.
Okay.
Actually, Diana, I, um, just got a text from Chuck.
He's back home, and he's, um, wondering where I am.
So if I could just take a rain check on that drink, then I'll just see you at the office.
Wait a minute! Serena, give me a minute, please.
Hey, look I'm sorry for not being truthful with you today.
And for cheating on your mother all those years ago.
That's between you and mom, but you lied to me today to protect Lola.
You left me when I was 4 years old, and when I tracked you down You wouldn't even see me.
All I ever wanted my whole life was a father, and all you ever did was avoid me, and then now when you find out about Lola, you just rush to be by her side.
Well, you broke my mom's heart, and now you just broke mine.
Rufus.
Don't get up.
I'm not gonna be long.
Apparently, you did have a dinner tonight, or so I read from a newsfeed about you getting your sister arrested.
Carol hurt this family too badly to just get away with it.
You sound just like your mother.
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.
My mother would have done anything to preserve our family name.
No matter the consequences to the actual family members, right? I'll bet you even paid off the nurse to testify against Ivy.
You know, I-I thought we'd grown together, but if this is who you wanna be I don't wanna have anything to do with it.
Rufus, are you saying you'd like a divorce? 'Cause where exactly are you gonna find some other Upper East Side woman to take care of you the way I have? Spoken like a true Rhodes.
You just made my decision for us to spend some time apart that much easier.
So thank you.
Oh, hey.
How was your day? I've decided to delete certain disturbing images of my mother's past from my mind And attempt a relationship with her.
Well, before you two start bonding and having spa weekends together, maybe you should see this.
Elizabeth fisher e-mailed me that picture a few minutes ago.
Take a look at the date in the corner.
It's right before you were born.
But Diana said Elizabeth couldn't get pregnant.
Well, I guess she lied to you.
Jack probably put her up to it.
Jack? What does he have to do with this? Turns out he's the one funding Diana.
He could have paid her to tell you whatever you wanted to hear.
And had her pretend Elizabeth's donated blood was really hers.
But if Elizabeth really is my mother, then why would she deny being the donor? Something still doesn't add up.
You were right.
The problem wasn't your success.
It was me.
Somehow between being traded for a hotel and selling out for a tiara, I lost my true self.
But I wanna be found.
Could you possibly help? I have a feeling that the real Blair Waldorf is a lot closer than you think.
Wasn't all that long ago that she and I were working side-by-side at "W," and I totally fell for her.
And what was that girl like? That girl is, uh, fiercely strong, independent, outspoken, beautiful, capable of anything, and no man or magazine should be able to take that away from her.
She sounds great.
I look forward to meeting her again.
I can't believe Lily did this to me.
Neither can I, but you have to stop thinking about your sister and start doing what's best for our daughter.
With you under arrest, it's going to be very difficult for you to access your money.
If you sign over power of attorney to me, I give you my word that I'll take care of Lola, and I will get you the best damn lawyers your mother's inheritance can buy.
You really care about her, don't you? I just wanna do the right thing.
You did the right thing.
Carol never should have put you in this position.
I want you to know I'm not like her.
I might have come to New York because Carol paid me to, but once I met you, the only thing that mattered to me was feeling like I was a part of your family.
So you've said, but there is, um, nothing to be done about that, is there? I could tear up this check.
Lily, please.
Just let me earn back a place in your heart.
Good-bye, Ivy.
Hello? I did what you asked.
I'll sign Carol's half of the estate over to you when I get to the apartment.
Thank you.
We both know she does not deserve that money, and your getting it away from her is the least you could do after what I found out about you two today.
But you are going to take care of Lola, right? That was our deal.
What kind of a monster do you think I am? You think just because she's a product of your extramarital affair that I would punish Lola.
I wouldn't do that.
Why don't I believe you? See you soon.
On second thought Take me to J.
F.
K.
What do you want? I know we've had our ups and downs.
Well, mostly downs.
But we're sisters now.
Half.
What's your point? I don't know a ton about being a sibling, but I have a hunch that uniting against parents is a pretty major bonding experience.
I was thinking the best way for you to get back at your mom is by helping me get my mom out of jail.
You never really stood a chance of exposing me as Gossip Girl, and I'm not really interested in being your sister all of a sudden.
So please just stay away from me and my family, okay, sis? I'll show you out now.
You okay? The only thing that Diana and Elizabeth have in common is my Uncle Jack.
Take a look at this photo again.
You see the tattoo on the guy's arm? Yeah.
So? So I know that tattoo.
Check it out.
The man in that photo is not my dad.
It's Jack.
What if all this subterfuge over my mother's identity was actually disguising the real question? It's not who's my mom.
It's who's my dad.
Nate, I think Jack Bass is my father.
Gossip Girl here-- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I want to help you stay on as Gossip Girl.
I want to protect your identity and help you keep the site.
You're actually her.
You're Gossip Girl.
Please, whatever you do, just don't tell anyone.
You saved Chuck's life, and you did that because I'm Chuck's mother.
What'd you find out? That the first record of our Diana Payne was three years ago.
Before that, it's like she didn't even exist.
So if Diana Payne's not her real name, how do we ever find out her story? If you wanted to see my underwear, all you had to do was ask.
I told Chuck he doesn't have my heart anymore.
I realized it belongs to someone else.
Elizabeth Fisher e-mailed me that picture a few minutes ago.
Take a look at the date in the corner.
It's right before you were born.
Take a look at this photo again.
You see the tattoo on the guy's arm? Check it out.
It's not who's my mom.
It's who's my dad.
Nate, I think Jack Bass is my father.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
They say in life there are two sides to every story.
But on the Upper East, we always have three.
There's his, hers But the most important is always mine.
Come in.
Oh, Dorota.
You didn't have to bring me breakfast.
Miss Serena, you must taste test my new Kreplach.
These bad boys take Warsaw faster than Red Army.
Oh, thank you, but do you mind just setting it down over there for a minute? I have to finish what I'm typing.
Miss Serena, all you do all day is type, type, type.
You take laptop with you everywhere.
It not healthy.
Well, after last week's family meltdown, this laptop is the only thing keeping me sane.
Writing is my new outlet.
You should be happy for me.
If you say so.
But Vanya say same thing about "Warcraft," and then D.
S.
L.
bill come Yes, of course everything's set for tonight.
There is nothing to worry about.
I hope that's not overconfidence I hear in your voice.
I don't need to remind you how sensitive an operation this is.
If anyone finds out Jack, they won't.
Chuck and everybody else thinks I'm his bloody mother.
They're off the scent completely.
What time are your guests arriving? Um, 9:00, I believe.
You know what? Let me just double-check that.
And our cargo? Hang on.
You know, give me a second? I'm gonna have to ring you back.
Hey, I was just thinking about you.
Were you? What a coincidence.
Yeah, I had fun the other night.
I'm just sorry we didn't get to have that drink after.
After you rifled through my things and stole my day planner? Your what? Come off it, Nate.
Where is my book? Diana, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Maybe you left it at work.
Maybe your assistant has it, but I don't.
You know what, Nate? I nearly believe you.
But if I can't find it, I'm coming to see you next.
Was that Diana? Yeah, looking for her book.
I played it clueless.
Good, because if she's going to continue to lie to us and pretend to be my real mother, I see no reason why we shouldn't return the favor.
Well, I think I bought us another day or two, but not much more.
Any progress cracking the code? None whatsoever.
It's all a jumble of numbers and letters.
Do you even know what you're looking for? Some link to Jack.
His secretary still hasn't heard from him? Not in over a month.
She thinks he found love in Phuket.
I'm sure he's here.
And if he's my father like I think he is, the only way to get the truth is to find him.
Yeah, well, unless you wanna watch "A Beautiful Mind" again, I think we're gonna need to hire a professional-- you know, someone from the military or even a serial killer.
It takes a special level of crazy to go that far to hide your secrets.
I'll be back in a bit.
Any luck? Nope.
Serena must've changed Gossip Girl's username and password after Georgina sent her the laptop.
Well, I'm just glad you finally believe me about Serena acting as Gossip Girl.
And I apologize again for ever having doubted you.
And for calling me a fame-whoring social climber? Yeah, that, too.
You hungry? Care to discuss passwords over pancakes? Mm.
How often do you shave? What? I'm just asking.
Come on, let me help.
I'm very good.
Everyone said my Adolfo stole Constance/St.
Jude's "Sweeney Todd" in sixth grade.
Uh, I'm already late to meet Alessandra in Brooklyn.
She's dying to come over to the loft 'cause I know she wants to read my first chapter.
It's not done? It's basically done.
What is Dan Humphrey's definition of "basically"? Page 2.
I'm blocked, all right? It happens.
All I need is a fiery bolt of inspiration.
That makes two of us.
You know, after my theatrics at the Young Lions Club, it's time to quit my moping and get back in touch with what it truly means to be the Blair Waldorf.
That's right.
O.
G.
B.
-- Original Gangsta Blair.
Exactly.
I need to find that Blair again, and what better place to look for her than at the met, surrounded by some of my favorite paintings? Well, you better not meet any princes this time.
You don't need to worry.
Believe me, I'm done with fairy tales.
It's time to be real again.
Lunch later? We can compare notes on soul searching.
Done.
We're very lucky, you know? Most couples don't give each other the freedom we do.
But you and I, we can spend our days as we please.
And you know why? You trust me.
I trust you.
I think I just quoted Ray J.
I don't know who that is, but sure.
Mmm.
Now be gone.
So what's the plan? I mean, we can't let Serena stay Gossip Girl.
Ah, trust me, I know.
It's not good for anybody, especially Serena.
We just need to figure out how to get her to see that herself.
Or we could out her to Perez right now.
Lola, I know you're angry, but Serena's your sister.
Well, technically half.
It's time to take her down.
I bet the real Gossip Girl would help us.
Yeah, well, she's no picnic either.
I mean, I agree we have to deal with the Serena problem.
I'm just not sure now is the best time to do it.
You know, Chuck's searching for the truth about his real father, and I'm trying to dig up some dirt on his fake mother Diana so I can force her out of "The Spectator.
" Well, Serena and Diana are allies, so maybe two birds, one stone.
Yeah, well, I guess I could ask the real Gossip Girl to help me with Serena.
I do still have her number she texted me from.
Okay, and I can pay a little visit to Serena and get her to help you out with Diana.
Oh.
There you are.
Rufus let me in.
I hope you don't mind.
So where's the manuscript? I'll admit, I might have peeked in your office.
Well, you know what? It's still coming along, but, um Dan.
I know, you're blocked.
That's why I wanted to talk.
Look, when artists fall in love, their work invariably suffers.
You just need to refocus yourself creatively.
Y-yeah, yeah, that's exactly what I was telling Blair this morning.
Well, luckily for you, I already have the perfect solution.
That's great.
What is it? I don't want to ruin the surprise.
Just meet my friend Lucia for lunch at the Atlantic Grill.
Let fate take care of the rest.
No, I can't do lunch.
I already made plans with Blair.
You'll wanna cancel them for this.
I promise.
Okay.
Chuck.
I don't have time for any of your nonsense.
I have a very busy day planned.
Blair, listen to me, please.
I have this book.
It's written in code, and I desperately need to crack it.
I remembered how good you are at things like this.
Or at least you were.
Maybe that was the old you.
You know what, Bass? Today is your lucky day.
What are you doing here? I thought I made myself clear.
You know, Serena, I don't know why you hate me so much when all I've ever done is protect you and your secret.
But if that's the way you're gonna treat me, then forget it.
Wait.
If it's important, I-I do wanna hear.
You can't trust Diana.
I just found out that she's working with the real Gossip Girl to take you down.
I don't know why she'd do something like that, but I do.
Diana told me herself that she and Gossip Girl have a history, so Gossip Girl is probably using one of the secrets of Diana's past to blackmail her again.
Well, what are you gonna do about it? Well, if those two are working together, there's nothing I can do.
You're gonna think this is crazy, but What if you could find out Diana's secret first? How? Well, Nate stole Diana's day planner, and, uh, it's all in code so no one knows what it says.
But why go to that much trouble? It seems to me if you break the code, you have Diana's secret.
You know, I-I did see Diana writing in her planner once, and there was a little book next to it.
Maybe that other book is the key to the code.
Oh, my God.
Can you get it? Well, if I do, will--will you help me figure out her secret? Yes, absolutely.
Okay, I'll head over to Diana's office, and I'll let you know what I find.
Be careful, Lola.
When you double-cross a double agent, there's always double trouble.
No, it's not on Diana's desk or in her filing drawer.
Ooh.
A Big Ben paperweight.
Well, keep looking.
The key to the code has to be somewhere at "The Spectator.
" Nate said he didn't see it at her hotel.
I'm doing my best.
I'll call you soon as I leave here, okay? Bye.
Bravo, Serena.
You're a better actor than you know.
And to invent a decoder book? Sheer genius.
Oh, I have my moments.
I wouldn't worry too much about Nate, though.
Your book is clearly useless to him without the key.
All the same, I won't feel completely reassured until I get it back.
Would you mind fetching it for me? Don't you mean stealing it back from my friends? That's going out on quite a limb.
What's in it for me? Only Gossip Girl's cell phone number.
How do you have that? I have friends in high places.
Think about it, Serena.
If you can use this number to track down the real Gossip Girl, I bet you can blackmail her into letting you keep the site.
She'll quit before she'll ever risk being exposed, and you can stay Gossip Girl forever.
But how do I know that's the real number? You don't, but you'll find out when you get me my book back.
Apologies.
I just needed a few minutes to get into character.
If you wanna think like Diana Payne, you have to become Diana Payne.
Cheers.
Thanks a lot.
You're adorable.
"Spectator.
" Regardless of whether we find Jack, I can't tell you how glad I am at this moment that Diana isn't really my mother.
Hand me the book.
Well It's not classic Caesar.
I can tell that just from looking at it.
What is that? This is my cipher slide.
Don't you have one? There was a brief period in the third grade where I suspected my mother was reading my diary, and measures had to be taken.
But this is a Vigenre code.
It's not unbreakable, but it can take a long time, especially without software.
We don't have a long time.
Maybe she used something simpler for dates and times.
Let me look at the calendar.
Look.
There.
What? On the first Saturday of every month at 9:00 P.
M.
, there's an appointment made up of And they're each different, but You crack those, you can get the rest.
And look-- this month's appointment is tonight.
Nate was dating Diana during some of those Saturdays.
Well, maybe we can jog his weed-addled mind into remembering something.
It's worth a shot.
Let's go.
Hi.
Uh, Lucia? Ah, you must be Dan.
Ciao.
It is such a thrill to meet you, eh? I am a huge "Inside" fan.
I ordered a giant box of copies for our office in Rome.
Oh, that was you? Yes.
Please sit.
So you are adorable, eh? Thank you.
So since Alessandra promised not to spoil the surprise, I would like to tell you why I've asked you here today.
I would like to cordially invite you to join this summer's group of artists in residence at the Italian Arts and Letters Institute in Rome.
Um I'm--I'm sorry.
Is it the Arts and Letters Institute, like where--where Roth and--and Mailer went? Mm-hmm, and don't forget Sontag, DeLillo, Ondaatje.
I, uh uh Wow.
I don't know what to say.
I'm--I'm--I'm honored.
I can't tell you how much I need this right now.
Well, perfecto.
Then it's settled.
You'll spend the entire summer at the villa, eating, drinking, living, and creating.
The retreat is--is all summer? Yes, of course.
Is there a problem? No.
Well, I don't-- I don't think so.
I need to talk to my girlfriend about this, 'cause we haven't discussed our summer plans yet, um, and we probably should decide them together, so-- Well, I leave for Rome first thing tomorrow, so I will need your answer by tonight.
You do realize that there are a lot of young writers who would jump at this opportunity, Daniel.
Of course.
Okay.
So Mangiamo.
Mm.
Okay, this is the first time Andrew Tyler found any record of a "Diana Payne" in L.
A.
Oh, the deed to her house, which she bought from "Simon Callow".
Mm.
Hey, sorry to barge in.
I just felt so bad that I struck out.
Oh, don't worry about it.
It's not your fault.
Yeah.
We're not really having any luck here, either.
Well, I was thinking, maybe since I'm the one that saw Diana transcribing, if I see the day planner again, that may jog my memory.
Too bad Chuck has it.
Looks like we might have a lead, thanks to Blair's powers of observation.
But unfortunately, the entire clue trail hangs by the flimsiest of threads-- Nate's long-term memory.
If you'll excuse me Hello? Did you find your inspiration? Yes.
Uh, but the only problem is, it's in Rome.
Blair, I just got invited to the Institute of Arts and Letters' summer artists retreat.
Oh, my gosh.
That's incredible! But what could possibly be the problem, besides Rome in August? Well, for starters, I would be gone all summer.
So, you know, being a I thought we should discuss it first.
That's sweet, but I would never stand in the way of an opportunity like that.
You have to take it.
Wait.
Are you on your phone at the museum? Oh.
No, actually, I'm at the Empire.
Waldorf, we need you.
Just a sec! Oh, is that Chuck? Yes.
He asked for my help with a scheme.
You don't mind, do you? Scheming is classic Blair, and I'm getting my groove back just like I wanted.
No, of course.
It's just I-- you know, I-I-mean, uh Uh, with Chuck? And Serena and Nate and Serena light.
Don't worry.
I'm not worried.
Why would I be worried? So--so are you--are you sure I should say "Yes"? Remember what we said this morning? We're good with each other.
We help each other grow, we don't hold each other back.
I'll see you later.
Yeah, great.
Nathaniel, you must remember something Diana was doing that was unusual on those Saturdays.
Besides you, of course.
Guys, I'm looking! Gym.
Gym.
Bangs trimmed.
Gym.
Oh, ha ha ha.
Look, Diana and I barely spent any time outside of the office.
We just never went on any real dates.
And we just were working and you know-- O-okay.
I think that's my excuse to leave.
I promise I'll keep searching till I find the little black key to Diana's book.
Nate, we have tried this the easy way.
Oh, my God.
The book is gone.
Serena! Let's make sure I've got this straight.
Blair wants you to go to Rome? She couldn't have been happier for me.
And that's a bad thing why? Of course I want her to be happy for me, just not that happy.
I mean, you know, she d--she didn't have to think about it for a second.
Dan.
You didn't hear her--or Chuck.
It was--it was like she wanted me to leave so she could just spend all summer with him.
I'm sure that's not the case.
She loves you.
Mm I wouldn't go that far.
You two haven't I mean, we're not in high school anymore.
It takes--it takes time, you know.
To feel or to admit? That's not--that's not the point.
This morning, it felt like we were-- we were in such a good place.
And I'm sure you will be again the moment you sit down and actually talk to her.
And you're right.
You're right.
I just need to talk to her in person.
Are you sure that right now is the best time? I mean, when she's in the middle of S.
, I can't believe you'd go behind our backs like this.
And why are you protecting Diana? Diana told me if I got her book back, then she would give me Gossip Girl's real phone number.
I finally have a chance to see who she really is.
And that's more important to me than helping Nate kick Diana out of "The Spectator.
" More important than me finding my father? What? Diana lied to me.
She's not my mother.
And I think she's covering for my father-- well, my real father Jack.
Oh, Chuck, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.
This book is the only chance I have of tracking Jack down.
Well, what can I do? Be with us, not against us.
You have me, 100%.
Great.
Let's get rid of this bitch once and for all.
She's late.
We should call.
Well, maybe Diana just missed her appointment.
Or Lola couldn't bribe the girl she knows at the spa.
You guys should just trust me and stop dithering.
I sent in a seasoned professional.
She's in.
I can't tell you how much my shoulders need this.
Treatment about to begin.
Just Relax.
First, I do exfoliation with Japanese sea salt body scrub.
Excellent choice.
Then wild mint foot rub.
I still don't know how you're gonna massage the code out of her.
Watch and learn, Archibald.
Mmm! It's been so long since my last massage.
I know.
Why you miss last appointment? What? I didn't.
My boss want to charge you.
Spa have very strict cancellation policy.
But I didn't book a session.
Unless my assistant did.
What day was it? First Saturday last month.
I wasn't even in the country that weekend.
Not that it's any business of yours, but I was actually in Europe.
England? Italy? France? Portugal! What do we know about Portugal? They speak Portuguese? They play pretty good football.
They don't.
Hey, who was that tutor you had in, like, the sixth grade? Mariana Costa.
She was from Lisbon.
I spent our lessons trying to get under her Saia.
Needless to say, I succeeded.
What if all these letters are just different international phone numbers? The code for that night was "K-L-L.
" Which is "5-5-5" on the keypad, and we all know from watching movies that's fake.
And you run a newspaper? If she had been using a numeric key, it could be decoded as "0-0-1," then "3-5-1.
" That's the country code for Portugal.
Some childhood memories never fade.
B.
, did you just do it? Got it.
Thanks, Dorota.
Now we do complimentary body wrap.
I didn't order one.
You need.
Trust.
I go get seaweed.
Okay, now if I'm right-- and we all know I am-- then this is tonight's number.
Yeah, but who does it call? There's only one way to find out.
How can I help you? Yes, I'm interested in the event tonight.
Yes, how many? Three.
Three it is.
Will I need to send a car? No, the address will be fine.
The Vardin house in Briarcliff Manor.
See you at 9:00.
Does anybody have any idea what we're about to get ourselves into? Not a clue, but hopefully, Jack will be there.
Yeah, and maybe someone that can tell us who Diana Payne really is.
I'm gonna get Thur to pull the car around.
What's going on? Wait.
What about Diana's book? This is my only chance to find out who Gossip Girl really is.
I already made a copy.
Well, I don't know why you're suddenly so interested in that sad little shut-in, but here you go.
We don't need it anymore.
Thank you.
Hey, follow that limo.
Thank you.
Oh! Serena, you are a lifesaver! How did you do it? I just asked.
Well, I'm indebted to you.
Oh, wait.
No, I'm not, because I've got something you want-- Gossip Girl's real phone number.
Use it wisely.
Thank you.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
Bye.
Here.
Let me.
What do you think you're doing? GPS'ing Gossip Girl.
How else are we gonna find her? What do you mean "we"? Look, I'm the only person who knows why you really want Gossip Girl's phone number.
Even if you think you can figure out who she is, you can find a way to keep her site forever.
And why would you help me? Well, you ever heard the expression "the devil you know"? Oh, look.
Gossip Girl's on the move.
And, uh, my van is just around the corner.
Okay, fine, let's go.
Who doesn't love a road trip? Just watch your blind spot, kiddies, or you'll wind up blindsided.
Excuse me.
Whoa.
This is not what I was expecting at all.
Nate, this is a s*x club? It's more of a roving brothel.
My father--well, Bart-- belonged.
Ah, that's how you knew the lockbox code.
Jack's here.
We just have to find him.
How can you be sure? It's the perfect place for a degenerate like him to hide in.
It's also the kind of event he wouldn't miss for the world.
Wouldn't blame him.
But what on earth does this have to do with Diana? Find out and you'll have her out of "The Spectator" by sunrise.
Hi.
I'm Josephine.
You look like you need a friend.
He has a friend.
Then why don't I show you the bedrooms? Both of you? Yeah, let's-- let's look around.
Hey, what are you guys doing here? And why are you dressed as waitresses? Uh, the bouncer at the door asked if we were "India's girls.
" So we just went with it, and then he pointed us to the dressing room and told us to change.
But full disclosure--we actually GPS'ed Gossip Girl's phone, and it led us here.
Wait.
India's girls? Who's--who's India? I don't know.
The madame? But I bet if we find India, we find out how Diana fits into all of this.
Or we just find Gossip Girl and make her tell us Diana's secret.
Maybe this place is how they know each other.
Wait, wait, wait, there she is.
All right, let's split up.
We'll look for India.
Serena, you go find Gossip Girl.
And stay away from Diana if you can.
If she even knows that we're here Ugh.
This isn't my first rodeo.
Thank you.
No, but it's mine, and it's awesome.
I'm sorry.
I thought you'd love that last room, especially the canopy bed.
You look like the type that likes a royal theme.
Not anymore.
Perhaps we should extend our search to beyond just bedrooms.
Uh, yes.
Any dark, small space will do.
Closet, attic, the wine cellar.
We might not have time to see the whole house.
The whole house? We'd love to.
Every room, even the occupied ones.
She likes to watch.
Meter's running, kid.
You getting out or we heading back? Just--just, uh, just give me a minute, all right? Yeah.
Hey.
Just checking in.
You and Blair talk yet? No.
No, but we're about to.
Dan, it's been hours.
Where are you? Honestly, I don't-- I don't really know.
But, uh, I went to go talk to her at the Empire, and then I saw her and Chuck leaving together in his limo.
So, um I may have followed them.
May have? Yeah, listen, something's going on, dad.
I mean, she--she's--she's with Chuck inside a huge mansion.
I'm worried about her.
Dan, the only person I'm worried about right now is you.
So whatever Blair is doing with or without Chuck, you have to trust her.
If you storm in there and confront her, she'll know for sure you don't.
Let Blair have her evening, and wait for her to tell you about it.
I'm sure she will if you give her a chance.
Hey, man, I think one of your girls slipped something in my drink.
Relax, kid, it's a party.
Things happen.
Well, I wanna talk to India.
Where is she? Upstairs, not seeing visitors.
I understand, but I told you not to worry about Nate and Lola.
I can handle them.
The important thing is that everything else run smoothly.
I'm gonna call you back.
Get me head of security.
Well, the dumbwaiter has potential, but it might be too cramped.
One of us would have to stand.
B.
What are you doing here? Looking for Gossip Girl.
It's a long story.
Wait, did you find Jack? Not yet.
Okay, well, be careful because Diana's downstairs, so if she sees you and Chuck I'll deal with Diana.
And good luck.
You two go on without me.
I'll make sure Diana doesn't find out you're here.
Out.
Everyone out.
What? Wait.
Someone tipped the cops off.
They're on their way.
No.
No.
Let's go! Party's over! Police are on their way.
Time to go.
Hello, Chuck.
Hello, India.
Oh, my God.
No.
No, it can't be.
Chuck, I'd love to chat, but I'm late for something very important.
You're not going anywhere until I get some answers.
Unfortunately, it's fairly time-sensitive, so if you could please get out of the way Diana Payne isn't my mother.
Sure she is.
Admit it.
You're the one who's been behind the lies all these years.
Why do you have to be so melodramatic about everything? Tell, the truth, Jack, for once in your life.
It's time.
That's your arm around Elizabeth.
That photo's 20 years old.
And it could be anyone.
It's your tattoo.
Don't try and tell me otherwise.
You were sleeping with Elizabeth, weren't you? I've slept with so many Elizabeths over the years.
I mean, she could be one.
Are you my father? Answer me.
You sure you really want to know? You! Let's go.
Just a minute.
I said, let's go.
Get him outta here.
What just happened? Did you tell him? Tell him what? What you're really hiding here.
Give us a moment.
Listen, Nate, whatever you and your sidekick may think you know-- Oh, give it up, Diana.
India.
Whatever your name is.
It's over.
And unless you want the whole world to know you run a high-class prostitution ring, you're gonna walk away from "The Spectator" forever.
You've disappeared before.
It's time to do it again.
Ooh, I'm really scared, especially as you don't have a shred of proof that I run this joint.
Who says I'm not just another customer, like you? Would you care to look at a video of you checking out the girls? I'm sure "The New York Times" would.
I could spitzer you so fast your head would spin.
I think I'll take my chances with the cops when they get here.
What cops? You don't really think they're coming here, do you? I was the on who ordered everyone out.
Fine.
We'll just have to get Gossip Girl to do it.
Hey, I got your text.
What is this place? I have no idea.
I've never been here before in my life.
It's Diana's office, and this is her club, and we need Gossip Girl to break the story.
I already knew.
Don't worry.
But I promise I won't tell a soul if you help me out right now, please.
I don't have my laptop.
It's in my bag, which is in the dressing room.
But I can try to send a blast from my phone.
Hmm, that's That's weird.
It says I'm locked out.
Mm.
Let me try signing in again.
Well, while you wait, I think I'll just go off and attend to business.
She seems to be having technical difficulties.
I don't know what's wrong, but I can get my computer right now.
Whatever you saw, or you think you saw, you can't tell Chuck.
Of course I'm going to tell him.
He has a right to know.
And there's nothing you can do that will make me change my mind.
This isn't about me.
Do you realize how many people will get hurt if this gets out? You need to go.
You've already complicated things enough by being here.
This whole thing was supposed to go off without a hitch.
You better hope it still does.
My computer's gone.
Gossip Girl.
She took it.
What? How do you know that? Because we set you up.
After we got the address for tonight, I gave it to Gossip Girl.
And I made sure you followed her cell phone all the way here.
You changed the password on her site, so she needed the actual laptop.
I'm just sorry for Nate that she grabbed it before you could send that post about Diana.
How could you do this to me? Do what to you, Serena? Stop you from anonymously attacking innocent people like me and your friends? No, but that's not true.
The old Gossip Girl hurt people, but I'm different.
No, you're not, Serena.
Just look at what's happened to you.
You've cut yourself off from everything and everyone that you care about.
It's not right.
Neither is tricking me.
Yeah, well, go ahead and blame me, but I did this to help you, not to hurt you.
Either way, it's over.
The real Gossip Girl's back.
For now, but I have her number.
The number you have reached is disconnected.
Nate's not answering.
Probably already left with Lola.
Have you seen Serena? No, I haven't.
What's wrong? Nothing.
I'm sorry.
You look like you just found out Jack Bass is your father.
Chuck, can we just go, please? After everything we've been through, there's no room for secrets, nor should there be.
Whatever it is, you can tell me, Blair.
It's just us here, you and me.
I think once everyone is gone and it's quiet you need to go back into that house.
Have Arthur take you back to the city.
Pronto.
Lucia? Hi, it's Dan Humphrey.
Ah, Dan.
Great to hear from you.
Have you decided? I have.
My girlfriend wants me to go Ah, fantastic! I knew a writer such as yourself could not pass on an opportunity like this.
But, um, I'm saying no.
What? Why? Well, I can work anywhere, but I don't think my relationship can.
And--and right now both of those things are very important to me.
I'm sorry.
Well, I cannot tell you how sorry I am that you won't be joining.
Maybe next year.
Ciao, Daniel.
Shouldn't the boat be here by now? I'm sure they just got delayed.
They'll be here soon.
By the way, the fake raid was a great diversion.
Once I saw Chuck was here, I knew I had to get him out as quickly as possible.
Well, it worked.
Yeah.
When we're done here tonight, we need to discuss a renegotiation of my fee.
It just doubled.
Mm.
That's a lot of cash.
Silence is expensive.
You know that.
Hmm.
Once the boat gets here and safely departs, you'll be taken care of.
Don't worry.
Is "Gossip Girl" back up yet? Not yet.
But as soon as she is, I'm going to need her help to tell the world that Diana is our generation's Heidi Fleiss.
Oh, well, I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.
Serena said Gossip Girl's always known the truth about Diana.
So if she's never run it, it's probably 'cause she'd rather lord it over here.
Oh, that's great.
So now the only way to get Diana out of "The Spectator" is to run the story on the front page of my own newspaper? Wait.
Why not do that? You're joking, right? No, I'm not.
I mean At least I think I'm not.
What's the downside? You have to at least think about it.
Okay.
As long as you stay here and think about it with me.
Miss Serena.
You scare me half to death.
Oh.
Sorry.
Why you eat berries in dark? I don't know.
I guess I just forgot to eat dinner tonight.
Where is your computer? I-I go get it.
No, that laptop belonged to someone else, and she took it back, so Then we go to best buy, get a new one.
You feel better, in control again.
I don't think that's possible anymore.
Gossip Girl here-- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Spotted--Blair Waldorf headed back to Brooklyn.
Haven't we paid the toll enough for that relationship? I was just, uh, just about given up on you.
How was your day of scheming? You're upset with me, aren't you? No, of course not.
I'm not upset with you.
I'm upset with the woman from the institute.
She, uh, apparently found somebody that they wanted more.
Oh, no.
How is that possible? I don't know, but it means you're stuck with me all summer.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm not that sorry.
I'm starving.
Why don't we go grab a bite at Kellogg's? And I'll tell you all about my night and the crazy brothel we ended up at.
A brothel? You ended up at a brothel? I'll tell you all about it over dinner.
Hey.
I love you.
You know that, right? I do now.
Come on.
Let's go.
Of course, everybody knows that on the Upper East Side, nothing lasts forever.
And when one door closes The only question is, who's waiting behind it? Dad.
Oh, my God.
Gossip Girl here Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I would like to cordially invite you to join this summer's group of artists at the Italian Arts and Letters Institute in Rome.
I would never stand in the way of an opportunity like that.
You have to take it.
You didn't hear her.
Or Chuck.
It was--it was like she wanted me to leave so she could just spend all summer with him.
I'm saying no.
Why? I can work anywhere.
I don't think my relationship can.
It's over.
And unless you want the whole world to know you run a high-class prostitute ring, you're gonna walk away from "The Spectator" forever.
My computer's gone.
Gossip Girl.
She took it.
How do you know that? 'Cause we set you up.
The old Gossip Girl hurt people, but I'm different.
No, you're not, Serena.
Either way, it's over.
The real Gossip Girl is back.
Whatever you saw or you think you saw, you can't tell Chuck.
He has a right to know.
Do you realize how many people will get hurt if this gets out? Whatever it is, you can tell me, Blair.
You need to go back into that house.
Dad.
Oh, my God.
So the car accident was real.
I was lucky to survive it.
But it wasn't an accident.
I'd been threatened.
By who? Very powerful competitor of mine.
I had information on some transactions of his that could've put him away for a very long time.
When his threats didn't work You had someone ram your limo with a truck? Dad, you could've gone to the police.
You didn't have to-- Yes, I did.
He'd made it quite clear that both you and Lily were fair game.
Once I realized his threats weren't empty, the only way out was to make him believe he'd already won.
Once I got to the hospital that night, I thought that would be my best chance.
So, what, you just paid some doctor to switch off the machines, and hope Lily was crying so much, she wouldn't notice you were actually still breathing? What did we bury in that coffin? Charles I am here with you now, trying to explain.
Humphrey residence.
Blair Waldorf speaking.
Oh, hi, Alessandra.
No, he's in the shower.
Can I take a message? Mm-hmm.
Got it.
Yeah, no, don't worry.
I will tell him the second I see him.
That was your agent.
She wants you to reconsider the program in Rome, which is odd because you told me they went with someone else.
Uh, well, yesterday, when you ended up with Chuck, I was a little nervous about leaving for the whole summer.
And I know you told me there's other people there, it's not romantic, but Come on.
It's Chuck.
So you lied to me? Uh, I-I figured you would think I was just some jealous freak if I told the truth.
Well, maybe because you are.
But you don't have to be.
You have nothing to worry about.
Take the offer.
It's an amazing opportunity, and I would never stand in the way of it.
It means the entire summer apart.
But it's not like I can't come visit.
Rome is just two glasses of chardonnay away.
Call her back.
It's not too late to change your mind.
I assure you, there's no need to worry.
The police were never there.
The entire thing was a false alarm.
Your wife will not find out.
And if you are indeed headed for a third divorce, it will not be due to this.
Nope, no bother at all.
Cheers.
I want you out of here today.
After all the fun we've had together? What would people think if they knew about your side business? Is that a threat? Because I am your main financial backer, and we did sleep together-- sometimes right here in these offices.
So exposing me would only embarrass "The Spectator" and you.
Then I'll find another way.
You've done nothing but spread lies and cause trouble since you arrived.
I wanna actually build something here, and I can't do that with you around.
You have no idea what I've gone through to legitimize myself.
I've worked hard for this paper, and I'm not about to step aside.
And as for my other business, I'm really more of a figurehead now.
Darling, don't look so disturbed.
There are far worse things than being stuck with the likes of me.
Guess what I found out this morning.
B.
, I know what you're gonna say, but first, I really wanna tell you-- Dan turned down the opportunity to spend the summer in Rome with the world's literary luminaries.
And do you know why? Because he's scared of leaving me here with Chuck.
Can you believe it? Sort of.
I mean, the most important thing in a relationship is trust.
After s*x.
And hygiene.
And earning potential.
Wait.
W-what did you think I was going to say? Oh, n--I mean, no, it's not important.
Nowhere near as important as Dan and Italy and his trust issues.
We should go get coffee, and you should tell me more about it.
Wait.
Okay.
Using a very generous grading curve and rounding up because I like your outfit, that lie was a C-plus at best.
What is going on? It's something I've been wanting to talk to you about for a while now.
I've been posting on "Gossip Girl" as Gossip Girl For a couple of months now.
What? How is that possible? When Georgina left town, she gave me her laptop, and it had a direct link to the "Gossip Girl" server, passwords, the software, everything.
S.
, you had me at "Georgina.
" But I can't believe it.
W-why didn't you tell me? I don't know.
I felt like it was something I had to keep secret from everyone.
I mean, my best friend, even.
I-I know it was wrong, and I'm so sorry.
I mean, I could've helped.
Sealing fates, forging destinies Like an imperious Greek goddess, imposing her will on the guileless masses.
But I was wondering why Gossip Girl was being so nice to me lately.
And a little off her game.
No offense.
Wait, so--so you're not mad? I am furious with you for not sharing your good fortune and omnipotence.
But right now I have to go replace my mother's La Mer before she returns from Paris and discovers that I've used it all.
Wait.
Let me do that for you-- my first act of contrition.
Please.
You think I'm cashing in your "Gossip Girl" guilt chip on some overpriced eye cream? I'll think of something more useful.
It's not like I planned any of it.
I needed help, so I contacted an old friend.
Diana Payne.
In her line of work, she has a network of influential contacts throughout the world.
She utilized them to keep me safe and hidden.
She also kept me informed.
When you needed blood, we had to act fast.
She snuck me back into the country so I could provide it for you.
Thank you for that.
There's just so much I wanna know.
I guess now we have time.
You can tell me everything.
Unfortunately, I'm afraid our time is up.
If the man I'm hiding from were to discover I was still alive, he'd try and kill me again.
Or go after you.
Let's go after him.
All you need to know is that as long as I'm still around, we're all in danger.
I was supposed to leave last night, but my departure was delayed because of the commotion you and your friends caused.
It was wonderful to get to see you again.
It's something I didn't think I'd ever be able to do.
But I'm afraid you have to go now.
What what is this? You're kicking me out? And then what? You go and you disappear? Leave me alone again? It's for your own safety.
I'm sorry.
Thank you for meeting me.
What can I do for you, Chuck? I just found out from an extremely reliable source someone else was after my father right before his death.
I want to know who it was.
That was years ago.
Why would a source come to you now? Just look into it.
I'll triple your usual fee if you can get me a name by noon.
I'm sorry.
I can't help you with this.
Not only am I on assignment, but frankly, this seems like a waste of both our time.
If you won't help me, I'll find someone who can.
Sometimes, looking for answers only leads to more questions.
Serena, hey.
Is Blair up there? No, she had to run an errand.
I just, uh, I have some news I wanna surprise her with.
And sometimes, you're better off not knowing.
Chuck? I can't really be seen with you right now.
But how are you doing? Are you okay? Far from it.
I have to find a way to stop my father from leaving tonight.
Leaving? But you just found him.
He left to keep me safe.
Now it's my turn to save him.
Is there anywhere you have to be right now? But the best way to avoid giving an answer is to avoid the question altogether.
Is my mother back? Did she notice the eye cream already? No, it's actually Dan.
He's waiting her with big news to surprise you with.
I'm with Chuck.
B.
No, it's not like that.
He needs me.
He's going through an extremely difficult time right now.
Yeah, of course he is, especially if it means taking you away from Dan to be with him.
And you just told me Dan is having trust issues.
I know, but this is life or death.
And other than not being able to say where I am, what I'm doing, or who I'm waiting for, I honestly have nothing to hide.
Well, Dan needs you, too, and you can't be two places at once.
You're right.
I'll be right there.
Whatever news he has, I'm sure it won't take too long to relay.
Chuck I'm sorry.
I want to stay, but something came up.
Do you mind if I Diana will see you now.
I can handle this part on my own.
Thanks for waiting with me.
I don't suppose you came here to thank me? Thank you for what? Not telling me my father was alive, pretending to be my mother, or screwing my best friend? You mean for keeping your father alive, pretending to be your mother to protect him, and well, I don't expect you to thank me for Nate.
Perhaps I should thank you for that one.
Look, I'm not here to hug it out or bond over my father's resurrection.
I just need your help in keeping him here.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
I think it is.
You've been helping him hide.
I think you know who from.
Who tried to kill my father? I know it was one of his competitors, someone powerful enough to scare him into hiding these last few years.
I just want a name.
Does your father know you're here? If you really wanna help him, help me put an end to this.
If I do agree-- and only if-- you can never say who told you.
And I'll need something else from you.
It's not a small request.
The price is no concern.
I need this to happen as fast as possible.
Make them an offer they can't say no to, and offer them more.
Make this happen now.
Hungry? Thirsty.
Blair asked me to come check on you.
Everything okay? Blair asked you to do that? Oh, I owe her a favor or 12.
I don't need a babysitter.
Besides He already has one.
I am so sorry! Serena told me you were waiting.
I had to go to five different stores to find the right eye cream.
No, don't worry about it.
I was just catching up on some reading, which is actually for you.
A Rome travel guide? Yeah, I talked to Alessandra, who talked to the people at the program, and they said I can still go to Rome if I want.
But the best part is, you can come with me.
Wow.
All summer? Yeah.
We would have to meet with an alumnus from the program since the chairwoman is already on her way back to Italy.
You know, I mean, it's a small group, so they have to vet everyone's plus-one.
Of course.
It sounds reasonable.
Only thing is, the interview would have to be today since it's so last-minute.
So what do you think? Huh, spend the summer with me in Italy? What is she doing here? Has she come to you for help? Nathaniel, can I speak with you privately? Just a moment, please.
Take your time.
You still want her out, right? Yes.
Lola and I are coming up with a plan.
There's no need to scheme.
I've taken care of it.
There's a paper in London which is in need of a face-lift.
I've arranged for Diana to take it over at a bargain basement price.
Wait.
She didn't want to leave.
What else did you promise her? That you wouldn't expose her previous profession.
Let her leave with her reputation still in tact.
So she gets everything she wants? Where's the justice in that? There's justice in getting what we want you wanted Diana out.
I got her out.
And it's good business for me.
Now all I need to do is finalize the deal.
Hey, B.
, Diana's here and so is Nate.
It's super tense.
You have to tell me what's going on.
I can't, S.
I'm sorry.
But text me what Chuck's mood is like when they leave.
That way, I'll know if I'm needed.
Oh, hey.
What--what was Dan's big surprise? It was more of an ambush.
He got into this writing program in Rome, and he wants me to go with him the whole summer.
Oh, how dare he! Blair, that's amazing.
I told him I had to check my calendar to buy some time to think.
Oh, what's there to think about? Rome for the summer sounds like a dream.
Well, not for Romans.
The whole place will be crawling with Americans.
And you can be two of them.
But it's a big decision, and after spending last summer at Louis' side, I was hoping to do my own thing.
So your indecision has nothing to do with Chuck? Absolutely not.
My concern for him at this time is about something entirely unrelated.
Which you can't tell me about.
B.
, I hate being out of the loop.
Come on! It's simply not up to me to tell.
Sorry.
But text me with updates as to how he's doing.
Hey.
Hey.
So is she taking the offer? Getting everything she wants.
She's done nothing but lie to us.
Now she's being rewarded for it.
Well, at least she'll be gone soon.
Yeah.
We should probably warn London.
I mean, she's gonna be playing the exact same games over there, and there's not a thing we can do to stop her.
Maybe we can.
Chuck agreed that you wouldn't out Diana's secret.
But he didn't say anything about me.
So what's the verdict? I'm in.
Great! I'll call the liaison with the program to see when he can come over.
After all your father's done to protect you, I would hate to see this end in tragedy.
Are you sure you want to know who tried to kill him? Yes, I'm sure.
And we have a deal.
All right, then.
Mason Nevins.
One of your father's fiercest competitors with known ties to organized crime And a liking for twins.
I don't care about his s*x life.
Ah, but you should.
He's quite the family man, demands the utmost discretion.
Now I'm scheduled for two of my girls to pay him a visit.
If someone were to catch him in the act, that someone would have extremely valuable blackmail material.
If your father knew, I doubt he'd approve.
Which is why not telling him is part of the deal.
Right.
Standing appointment.
The James Hotel, skyline suite.
4:00 P.
M.
He's gonna come alone.
He doesn't want anyone to know about this.
And that includes his henchmen.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Mm, that's odd.
It's my friend from the "Times.
" She can't possibly know about our little deal yet-- unless my phone is tapped, which I wouldn't put past her.
Hang on.
Marlene, darling.
How are you? You don't say.
An anonymous tip? Yes, I suppose that would be quite the scandal, if it were true, but hang on.
The deal is off, and you can forget about using my girls.
Marlene, you can't say a word of this to anybody They say the truth will set you free, but some truth comes at a price.
What have you done? Okay, someone has to tell me what's going on here.
We couldn't let her get away without any consequences.
She's done nothing but deceive all of us, including you.
It just wasn't right.
Yeah, we're sorry we messed up your deal, but this was beyond business.
It was personal.
You no idea how personal.
I made that deal with her so she would help get my father out of hiding.
Wait.
Your father-- you mean Jack? Bart.
He's alive.
The bone, Dorota? Really? Our guest is Italian.
I don't think that beige plates are very la dolce vita.
You don't think this is-- this is too much? And it's just an interview with one person.
Well, we want to impress him, right? I think they're just trying to make sure we're a sane, stable couple.
I-I guess they've had some trouble in the past.
Apparently, Padma Lakshmi and Salman Rushdie broke up during their stay And it caused all kinds of drama.
Oh.
Uh You know what? You're right.
This is all wrong.
Yeah, it's a little overboard.
No, it's not enough.
We don't want pastries.
We want gelato.
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa.
But it's important for us to show how much we love Italian culture, and what says that better than gelato? I go get gelato, miss Blair.
No.
It's okay.
I will do it, Dorota.
You never get the right flavors anyway.
No one likes pistachio anything.
But, you know, we have an hour.
I'll be back in plenty of time, I promise.
So all these years, he never made any attempt to contact you? Or my mom? Too risky.
If my memory serves me right, Lily was in the process of leaving him for Rufus.
He only came out of hiding to save me after the accident.
I was hoping to return the favor, but your little girlfriend ruined that plan when she exposed Diana.
I hope she feels justice has been served because she cost me my father.
Hey, ease up.
She didn't know about Bart. None of us did.
Well, is there anything we can do to help?
I'm not sure.
Once this guy shows up, and Diana's girls aren't there, he's gonna know something isn't right.
I need to come up with a new plan fast.
You don't need a new plan.
You just need new girls.
And since you have a Juilliard actress at your disposal, and one who wants to fix what she broke I'm sure she'd love the chance to make things right.
Wonderful.
Just tell her it's a non-union job.
While we rehearse, you go after Diana and make sure she doesn't cancel her client's appointment.
We don't want to put on a show to an empty house.
Hurry.
We only have an hour.
You're gonna need every minute I can spare.
Bart, it's Diana.
Start getting ready.
You're leaving earlier than scheduled, and I'm coming with you.
Oh, and I hope you've got that check for me.
Where is she? We have to get going.
You said you needed twins, right? Or at least two blondes around the same height.
Ivy owes me.
I'll do whatever it takes to help.
I'd love to get back in the gang.
But just to clarify, in order to be "back in the gang", you would've had to be in the gang to begin with.
We don't need Ivy.
I can do it.
After all, B.
, you have that thing you need to get to.
Actually, I have a different acting job for you-- a part you know better than anyone.
Mr.
Daniel Humphrey, this Mr.
Emilio Pivano.
Thank you for coming on--on such short notice.
It's a pleasure to meet an esteemed alumnus of the program.
I read your book.
Not a bad debut.
Easy to see the potential.
Thank you.
How many people were you expecting? Only you.
Uh, that's just my girlfriend Blair.
She loves variety and themes.
In fact, funny story-- um, being that the program is in Rome, she wanted us to have gelato, so she--she went out to get some since we didn't have any here.
Knowing, uh, miss Blair, she go to Chelsea market for best gelato in city.
And, I mean, what--what says "Italy" better than, uh, gelato? Sh-she'll--she'll be-- she'll be back in just a moment.
Sorry I'm late.
I got stuck in traffic.
Babe, I'm sorry.
Hi.
I'm Blair Waldorf.
So nice to meet you.
Looks like S.
is B.
S.
ing as B.
Let's hope this works.
There's no place like Rome.
Where is the gelato? I actually didn't even like him at first.
I thought that he was annoying and unpopular and from Brooklyn.
And I would, uh, antagonize him on a daily basis.
We--we really couldn't stand each other for years.
But it's like a movie now, you know, because we're just madly in love.
Mm, n-not--not that madly.
It's a--it's a-- it's a calm, stable love.
We're--we're very secure in it.
We don't have to worry about it.
Yeah, yeah, it's like we were meant to be.
Mm.
Like Brad and Angelina once they got rid of Jennifer.
Yeah, I mean, not that dramatic.
Obviously, there was no Jennifer.
You'll have to excuse Blair.
She's not really feeling herself today.
You know, the point is, if Dan is in Rome, I wanna be in Rome.
That sounds wonderful.
You two make an interesting couple.
Uh, excuse me one moment.
I have to take this call.
Where the hell is Blair? If she didn't want to come to Rome with me, she should've just said so.
Something came up.
Is she with Chuck? No.
Of course not.
She's with Eleanor.
But she knows how important this is to you, and she wants to go, so she sent me in her place.
Well, you're not really helping.
He just said we make an interesting couple.
Not in a good way.
I cannot believe that Blair would do this.
What could be more important? I handpicked these myself.
You really want us to wear one of those? If it helps to get into character.
Or you can have him choose your outfits and stay clothed for now.
Okay.
When Nevins shows up, take charge immediately.
Remember, you are pros.
You call the shots.
What if he wants to touch us? SWAT his hand away and tell him "no.
" Treat him like the dog he is.
How do you know this will work? You think this is the first time I've entrapped someone with prostitutes? Every good girl has a pair.
Now when the time is right, Chuck will burst in and take pictures, and then your work here is done.
Oh.
And if you get his clothes off before you cuff him to the bed, it'll make things a lot easier.
What are you doing here? Came to say a proper good-bye.
Sorry.
Short on time.
Besides, what about your girlfriend? That's not what I meant.
Your friend from the "Times" is on her way here now.
She seems interested in hearing what I have to say.
Why would she believe you? I made a copy of your day planner.
I can explain the code.
You don't understand.
I have to reach Bart.
As if you care about anyone but yourself.
Nate I made several bad choices early on in life.
But I wanted to escape that world and start fresh.
"The Spectator" is my shot at doing that, and being here with you it's the happiest I've ever been.
I don't believe you.
You lied to me from the moment we randomly met in Los Angeles, and you're lying to me now.
I never lied about my feelings to you.
I think in your heart you know that.
Nate, I can't go back to my old life, and I stand no choice of starting a new one with my name in the headlines.
Must you keep me here to humiliate me on top of all that? I apologize for cutting this short, but I think we've covered everything.
Um, thank you for coming by.
I'm sorry if we wasted your time.
Not your fault.
Lucia insisted we do this.
But I'm sure you'll both have a nice time in Rome.
Just watch out for pickpockets.
Che bastardi.
Wait a second.
I'm sorry.
Are you--are you saying that, uh, we got in? Of course.
This was just a formality, and if I didn't have a deadline to meet for my new novel, I would love to sit around and chat more with you guys.
You really do make a lovely couple.
A lot of energy, that one.
Hello.
I'm Eleanor Waldorf.
Oh.
You have a lovely daughter.
I can see where she gets her beauty from.
Okay, thank you so much for coming, but don't forget that deadline, buddy.
Serena, how are you? Hello! I am good.
Thank you.
Uh, wh-where's Blair? I haven't seen her yet.
Excuse me.
So what if we, like, lay down on the bed in a in a sexy pose? Yeah.
But I don't know.
Maybe we could just, like, stand here and look sexy.
When we were doing all those crazy exercises in acting class, who would have thought that we'd end up here? Holding an imaginary orange in our hands.
Oh, God.
He's here.
Break a leg.
Whatever.
Are you Diana's girls? Strip down to your underwear and get on the bed.
You don't understand.
We heard you like it rough.
What do you want your safe word to be? I am not the client.
Chuck sent me.
You're in danger, and so is Bart.
Nevins got wise to your plan.
Chuck's on his way to see Bart now, and we're supposed to regroup there.
He said that you would know the way.
I do, yeah.
Well, good, 'cause we really need to go.
Come on.
Chuck. Chuck!
I wish you would have told me earlier you were having your P.I.
take the pictures.
I told the girls you would be doing it.
I am.
What are you talking about? Andrew Tyler.
I saw him get into an elevator as I came down.
You didn't send him? I didn't send Andrew anywhere.
Lola? Ivy? Where could they have gone? Uh-oh, Chuck.
You might need to have your private investigator investigated.
So I'm a little confused.
First, Blair says she's running out to get gelato, and then you say she's with Eleanor, and then Eleanor says she hasn't seen Blair all day.
So where's Blair? She's with Chuck.
I knew it.
I know it's hard, Dan, but you're gonna have to trust her.
How am I supposed to trust her around Chuck when I know she doesn't love me? I mean, that's the real reason she doesn't wanna come away with me.
I'm sorry.
That's--I-I should talk about this to someone else.
No, I-I can handle it.
I told Blair I loved her, and she didn't say it back.
Oh, Dan, you know how many times she's been burned by that word.
First, Chuck took a year to say it, and then Louis said it too soon.
I know how much she cares about you.
She may not have said it then, but she will.
Even if that is true, that doesn't change the fact that she lied to me.
This lie is different.
It's It's life or death.
Come on.
I know you Upper East Siders are partial to hyperbole, but it's-- Not this time.
Bart Bass is alive.
What? Chuck? Bart? Hello? Well, this is the room he was in yesterday.
Maybe he changed rooms.
You stay here.
We'll go check.
How about I come with you-- for protection? Oh, wait.
Here he comes.
What the Surprised to see me? Until you found out I was still alive.
Leave us.
You were the last person I saw before the accident.
You got out of the car right before it happened.
When Blair told me she saw you at the hotel earlier, I started thinking.
It wasn't a competitor that tried to kill him.
It was you.
You hired me to gather intel on Nevins, and I did.
A lot of it.
But he found out, and he threatened me and my family.
It was either you or them, so I turned.
Told him I'd work for him.
And to prove my loyalty, I helped get you out of the way.
I told 'em where you'd be-- in the car, and they told me when to get out.
Did you get all that? Every word.
Officers? I guess now the police know the truth.
You'll be sticking around.
When you care about someone, you want them to stay.
Come in.
Someone from the "Times" is here.
Yeah, tell her Diana's already gone, and she took her book day planner with her.
But sometimes, showing you care means letting them go.
Hi.
Hey.
How'd everything go? Pretty great, considering.
Bart Bass is alive and safe.
Chuck stayed up there with him.
They're talking to the police.
And Ivy and Lola? You would have been proud, if you liked either of them.
But if Lola hadn't texted where they were going, we might not have ever beat them up there.
Well, maybe I should give her some more credit.
Well, thanks for covering for me with Dan.
I called him on the way back.
He said we're going to Italy.
Well, that's great news, isn't it? Of course.
I I just hope they're not disappointed with the real Blair Waldorf when they meet her.
Oh, they never could be.
But you should probably know you volunteered to teach English at a local school while you're there.
Well, I guess I can't spend all my time shopping on the Via Condotti.
You could only stare up at the Sistine Chapel for so long.
Thanks, S.
You really are my best friend.
Hmm.
I love you, B.
I love you, too.
Speaking of which, maybe it's time to tell Dan how you feel about him? He told you about that? I'm not ready.
I really want the next person I say it to, to be the last.
You're packing to come home, right? Right.
Now that we have Tyler's confession, we can get Nevins.
And I can show my face again.
I wanna thank you, son.
I didn't think this was gonna be possible, but the way you took control, got me out of this mess, makes me think I did something right in raising you.
I think we both know you didn't raise me.
You were too busy with all those inappropriate transient women to teach me any viable life lessons Except those about inappropriate transient women.
I will have to lay low, hire security.
We'll take care of it together, like a family.
Speaking of which, what about Lily? Have you thought about how you wanna break the news to her? I'm not sure.
My relationship with Lily was on the rocks.
You and I were going through a difficult time.
Maybe hiding all these years was easier than facing things head-on.
Well How about we try group therapy next time instead? So how did Diana get away? What did she do, go out the window? Wouldn't put it past her.
But whatever happened, I don't think we'll see her again.
Oh, good.
Then I get your full attention.
Yeah.
Blair, it's three months.
We can't--we can't spend the entire summer living at the Hotel de Russie.
Well, of course not.
We also have to stay at the Portrait Suites, which is right above Ferragamo.
Of course.
That may be more for me.
Do you really wanna spend the entire summer with me in Rome? Chuck's dad is alive.
That is gonna change his world deeply.
His, yes, but not mine.
I understand why you did what you did today, but I need to know, for me, for us What is really happening here? There is nothing I want more than to spend the summer right by your side.
Where are you going? I just realized that somebody should probably break the news about Bart to my dad.
Well, then I will start researching restaurants.
We have 3 months.
That's 90 days, which is 270 meals.
I may need to create a spreadsheet.
You want camomile tea before bed, miss Serena? I just make for miss Eleanor, catch up on all the gossip, watch "Toddlers & Tiaras.
" Please, no more tiaras of any kind.
You have smile in eyes.
It's so nice to see you away from that computer.
Yeah, the computer's gone, and I finally feel like I'm getting my life back, and my friends back, too.
Feels good.
Oh.
It's probably Blair now.
Evening, Upper East Siders.
Many of you have complained I've been too kind to S.
and B.
these last few months.
But all of that's about to change because I've got a page from Blair Waldorf's diary, where she tells all about who's really in her heart.
And there's lots more where that came from, courtesy of her B.
F.

, Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Bart.
He's alive.
What about Lily? Have you thought about how you wanna break the news to her? Where exactly are you gonna find some other Upper East Side woman to take care of you the way I have? You just made my decision for us to spend some time apart that much easier.
I'm with Chuck.
He needs me.
He's going through an extremely difficult time right now.
My computer is gone.
Gossip Girl.
She took it.
How do you know that? Either way, it's over.
The real Gossip Girl is back.
Do you really wanna spend the entire summer with me in Rome? There is nothing I want more.
I've got a page from Blair Waldorf's diary where she tells all about who's really in her heart.
Good morning, Upper East Siders.
How do you look today? You know image is everything.
Oh, it's so great to hear from you, David.
I would love to work together on another movie.
Yeah, I'll look out for my premiere invitation.
See you then.
Bye.
But under those perfect clothes and perfect smiles, everyone has their not-so-perfect secrets.
I take it you've decided to ask Lola to move in for the summer.
She sleeps herr every night.
I wanna see her every day.
I figure, why not? This place could use a woman's touch.
Couldn't we all.
Lucky for me, nothing can stay hidden forever.
Have you heard from Lily? No.
Nothing.
Whether the truth's in a diary or the daily news Once it's out, it will change everything.
Let the chips fall where they may along with the husbands and boyfriends.
It's bad enough you read my diary, but to publically expose my naked thoughts is unconscionable! B.
, I was never gonna publish them.
I just wanted to know that I could.
I was upset about you and Dan.
And I'm so sorry.
I never thought Gossip Girl would steal my computer with everything on it.
Well, I took Dan's phone just so he wouldn't see anything.
But I'm just postponing the inevitable if she keeps releasing pages.
I wouldn't worry about Dan.
He's a writer.
He knows that diaries are all about exploring your thoughts.
Like all terrible things you said about me that's not how you really feel.
It is now.
Oh! "Another day of wedding planning where my mother needs to make me small so she can be the star.
" There goes that relationship! No big deal! Who needs a mother?! You better find a way to stop this before I lose everyone I ever cared about.
I will, right away.
Dorota! We need to find every damning thing I ever wrote so we can be proactive about damage control.
Every damning thing since grade school is a lot of damning.
Do you wanna steam laundry in Siberia? Mobilize the troops! Hey.
Hey.
I know you wanna talk to me about something, but can I go first? Yeah, sure.
What's going on? I got a job as a swing in the touring company of "Wicked.
" A swing? What's that? Like a part or a prop? It's like an understudy but for a lot of characters.
Ah.
It's not exactly my dream, but with my mom in jail, it solves my summer housing problem.
Well, I know housing's an issue, but you don't have to leave New York.
I don't want to leave you either, but even if I could afford to stay here, I'd never find an acting job that paid enough.
It's best option.
I have to get to my fitting, okay? All right, well, I, um oh! You wanted to talk.
I'm sorry.
I'll come over as soon as I'm done, okay? I appreciate everything F.
H.
P.
did for Stella.
I'm just not sure that it's the right path for me.
All right, talk soon.
Blair, darling, why is Dorota carrying your life history? Suffice it to say that I apologize in advance if any of your meetings today are negatively affected by the publication of my intimate musings.
Thank you.
"My mother considers herself an arbiter of Parisian style, but the only French she is intimate with are fries.
" Well The reflections of an over privileged and unattended 13-year-old have no bearing on the business I'm in town for, which I have to discuss with you.
I would love to, just as soon as I get my own business in order.
Oh.
Pages with foot and mouth already marked from "K" to 6.
What are you waiting for? Every minute is another bridge burned.
Why should we help you when you called us "back of house"? That was you.
Um, she says my hair is as thick as Jessica Simpson's.
That says "head.
" You should be grateful that your names are mentioned at all.
That guy spent one week with Marilyn, and he is still living off the royalties.
Your grandchildren will brag that their ancestors were belittled by Blair Waldorf.
Fine.
What do we have to do? Hey.
If you're calling to yell at me about Blair's diary, I-I know.
I'm sorry.
I-I know I deserve it.
But I am doing everything I can to get Gossip Girl to stop posting any more of it.
Wait a second.
Gossip Girl has Blair's diary? That's not why you're calling? No, no.
Uh, my dad was trying to reach Lily, and I was wondering if you'd spoken to her since Bart's resurrection.
No, I left her a couple messages last night, but I haven't heard from her.
I'm sorry.
I have to go deal with this Blair thing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, about that just be the bigger person and don't read any of them.
Stay off "Gossip Girl," okay? - - Serena hasn't heard from Lily? No, she hasn't.
Is that Lily getting back to you? No, it's my lawyer.
I asked him to find out what Bart's reappearance means to my marriage.
And? "Lily and Bart never got a divorce, so technically they're still married.
" Wait, wait, wait.
What? One of Lily's marriages has to be annulled.
I wanna make sure it's not mine.
I gotta go.
Deceiving you was the only way to keep you and Chuck safe.
If I had known, maybe we could've done things differently.
You mean you would've come with me.
Please.
You were getting ready to leave me for Rufus.
I'm sorry for that.
I should've had more respect for our marriage.
What about Charles? I mean, uh, his thinking you were dead was hell for him.
He got through it, though, with your help.
He told me about the adoption, Lily.
I owe you everything for that.
Charles is family.
And even with you back, he's mine, too.
And now here we are, technically still married, with a son that we legally share.
Oh.
I can't deny the fact there's a part of me that would Like to move back in here, repair the damage to our relationship a great deal of which I am responsible for.
You know, Bart, I have some wonderful memories I know.
I know.
You've moved on.
You are happily married to Rufus.
I'm sorry.
It was foolish of me to think that you'd ever choose me over him.
Status report.
Penelope social suicide watch.
The Met's not gonna be happy.
Make a donation.
Also include the ballet, opera.
Skip M.
O.
M.
A.
Tim Burton isn't art.
I stand by that statement.
Jessica, you are on restaurants.
I need to be able to eat in this town again.
Start by apologizing at per se and work your way down to Boulud Sud.
Kati, regarding fashion, tell Diane that when I said her wraps looked like they were for falafels, that I meant it as a compliment.
What could be more interesting than saving my future? Your past.
This is all Serena's fault! She said she would fix it.
It just made it worse.
Go.
Not you.
I have a new task for you.
I'm not comfortable kissing Dan.
I'll manage matters of my heart.
You find every secret Serena has.
I need the best one, to destroy her.
I just hope Chuck and Dan don't see this.
For my father's press conference this afternoon, make sure you only have hard sources the "Times," "The Journal.
" No Perez.
What is it? "This new romance with Dan is fun, but is cultural stimulation enough? What if I never love anyone more than I Chuck?" Looks like someone forgot a "d" at the end of that word.
Guess we just answered who is in Blair's heart.
Question is, is there room for two? Dan? Hello, it's me! Do you want to come with me to the Shepherds' divorce party tonight? I should've known that marriage was doomed when Serena banged my boyfriend at the reception.
You saw "Gossip Girl.
" You wanna reimburse me for my new phone? 'Cause I'm assuming it's you who took the old one.
I swear, it was just a fleeting thought that I jotted down the day before our hotel room incident.
And drunk elevator s*x changed all that.
I would have edited it out of my biography had it not already been posted for posterity.
What you wrote wasn't about s*x.
It was about your feelings.
My feelings about our impending s*x, which no longer apply.
Blair, I told you I loved you, and you pretended like you didn't even hear me.
Well, Dan, let's just put all that behind us.
Y-you're you're doing it again.
Do you even want to be in this relationship? Of course.
Is the reason you can't say you love me because You're still in love with Chuck? No.
Then I need to know how do you feel about me, by tonight.
Dan.
We're supposed to be spending the summer in Italy together, and I don't want you coming unless I know where we stand.
Sorry that took so long.
I'm here to talk now.
There's actually someone you need to talk to first.
Dad! Your roommate said I would find you here.
You look great.
Oh.
Well, is everything okay? Did something happen with mom's case? No, I'm afraid her future is still pretty uncertain.
But I don't want yours to be, so I've arranged for Carol's half of Cece's estate to be transferred to you.
This is a lot of money.
You know what it means, right? I can pay for school.
And not be an Oompa Loompa understudy.
You can stay in New York And live with me.
Did you just ask me to move in with you? I believe he did.
You can say no if you want, but you can't make the excuse that you don't fit into my world anymore.
It's your world now, too.
Well, this is my mom's money.
I can't make any decisions until I talk to her.
Rufus, you're looking well.
I see the transition from Brooklyn to the big-time has done you wonders.
I'm, uh, not here for small talk.
I just need you to sign these annulment papers.
So Lily has chosen to end our marriage in order to save yours? She made her choice three years ago when she decided to leave you for me.
Nothing's changed since then.
Maybe I have.
All that time in hiding made me realize what's really important.
What does what does that mean exactly? That if Lily's happiness depends on my signature on these, you will have them by the end of the day.
Thank you.
I just got off the phone with David O.
Russell's assistant.
My invitation to the premiere was rescinded I've always found him an intelligent filmmaker.
Because Gossip Girl posted a diary page about how I never read "The Beautiful and Damned," so I just pretended to to get the job.
Well, maybe you should've considered that before you leaked my diary.
It wasn't in your diary.
Not the ones you found, but it was on the page I just wrote and e-mailed to Gossip Girl when I saw your invitation.
Blair, you knew how important that job was to me, and and I was on the verge of getting another one.
Summer job on a film set versus exposing all my secrets.
No, I'm not sorry.
"I'll never love Chuck again after what he did tonight.
He's a monster.
He deserves to be alone forever.
" I was waiting for that one.
You happy now, now that I'm as alone as you are? Well, I'm only alone because of you.
You you had your prince and you had Chuck.
You didn't need to take Dan, too.
I didn't "take" Dan.
That's not how relationships work.
You would know that if you'd grown up at all since high school.
Oh, come on, Blair.
You're the one who can't move on.
You you're still in love with Chuck and you still won't admit it.
Get out.
I mean it.
I want you gone for good.
Pack your things.
You can't hold me responsible for everything bad in your life.
I can because you are.
The best time I ever had was when you were gone six years ago.
Leave your key with Dorota.
Well, it's about time William gave you my money.
I was starting to worry he'd made some secret alliance with Lily.
Oh.
I guess it just took a while to arrange everything.
But now we can hire you a great defense lawyer.
I already have one.
Abrams & Weil took my case pro bono last week.
Apparently, one of the partners read about me in the New York social diary.
Just out of the blue like that? Mm-hmm.
Wow.
Well, that's great, mom.
Then why aren't you smiling? This money is a good thing.
Go tell Nate you'll move in with him.
Don't turn your back on the life that I almost screwed up for you.
I am proud of you, son.
Lily told me you'd stepped up, but I had no idea how much you accomplished.
Thank you.
How was seeing Lily after all this time? I never dealt with such a formidable woman.
Made me regret not treating her better.
They do require dedication.
I assume you're talking about Blair Waldorf.
But you two aren't back together? I made a lot of mistakes after you left.
I lost my temper.
I lost myself.
When I finally realized what I'd done and I had the ring to propose, I I was too late.
And then she married a prince.
Now she's with Dan Humphrey.
Or at least I think she is.
I don't really know how she feels about either of us.
So what are you waiting for? Chances like this don't come around by often.
And no one does a grand, romantic gesture better than a bass.
Of course I didn't have anything to do with your mother's new lawyer.
Carol still won't speak to me.
But if you need any help paying their fees, I'll contribute.
Everyone deserves a defense.
Well, the firm is working for free.
And if I needed money, I have my mom's half of Cece's estate.
That's right.
William uh, well, your father mentioned that.
Excuse me, miss Lily.
I have delivery from your attorney.
Thank you, Vanya.
Bye.
- - Is everything okay? I'm not sure.
Would you mind letting yourself out? - Make sure they know the Q&A will be limited to ten minutes only on specified subjects.
That's all for now.
What are you doing here? I came to check on you.
Gossip Girl's been putting a bunch of stuff up, and I wanted to make sure that you weren't hurt.
Why would I be hurt about something that was in your diary a year ago? We've been through so much since then, talked about everything, made amends.
Or is there some other reason you're here? Maybe to tell me you and Dan broke up? No.
We haven't.
I can't play this game anymore, Blair.
I spent the whole year waiting for you.
I need to move forward with my life now.
Of course.
You're right.
Unless there's something else you need to say.
I have to go.
Blair's dirty work can wait.
She fired me.
I'm on my way to meet everyone at Michael Jordan's steakhouse for the Shepherd" divorce party.
Oh, well, there's been a change of plans.
You're not going to that, and neither is Blair, and you and your friends are going to see to it.
That's the problem with hired help.
They'll work for anyone.
You look just as beautiful in black as you did white.
Oh! Hey.
You look dapper.
Oh, thank you.
You look beautiful.
Blair texted me that she would be here, so I'm I'm feeling a little bit better.
Then you should probably stay off "Gossip Girl.
" Why? Did I miss another diary post? She was just spotted at the empire.
Come on, she's probably just telling Chuck that that it's over between them for good, and I bet she's on her way here now.
Come on, let's go get you an "ale-imony" while we wait.
Hey.
I appreciate you doing all this.
It's important that the world know you're back.
To new partnerships.
Speaking of which You didn't need to buy me a gift.
Actually, you bought it.
I was at Harry Winston, picking up an apology trinket for Lily.
Helene told me it was in the vault.
I thought you might want it back.
Why? Well, isn't Blair still the most important thing in your life? Where's that last grand gesture we spoke of earlier? Maybe I'll just hold on to it.
Lily.
What a present surprise.
Charles, do you mind if I speak to your father alone? I'll tell everyone we need a few more minutes.
I can't believe how much more grown up you are at your age than I was.
I suppose it's the divorce, and all the other mistakes you've already made.
Well, it won't get easier any time soon.
I'm headed for a reckoning Dan vs.
Chuck.
Ooh.
You always did love Jane Austen.
As literature, not my life! Dan is my best friend.
When we're together, it's great.
I feel strong and safe except in his neighborhood.
And with Chuck? I'm vulnerable.
Oh.
H's devastated me, but He's also made me happier than I've ever been.
I-I just don't know which kind of love is better.
You probably think I'm pathetic for even caring.
If I was truly powerful, I'd be content without any man at all.
Well, even moguls have hearts, my dear.
Trust me, Blair.
There isn't a woman out there more powerful than you are.
You really think so? Yes, I do.
That's why I want you to take over my company.
That's what I've been trying to talk to you about.
I have decided to retire, and I know you've always said you didn't want any part of what I do.
Well, have you seen my closet? Mm-hmm.
Fashion is art and culture and history and everything I love combined.
But I'm not a designer.
So your first order of business will be to find the right one to take over.
So what do you say? Will you do it? Will a real Waldorf woman carry on the name? Yes.
Of course yes! Oh! Hugs? What did I miss? Knock! Were you raised in a barn? What are you doing here? I dismissed you hours ago.
Then your diary said I was pathetic for showing up everything alone.
So I thought we could go to the Shepherd party together.
But is that what you're wearing? Serena just left here in exactly the same color scheme.
Give me a minute.
Mmm.
Two more prenup shots, please.
You know, maybe I should just text Blair.
No.
No, don't do that.
That will completely ruin the romance of her showing up to be with you.
What? *** what? What happened? I think I think Chuck is proposing to her.
Well, I'm I'm so sorry, Dan.
Well, maybe it's not what we think it is.
Or maybe if it is, maybe she's not gonna say "yes.
" After being rejected at Blair's wedding, I don't think Chuck would would ever make that move unless he was sure of her answer.
Well, then I wanna hear that from her.
Oh! Oh! Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
No, it's okay.
It's okay.
I know somewhere where we can dry off.
What are you still doing here? Waiting for Blair to change.
She left.
She went through Serena's room to avoid you.
I should've known we'd have communication problems when she stole my phone.
Sorry to interrupt your diatribe, but, um, can you unzip my dress? Don't worry.
There's a slip underneath.
I just can't get it dry like this.
Wh-where was I with my diatribe? Oh, right.
Communication.
She tells me that I never shut up, but she's the one that's always talking.
It's not like her to choose Chuck and not say anything.
Well, it's exactly like her, actually.
I'm sorry, I just I can't protect Blair any longer.
All she does is lie and scheme, and she's done nothing but hurt you all year.
I thought she'd changed.
She's never gonna change.
Don't you see, Dan? The Blair that you're in love with isn't the real Blair.
It's the one that you created in your book.
And she's always loved Chuck.
She just used you to get between us because she knew that I loved you.
Sorry to bother you before your press conference, but you said you wanted to be honest moving forward.
I want nothing more.
Was there a problem with the annulment papers? Oh, I was just surprised, uh, you didn't mention them when we spoke.
That's because Rufus brought them by after I saw you.
I just assumed it was because you'd decided to stay married to him.
I was only trying to honor your wishes, so I should've known you'd lure her here.
How'd you do it? Sob story? Diamond necklace? I should get to the press conference.
I'll give you two some privacy.
How dare you have annulment papers drawn up behind my back.
I tried to call you.
You didn't answer.
I wanted to give us a chance to work things out before Bart started causing problems.
Our problems long predate Bart's return.
You haven't spoken to me in weeks.
You've h you've had no interest in working on our marriage until you this as a competition with him.
He's manipulating you to choose him.
Well, you're wrong.
He signed the papers.
It'll be my choice who I stay married to, not yours.
I am pleased to announce that bass industries will now truly be a family business with the return of the man who taught me never to give up, even on the dead my father, Bart bass.
Thank you, son.
Thanks, mom.
I've made my choice.
I know who I need to be with.
I'm on my way to tell him now.
Of course, none of this would've been possible without my son Chuck.
So thank you, Chuck, for keeping my seat warm.
So starting today, I will be the only bass in bass industries.
Thank you.
Any questions? Some secrets even I couldn't see coming.
Bye-bye, baby bass.
I thought that went well.
What'd you want to discuss? You said this was a family business.
What happened to us being partners? You said partnership.
I said nothing and did what was best for my company.
The only reason this company still exists is because I saved it.
All I've done is work to protect your legacy.
And pine after Blair Waldorf.
Blair has nothing to do with the way I've handled this business.
You didn't try and trade her for a hotel deed? You didn't let everything fall apart when you ran away from her all the way to Europe? You didn't just three months ago almost bankrupt yourself trying to get her out of her marriage? I had hoped you had outgrown such foolish behavior, but you're still willing to throw everything away for a girl who's done nothing but toy with you.
And you proved that when you took that engagement ring.
You gave me it.
You encouraged me to win her back! It was a test to see if you were ready to be a bass, to do the things you need to do to be a great man, and you failed.
Failed? I got you out of hiding.
I took down your enemy.
I built this empire! No, no, no, no, the most you have done is used my money to redecorate.
Bass industries needs to be run by a man, not a boy.
You've never grown up.
Maybe you can start now.
Well, that was definitely not what I expected to happen tonight.
Not that it it was bad.
It wasn't.
Oh, don't sound so surprised.
We were always good together.
Yeah, we were, weren't we? Here.
That's weird.
Your camera's on.
Uh, no, no, it's not.
Whoa, I think it was recording us, actually.
Oh, gosh! Maybe I-I hit the button when I was cleaning up the spill.
Here, let me erase it.
You had Penelope keep Blair home? You knew that she wasn't with Chuck the whole time.
No.
No, that's that's not true.
She was spotted at the empire.
You saw that yourself.
You manipulated me into thinking that I was over so I would cheat on her.
Oh, come on, Dan, we both did this.
What were you gonna do with this? You gonna you gonna post this video on "Gossip Girl"? I gotta get out of here.
*** I don't know who you are anymore.
I'm sorry.
I don't need your pity.
I'm not here because I pity you.
I'm here because it's time I was honest with you.
I love you.
I'm in love with you.
I have tried to kill it, to run away from it, but I can't and I don't want to anymore.
So what? So now we can be together.
Isn't that what you want? It was, before I lost everything.
Bass industries isn't everything.
I'm gonna take over my mother's company, and It can be our future.
The only reason Waldorf Designs has a future is because I gave mine up for it.
My father was right.
I always put you first, and you bet against me every time.
Now I have nothing.
You have me.
That's not enough.
I need a future.
Then let me be part of it.
I don't want to be Mr.
Blair Waldorf.
I'm Chuck bass.
Poor B.
Now that she's revealed what's in her heart, guess these diary's days are dead, along with her happily ever after.
I'm off to meet Jack.
Turns out my father cut him out of the company, too.
I'm not surprised.
But are you sure you wanna partner with the guy? I need resources if I'm going to get back what I built and my father stole.
Nobody does resource management better than a vengeful Jack bass.
Good luck.
I'll see ya.
You sure you don't wanna come tour the northwest with me? A little fresh air might be good after your last few months.
I would love to hang out with you and nature, but I have worked too hard on "The Spectator" to leave it now.
So Well, I should go then.
I have to finish all the paperwork to donate Cece's estate before I fly out.
Wait.
Where did you decide to leave the money? I found a worthy cause.
Well, at least an annulment will be easier than a messy divorce.
You sure about this? I can only have one marriage, and this just isn't one anymore.
You okay? That didn't sound too easy.
Well, it's, um, a lot easier knowing how supportive you've been.
We both have a lot of making up to do.
I look forward to continuing the process this summer in the Hamptons.
I'm busy.
I never meant for you to get caught in the crossfire of my battle with Blair.
I deleted the video, so no one knows about it and no one got hurt.
And please don't act like you're innocent here.
I mean, it was mutual.
We both used each other.
I was trying to escape my own pain, and you were trying to destroy your best friend.
Those are two different things.
I'm sorry for how it happened, but I love you, Dan, and I don't think that you would've done what you did if you didn't still have feelings for me.
And now there's nothing standing in the way of us.
Serena, there is no "us.
" There's only you.
And and now that our parents are splitting up, I never have to see you again.
The French say, "plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.
" Sounds romantic.
Hey, can you meet me? I'm on my way.
But all it means is, "the more things change, the more they stay the same.
" Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
You have no idea how many signatures it took for me to get you this money.
Are you sure you wanna do this? Cece gave it to you.
I'm just giving it back.
Well, thank you.
If you ever need anything After Lily sabotaged my mom's defense, I just need you to keep our agreement.
Take down Lily.
I'm looking forward to it.
But I thought you were giving away your money so you didn't become like the rest of your family? I'm not.
You are.
Outsiders remain on the outside At least for now.
That is your third sigh since the seventh arrondissement.
Are you having regrets about leaving without speaking to Serena? Not at all.
Those were "I love Paris" sighs.
I can't wait to start discussing heel heights and hem lengths.
Good.
I wanna be sure that you're ready for this.
You don't have any loose ends to tie up back home? Nothing's holding me back anymore.
I know what I want, and I'm gonna get it.
The queen B.
Ascends to reign over a new kingdom Number 24 black.
Blackjack.
Puts us up $3 million.
Two more and we'll be able to buy our way into the only game that can really help us take down Bart bass.

Place your bet.
Stay at 17.
And the wild cards just keep getting Wilder.
This came from Diana Payne.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
Dan Humphrey.
Come to whisk me away for a rendezvous under the tuscan son? You're lucky you're on my free pass list.
Otherwise, Philip might've put up a fuss.
This invitation isn't about seduction, Georgina.
It's about scandal.
Can't a girl have both? I need your photographic memory and your passion for social upheaval to help me write the book about the Upper East Side the book I should've written from the beginning.
Mm, nothing like a scorned lover to scorch the earth.
I can hardly wait.
But even the same characters can start to play a new power game And old stars can cease to shine.
S.
Always said she wanted to be left alone.
Now she'll get her wish.
Damian sent me.
Do you have what I asked for? Damian said you like to party.
I'm Zeke, by the way.
I don't care what your name is.
As far as I'm concerned, Serena Van Der Woodsen doesn't exist.
Is there a seat available? Yes.
Take mine.
Thanks for the call.
You fought for me all year.
I've come to fight for you.
Will you be joining the game? You said I always bet against you, but this time, I'm all in.
Your bet, sir? What did I say about letting the chips fall where they may? See you next fall.
X.
O.
X.
O, Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Blair, I just got invited to the Institute of Arts and Letters' summer artists retreat.
That's incredible! But what could possibly be the problem, besides Rome in August? I need your photographic memory and your passion for social upheaval to help me write the book about the Upper East Side.
My computer's gone.
It's Gosip Girl.
She took it.
After we got the address for tonight, I gave it to Gosip Girl.
I just need you to keep our agreement.
Take down Lily.
You can't hold me responsible for everything bad in your life.
I can because you are.
I want you gone for good.
Pack your things.
Serena, there is no "us" andand now that our parents are splitting up, I never have to see you again.
Do you have what I asked for? What did we bury in that coffin? Starting today, I will be the only Bass in Bass Industries.
All I've done is work to protect your legacy.
And pine after Blair Waldorf.
I'm gonna take over my mother's company, and it can be our future.
You said I always bet against you, but this time I'm all in.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gosip Girl.
Could it be any hotter? It's a good thing you're not fair-skinned.
Otherwise, your summer "Under the Tuscan Sun" would end up under a scalpel, removing a melanoma.
I know it was my idea, but why did I bring you to Italy? I should be at the workshop right now in Rome with all of the other writers, writing.
You shouldn't be creating in a workshop.
You're not an elf.
Besides, how can you possibly be inspired inside? But here, on the other hand, if you're really looking for payback, then what better place to knock the Upper East Side out of the dark ages than in the cradle of the renaissance itself? Da Vinci, Galileo, Humphrey Underwood? Oh, Dio mio.
Have you learned nothing? Technology means hackers.
We're going old school.
Don't just stand there.
Start typing.
Oh, grazie.
I'm parched.
You'll get yours when I get mine.
Real names this time.
No holding back.
Everyone gets exposed.
The naked truth.
Faster! Faster! Faster! Could this take any longer? I'm gonna ride this thing all night long.
I hate trains.
Excuse me.
Can you, like, move your leg? My God! Do that again.
What's the rush? We've got all the time in the world.
Welcome back, Upper East Siders.
Call me superstitious, but I've got a feeling this fall could be my last season.
Let's face it.
I've been at this a long time.
But age breeds wisdom, and this I know the best is yet to come.
You both look so relaxed.
Hamptons good for the soul, huh? Well, yes, the Hamptons were lovely, but nothing compares to the Seychelles, where Bart and I renewed our vows.
Which was restorative.
But our time with Eric off the African coast was the highlight.
Have you heard from Mr.
Chuck? Well, we're hoping Charles used his summer to relax as much as we have.
Well, I'm sure as soon as he sees what happy couple you are, happy family won't be far behind.
I'm not so sure.
Look at all this.
It'll take weeks to get through.
I thought Serena was keeping the apartment in order.
Well, that was the deal.
And since she's been ignoring my texts, our primary mode of communication, I assumed she was taking care of it.
Vanya? When is Serena gonna be back? Miss Serena? I haven't seen her all summer.
I really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me.
Yeah, well, it's nice to have someone else asking the questions for a change.
Plus Professor Peiser taught my favorite journalism class at Columbia.
Well, clearly it worked.
I mean, look how successful you are.
Well, we're about to find out.
I think it's really brave, you deciding to run "The Spectator" on your own.
No investors, no partners, no safety net.
Wait, are you here to freak me out or write a paper onon my paper? Sorry.
I'm just impressed.
I wouldn't be going it alone if I didn't think I could succeed.
And I have a story on the horizon I know is gonna secure the company's future.
You wouldn't happen to want to give Professor Peiser's class an exclusive? Uh, no.
But I like your initiative, and if we're still in business by the time you graduate maybe I'll interview you for a job.
Lily, hey.
How are you? Uh, Serena? No, I haven't heard from her all summer.
I assumed she was somewhere between Tulum and the Turks and Caicos.
Well, hey, hey, hey.
Don'tdon't worry about it.
Serena's disappeared on us before, but we always find her, and she's always fine.
Yes.
Okay.
I am well aware of the deadlines, mother.
You don't need to put any more pressure on me.
The stress is making my hair fall out in clumps.
Thank God for this chapeau.
If the Olsen twins can build a fashion empire bossing around pattern drafters, then so can I.
Oh, I have to go.
Someone I actually want to speak to just walked up.
A bientot, maman.
Bonjour, ma cherie.
Ca va, Jean Pierre? How was your meeting? Good.
Now that it's over, I can be here with you.
You Frenchmen.
Must be why I always come back to Paris.
Your mother again? I actually wish it was.
It's my friend Nate.
Someone we know is missing.
Oh.
What happened? Who can say? She does it all the time.
I'm sure it's nothing.
You don't sound convinced.
When was the last time you saw her? When I kicked her out of my apartment and told her my life would be better off without her in it.
It appears she got the message.
What are you going to do? Exactly what needs to be done set some more meetings with buyers, look at the latest sketches, contact the textile mill to see if they can move up production dates.
You don't have to take all this down.
You're not my assistant.
No.
But I do care about you, which is why I'm booking you a ticket back to New York.
That's where you need to be right now.
For your friend.
First class? Bulkhead by the window.
Merci.
De rien.
Did this really happen, you and Serena? On the bar of the Campbell apartment.
Every dirty detail exactly as it occurred.
Not that.
The part where you guys get it on is "Fifty Shades of Boring".
No offense.
After that, when you realized that she had a s*x tape.
She said she erased it, but did you actually see her do it? No.
I-I don't know.
I mean, she said she would.
I'm sure she did.
So she might still have it.
Are you going to answer that? No.
It's Blair again, and I know you might not believe this, but I'd rather listen to you than Blair and her excuses for dumping me.
Dan, finally! Thank you for picking up.
I know you've been dodging my calls all summer, but I talked to Nate, and no one knows where Serena is.
I thought you two might be together, hating me.
Are you with her? Hello, Blair.
Georgina.
I should've known it was you from the sound of that disdainful silence.
Now I don't even want to know why you are picking up n's phone, but please put him on so I can speak to him.
This is serious.
No one has seen Serena for months.
Not even Gosip Girl has posted about her.
And what could be worse than that? Always good catching up, Blair.
Ciao.
Wait! No! No! Okay, change of venue.
What? Why? What did Blair say? There's a new ending for your book, if we can find Serena before anyone else does.
I don't understand what we're doing here, Chuck.
Neither do I.
But I'm trying to find out.
This was the last project my father worked on before he How do I put this delicately? Faked died.
He said he was in Miami, but he was here in Dubai with you.
As his translator.
And I already told you everything I know.
Look, I pored over all the records when I took over Bass Industries, and there was nothing about a project in Dubai.
And I know a view this breathtaking would've taken up my father's time and interest.
Once again, Chuck, I wish I could help.
When your father walked away from this, I lost out, too.
I'm not sure what else I can do.
Maybe you can translate for me.
Do you speak unstable psychopath? Hello, Georgina.
To what do I owe the displeasure? From all around the world, our favorite Upper East Siders are asking the same question.
But I couldn't care less.
Serena Van Der Woodsen is dead.
At least to me.
Spotted at J.
F.
K.
and Teterboro our favorite U.
E.
S.
ers returning home.
What motivated this sudden flurry of transatlantic travel? Could it be a certain passport that didn't get stamped this summer? No, her passport's here.
It was in a box with her other things.
So let's focus our efforts closer to home.
Thank you, officer.
Charles.
You didn't have to come home But I am so glad you did.
Of course.
And you're not alone.
Amira Abbar.
Hello.
Amira's a new friend.
We met in Dubai.
Beautiful city.
With beautiful women.
I'm Bart Bass.
Son, I trust your summer was relaxing.
Indeed, father.
Nothing like travel to clear the mind.
I found Dubai fascinating.
Such a forward-looking city, yet so many links to the past.
It's true.
I showed Chuck all my favorite spots.
Usually, Chuck can find a woman's favorite spot all by himself.
Blair, you're back, and you brought a friend.
And who's your mystery guest? I was just introducing her.
Where were we? Just leaving.
Got a couple things to clear up at the office.
Yes, I'm gonna head out with you.
I have one more place to check for Serena.
Nice to meet you.
Amira, I'll meet you at the hotel.
Uh, yes.
You can drop her off on your way to my mother's.
I think there's jam on the steering wheel.
Consider yourself lucky if it's just jam.
I don't know how much time you've spent around babies Only yours, when you were pretending he was mine.
Constant pooping, food throwing, random explosions out of every orifice babies are nauseating.
Not that I don't love being a mother.
Just not as much as going on secret missions with me.
A woman shouldn't have to choose.
So wait, who who were you texting when Philip dropped the van off? 'Cause I think I was the last person to see Serena, and I have no clue where she is.
Yes, but you forget that I've known S.
since ninth grade.
And whenever she hits a road bump in life, inevitably she reaches for a bump of a different kind.
And her favorite provider is Damien Dalgaard.
You really think Serena's on drugs? Well, hopefully, or clinically insane.
Either would be a great ending for your book.
What? Poughkeepsie's known for three things.
I highly doubt that S.
is enrolled at Vassar, and she's certainly not signed for a taste testing at the Culinary Institute.
Which leaves? Where we're headed.
The Hudson River State Mental Hospital.
Swear to me that nothing is going on between you and Amira.
When I saw you two together, I thought you'd reneged on the promise we made.
Never.
She's a weapon against my father.
That's all.
They were involved in some off-the-record business deal.
I brought her back to rattle him.
Oh, she was his translator? Well, you've always expressed admiration for women who are good with tongues.
She's very pretty.
No prettier than your Jean Pierre.
As head of your Public Relations, does he know how much you enjoy relations in public? You two seem close.
Well, he's been my constant companion since I returned to Paris.
Focusing on work has made it easier to be away from you.
If I had known it would be this difficult going our separate ways, I would never have agreed.
Well, we had to come to some kind of an agreement or we never would've left that hotel room in Monte Carlo.
And We have much to do.
But like I said in the casino, I'm all in.
My bet's on us.
Lily.
What are you doing here? I thought you and Bart were circling the globe in an 80-foot yacht.
Well, the yacht was 110 feet, and most people who've actually been on one call it a boat.
I assume you didn't come all the way to Brooklyn to tell me that.
No.
I didn't come here to tell you anything.
I came here to ask.
Have you seen Serena? She's missing, and I thought she might've sought out Dan.
Well, Dan's in Italy, and I haven't seen or heard from Serena.
Oh, really? Is that why her sweater's here? Rufus, you have reached an all-time low.
I mean, first, you let her hide here and then you lie to me, right to my face.
That's not Serena's sweater.
It's mine.
What is going on here? Ivy's been staying here.
Here? With you? Lily, could I get you a glass of water? You don't look well.
I assure you I am quite all right.
Unlike you.
There's nothing wrong with Rufus.
He saved me.
After I tore up your check you wrote me, I had nothing.
I was on the verge of doing something desperate, and Rufus opened his home to me, gave me a second chance.
I don't know why it matters to you, but she's sleeping in Dan's room.
It doesn't matter to me.
None of it does.
My daughter is missing.
God knows what happened to her.
And I don't know why she would ever think of coming here.
This is all clothes and toiletries.
We're never gonna discover Serena's secrets in her loofah.
She never kept a day planner, maybe an address book that might have some names in it? Serena's life is on her cell phone, and it seems to be the only thing she has with her.
Still nothing from Gosip Girl? I checked.
Her last post on Serena was in the spring, the day she moved out.
Well, yeah, just because she hasn't written about Serena doesn't mean she doesn't know anything about her.
You do have a personal correspondence with our poison pen pal.
Yeah.
Well, when I heard from Lily, it was the first thing I tried.
Gosip Girl didn't give me anything.
Nate, you have to convince her.
Haven't you ever seen a Hitchcock movie or watched "Dateline"? There's only so many ways this goes kidnap/ransom, torture/murder, or brainwash/cult.
Okay, Blair, we get it.
No, you don't.
We both know that Serena is quite capable of hurting herself.
But This time, I'm afraid I hurt her, too.
There is one more thing I can try.
Anything, please.
If you have a card, now's the time to play it.
It's okay.
We'll find her.
Looks like N.
is about to save the day.
But we'll see if he can still save his friend.
And that way, we could take advantage of the natural light.
What do you think? Earth to Rufus.
Have you heard one thing I've said? Oh, yeah.
Sorry.
Um, "Earth to Rufus.
" That's a really cool name for a solo record, by the way.
Admit it.
Lily's visit upset you, not just because something could've happened to Serena, but because Lily would think there was something going on between us.
All you've done is been a good person.
What I've done is dragged you from one potential art gallery to another.
I mean, if you have to see one more polished concrete floor It was fun.
And it was worth it, finding this place.
Look, I'll call the agent, and I'll tell him you'll take it, and I'll go pick up the keys.
I can't let you do all that.
You can and you will, because you're gonna be too busy helping Lily.
Well, I guess I was Serena's dad longer than anyone else.
Which is why you should go.
Thanks, Ivy.
And, um If there are any problems with that realtor There won't be.
I've got this.
Trust me.
Hi.
You've reached Lola.
Leave a message.
Lola, hi.
It's Ivy.
So congrats on booking a TV series.
NBC, huh? It's very impressive.
Well, whatever acting you have going on over there has nothing on my performance.
Rufus Humphrey he's easy on the eyes and even easier to manipulate.
Call me.
All right, so we're not too far from where Gosip Girl said she is.
What makes you so sure we're not being led on a wild goose chase, Nathaniel? I mean, Gosip Girl is only slightly less trustworthy than, say, Georgina sparks or Me.
You know, you could at least pretend you're relieved that Serena wasn't institutionalized.
Any disappointment you're sensing is not because the mental hospital was a dead end.
It stems from the fact that you and I missed out on a real opportunity.
Empty hospital bed, soundproof rubber walls No, no, no, no, no.
You stop right there before I start chugging this premium unleaded.
I paid a serious price for Serena's location.
I was gonna break a major story.
I had surveillance video that could've led me to the identity of Gosip Girl.
Unmasking Gosip Girl? That's a major media coup.
I-I can't imagine a better way to relaunch "The Spectator.
" Yeah, well, you're gonna have to.
I traded the whole story to find out where Serena is.
I don't understand.
It's noble and selfless.
Of course you don't.
You put your whole venture at risk.
Hey, if it helps Serena, it's worth it.
Come on, Humphrey.
I can go undercover as a patient.
You could be my orderly.
Something about mental hospitals really just Gets me going.
Yeah, it's because you're insane.
I say we turn around right now to go home and pretend nod of this ever happened.
Start the car now, Dan.
We have to see what this odyssey can do in an open road.
And I'd say 40, 45 max.
Why? What's the sudden rush? That limo is Chuck's.
I memorized the license plate.
I knew he and Blair knew where Serena was.
Damien was right all along.
We have to get there before they do.
Serena recouping in rehab is much less interesting than a full-on slut spiral.
That's a heartwarming tale, but whywhy would you just assume that Chuck is with Blair anyway? No, hey! Georgina, wait a second.
Wait a second.
You gotta hold up.
What are you doing? Get in! Open thestop the car.
So the place we're going to doesn't look like it's on an actual road.
So she's literally off the map.
Well, whatever backwoods town we're headed to, it can't be good.
Serena is not country strong.
Yeah, well, we're gonna have to be for her.
Can you turn right here, please? We need to go west.
What the hell's going on?! What are we doing? Sabotage.
Georgina sparks.
With Humphrey in tow.
Hey, guys.
Nice day for a drive, huh? Don't talk to them.
Let's go.
Now.
W-where are you going and what are you doing with her? Probably the same thing you're doing with him.
Saving Serena? No.
Finding Serena.
And since you're going to be following us, I'm going to have you to follow my lead as well.
Which means what, exactly? Do nothing.
Whatever Serena is doing, we can't get involved.
We're there to observe and record, like a documentary.
This isn't a reality show, sparks.
This is reality, a concept I know you're a little fuzzy on.
So whatever filth-filled, paint-huffing meth den we find Serena cracked out in, we don't judge.
We're still her friends no matter what.
We're her family.
Oh, aren't you just the kindest, nicest little trust fund babies in the whole world? But when it comes to what Serena's capable of, I think you'll find it's nothing like what you imagined.
I can't argue with you there.
I would just like to point out that most serial killers are high-functioning members of society who lead a double life.
She could be trapped in the basement or buried in the backyard.
Good idea, Georgina.
Why don't you grab a shovel and start digging? There'sthere's gotta be an explanation for all this.
Can I help you? I believe you can.
We're looking for our friend Serena.
Blonde.
Legs for days.
Effortless charisma that only someone far less secure than I am would find threatening.
And I'm the weird one? I believe you mean Sabrina? I think someone's about to toss her cookies.
And the only thing more disturbing than finding her on drugs or in a psych ward is seeing her happy and healthy.
Who wants that? What the hell are you doing here? Uh, looking for you.
To observe and record.
No.
We're here to help you.
And get you home.
And, uh, I don't even know what I'm doing here.
Can't you see there's a party going on and you're not invited? Crashing parties is one of our favorite pastimes.
Especially when it involves infiltrating a sophisticated yet deadly cult.
Now which one is the charismatic leader? Please leave before it's too late.
Sabrina! Sabrina.
Too late.
Sabrina, you didn't tell me you invited friends.
That is so Sabrina.
Oh, she loves surprises.
She has so many surprises, you could write a book about 'em.
Where to end that book is the challenge.
I hope you don't mind us dropping by.
Steven.
Nice to meet you.
And of course not.
The more, the merrier on this special day.
Please, stay and be a part of it.
Oh, yes, Steven.
I think we will.
Why don't we get my friends some drinks then? Okay.
I know I'm not exactly a welcome houseguest these days, but we shouldn't let our recent history overshadow our past.
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
How could I have thought it was okay to go all summer without actually talking to my own daughter? Whatever this is, Lil, isn't your fault.
And why should I believe that? Because that's what you told me when Jenny ran away, and she was much younger and crazier, with much heavier eye makeup than Serena.
We raised good girls.
Unpredictable, sure.
Try reckless, defiant.
Spirited, independent.
Not unlike their parents at that age.
Oh, God.
Who can remember back that far? I can, and seeing the way her mom turned out, I have every confidence that Serena will be okay.
Well, look, I'm sorry about earlier.
I shouldn't have stormed out like that.
I had no right.
I should've known you wouldn't be attracted to someone like you know Ivy.
So sorry to interrupt, but, um, I just came from the gallery, and, uh, look.
We got it.
I was justI was so excited.
I couldn't wait! It's what we dreamed about all summer.
Well played, Rufus.
You butter me up, remind me how great you can be, only to have your little tramp show up here and throw whatever this is in my face.
Lily, hold on.
Is it any wonder our children are still so immature with such role models for parents? Don't say anything you're gonna regret.
I have no regrets, Rufus, only that I let you in my home today.
I'm already leaving.
You know, I know you're really worried about Serena, but you should try to relax your face.
You're getting some very pronounced frown lines.
Bye.
This is so much worse than we thought.
Because you're here? I agree.
What makes you say that? It's a nice house.
He seems like a nice guy.
Look at this.
Trellis, chairs, pastor.
This is a wedding.
And Serena was wearing a white dress! Either she's the bride, or she's just really tacky.
I told you.
She's obviously had a psychotic break.
Serena's taken too many happy pills, and now she think she's Sabrina from Dan's book.
That actually sounds vaguely plausible.
Or today's the day of the cult sacrifice, and since I don't see any volcanoes in the area, I wonder if they're burning her at the stake.
And then you lost me.
Whatever is going on, we can't let her marry this guy.
Time for a plan.
Okay, well, Lily was really worried this morning, so I should at least call her and let her know we found Serena.
And I can reach out to the Ostroff Center, have them ready Serena's old bed just in case.
And Humphrey and I will try to get her alone.
We're the closest to her, the best chance of breaking through.
Aren't you forgetting someone? Trying to.
Fear not.
I've seduced a man of the cloth before.
I can do it again.
This wedding cannot happen.
Blair, why don't you go find Serena on your own? You know, I'm really not up for a super secret mission, especially with you.
I'm not even here to help.
Georgina just dragged me along so I could, you know, oh.
Okay.
What is wrong with you? Uh, aside from the fact that my face now hurts? You know what, Blair? You chose Chuck.
I don't owe you an explanation.
Good luck.
In here, Chuck.
Wrong Bass, my dear.
What are you doing here? I came here to ask you the same question.
So is Chuck using you, or are you using him? What goes on between Chuck and me is none of your business.
You better hope your relationship has nothing to do with business, because so help me, if you've told him anything about mine.
I haven't.
Yet.
But that could always change.
Chuck is very persuasive.
Takes after his father in more ways than one.
What do you want to leave town with your mouth shut? You think you can just buy my silence? I can buy anything.
It's one of the chief perks of being really rich.
$10 million.
Everything okay? You seem a little nervous.
Oh.
Yeah, no.
It's just a lot of pressure, and I want everything to be perfect.
So But when do I get to see you alone? That's all I care about.
Not soon enough.
Although, I, uh, imagine you wanna spend some time with your friends.
So are they from Vassar or did you, uh, grow up with them in Wisconsin? Uh, Wisconsin.
And I'mI'm so sorry I didn't tell you that I invited them.
It just must've slipped my mind with all this going on.
No, it's okay.
It's okay.
I'll see you out there.
Okay.
Wisconsin? Seriously? Do you even know where that is on a map? What I do know is, you told me you never wanna see me again, and then you show up here, today of all days, when I'm finally happy with someone I actually care about? Cares about you or Sabrina from Madison who goes to Vassar? Georgina's right.
You really are delusional.
I'm not gonna let you ruin this.
Serena, I have no intention of ruining your big day.
I hope you do marry this guy.
Frankly, it would be the kind of desperate, attention-seeking stunt that would prove you're every bit as shallow and sad as the character in my book, so Okay, I deserved that one.
Wait.
Wait, marry him? How'd it go? Humphrey and I split up.
I didn't find Serena, so hopefully he did.
You? The Ostroff Center's on alert, though apparently now it's called the Pedowitz Institute.
Great news.
You'll never guess what I found.
Looks like Nate Archibald to me.
After I talked to Lily, I found her rooting around Serena's bathroom.
Not rooting.
Snooping.
And all for a good reason.
The only thing you were supposed to be doing was getting between that man and his cloth.
He's protestant.
I do my best work with Catholics.
Thank God I'm an atheist.
Great.
Now this wedding is gonna happen unless we find Serena, which requires us finding Dan.
Well, that might be easier than you think.
Could I have everyone's attention, please? Sabrina, would you would you join me? Tell them, please.
Of course.
Okay, so Serena explained everything Explained what? That's she's never been happy in her whole life and she found true love for the very first time? Please.
in life, which is why I'mI'm so glad that you all could be here for this special moment.
And to have the love of my life by my side.
So let's, uh, let's all raise a glass No! No! We will raise nothing! You cannot marry her.
You don't even know her! Blair, please.
Her name isn't Sabrina either.
It is Serena.
Serena Van Der Woodsen! And that's not all.
What are you doing? I've got this.
Public humiliation's really more my forte.
Sabrina/Serena has a history of mental imbalance, drug use, and promiscuity.
That's right.
She's got a rap sheet and a snuff film.
Yeah, and we have contacted a psychiatric care center who has agreed to take her into custody.
Kill me now.
Hey! What are you doing down there?! Wait.
Who are the two angry guys in matching hats? They're the grooms.
That's what I was trying to say.
This is not Serena's wedding.
Will someone tell me what's going on here? Why are the maid of honor's friends ruining David and David's wedding? I know I have some explaining to do.
But can we talk, just the two of us, please? No.
No one goes anywhere.
No more lies.
I have proof that you're on drugs.
I found these in your bathroom.
Yeah, those are vitamins.
Okay.
Like we're supposed to believe that.
Steven makes them.
He has a holistic health company.
Wait.
You're Steven Spence.
I saw you speak at the T.
E.
D.
conference last year.
I told you I was fine.
Actually, no, you didn't.
Yeah.
Dan is right.
You fell off the face of the earth without a word.
But isn't that what you wanted? You kicked me out of your house.
You said you have no reason to ever speak to me again.
And, what, you two were too busy doing whatever it is you do to even send a text? I spent the summer in the middle east, dealing with something relating to my father.
It's serious.
Well, and so am I about turning my life around.
Wait a second.
Blair, you two spent the summer apart? I started my summer on a train, being revived by paramedics.
Mouth-to-mouth on public transportation? Yeah, I'd say that's rock bottom.
Yeah, I would, too, which is why I wanted to start fresh without any of you.
As for why I pretended to be someone else, well, I-I think that explains itself.
Serena! I don't believe you.
Well, I'm not gonna let her just charge off without No, not Serena.
You.
That you chose Chuck, I don't like it, but I begrudgingly accept it.
Dan, please don't do this.
But then I find out that you're not even with him.
I am with him, or at least I will be.
We made a pact.
We have things we need to do on our own.
But when we are both in that next place, we will be together for food.
End of story.
So I didn't lose you to Chuck.
I lost you to the idea of Chuck, at some point in the hopefully not-to-distant future, maybe? Well, when you put it that way You know, you had someone who loved you unconditionally, treated you right, and wanted to be with you every day, and then you threw that all away to let Chuck Bass decide when he's ready for you? You think you two have an epic love, but all you have are excuses.
I have to go find Serena.
I'm sorry I came to Lily's.
I never meant to cause any problems.
Lily thinks what she wants.
It's always the worst, especially about me.
Well, she's wrong.
I probably shouldn't be saying this, but I'm glad you got away from her.
She doesn't appreciate you.
Never did.
You know, if you have such a poor opinion of Lily, then Why was it so important for you to get close to her? I realize now she's not the one I wanna be close to.
You're the good one, and you care about other people.
And I think that's why she's so threatened by me.
I see the real you, and I don't think she deserves you.
That's an interesting theory.
I think it's more than that.
Ivy It's okay.
I'm not a kid.
You're not married.
Why are you still here? You didn't think I was leaving without you? Or without saying I'm sorry.
Because I am, Serena.
Thinking that I really lost you made me regret every horrible thing I've ever said to you.
Well, that's a lot of regret.
However complicated our friendship got, I shouldn't have let it go.
I shouldn't have let you go.
"B.
F.
F.
" means "best friend forever," right? Well, maybe it's time to admit that We're stuck with each other.
I appreciate the kind words, andand I know that they're hard coming from you, but I don't want to be stuck with you.
I want a fresh start with Steven.
Fine.
If that's how you want it, stay here.
You can have Poughkeepsie.
Hell, you can even have Schenectady, but I get Manhattan.
Have a nice life.
Poor B.
Looks like she just got dumped by the love of her life, and we're not talking about Chuck or Dan.
The two of us alone in your limo? You're really tempting fate.
You know that? Unless that's your intention, of course.
We're both back in New York, doing what we need to do.
Maybe our pact is just an excuse for us not to be together.
Blair, I love you with all my heart, and that is the reason we cannot take the chance of messing this up.
Sure.
Because what would your father think if you failed? That I distracted you.
That you sacrificed your empire for me.
Blair, you are a distraction, because when we're together you're all I think about.
And I would give up my empire for you.
I would give up everything for you.
After a couple nights in Monte Carlo, I lost track of all time.
We were exhausted and starving.
I think I had an actual fever.
But that's not why we need to do this, and neither to prove a point to my father.
Then what? In the past, I blamed my mistakes on you, and Bart was right on that count.
It's the boy who blames the girl, not the man, and that's what I want to be with you.
It won't be much longer, I promise.
Arthur, pull over.
Wait.
What are you doing? This is your limo.
I need to walk it off.
Hey, sage.
Hi.
Sorry for dropping in after hours, but I was walking by and I saw that your office light was on.
Ah.
No, you, uh, you justyou thought of more questions, huh? Only one.
Would you like to have a drink with me? Yeah.
I could use a drink, actually.
Bad news on your big story? Real bad.
What's old is new again.
I may not have much time left, but some things are forever.
Since you know who I am, I thought it was time that you see where I'm from.
That explains why you didn't want to come back to the city and stay at my place.
I'm just on the other side of the park.
You know, all that time away, I didn't realize how much I missed it.
But now that I'm back and I'm with you, New York has never seemed more perfect.
The promise of love No one can ruin this, no matter how hard they're gonna try.
The threat of war And the fall of the mighty.
Amira.
It's late.
I thought you would be in your own suite.
Your father gave it to me to keep quiet.
About what? For that amount of money, you must know a hell of a secret.
I swear I don't know what it is, but I wanted to stick around to find out.
That was a waste of time.
All that driving and wedding crashing and public humiliation, and still no Serena.
What's worse, still no ending to your book.
Serena still has her cell phone.
I just know that video has to be on it.
I guess we'll never know 'cause Serena's not coming back, and you're not going looking for her again.
Something to hide, Humphrey? If memory serves, that video should make you a star.
Or is it that you just don't want Blair to see? Can youcan you, can you just drop it, please? Why are you even walking me to my door? I'm not kissing you good night.
Okay.
I' call you tomorrow.
And just because I've seen it all doesn't mean I've seen everything.
And I gotta say, no one saw this one coming.
You may think my best days are behind me, but this old girl still has some new tricks.
Stay tuned.

, Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here, your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I need your passion for social upheaval to help me write the book about the Upper East Side.
Don't just stand there.
Start typing.
Real names this time, no holding back.
Everyone gets exposed.
I have decided to retire.
That's why I want you to take over my company.
I didn't realize how much I missed it, but now that I'm back and I'm with you, New York has never seemed more perfect.
I think it's really brave, you deciding to run "The Spectator" on your own.
No investors, no partners.
Wait.
Are you here to freak me out or write a paper on on my paper? You father gave it to me to keep quiet.
For that amount of money, you must know a hell of a secret.
I swear I don't know what it is, but I'm willing to stick around to find out.
Sorry for dropping in after hours, but I was walking by, and I saw that your office light was on.
Would you like to have a drink with me? And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

Up and at 'em, upper east siders.
It's important to start your day right.
Seems like you were already up.
Yeah.
Thanks to you, I've been up all week.
Five more minutes.
Mm.
We might need a little longer.
There's nothing worse than waking up on the wrong side of the bed I thought we agreed you'd stop watching me sleep.
I lied.
I'm letting you stay here for free.
There has to be something in it for me.
Except maybe waking up alone.
Dorota! Why did you let me sleep?! It's "W.
W.
D.
" Day! We have to take the fashion world by storm.
First, it's breakfast, then shower, then to the atelier.
I can hardly wait to see what today brings.
I'm booked on the 7:00 flight to Dubai.
Please, just a little more time.
We've spent all week pouring over the notes of every meeting I interpreted for Bart.
There's nothing, Chuck.
Look, I know the reason my father faked his death has something to do with this hotel deal.
It has to be here.
We looked.
It's not.
Then why would he lie about being in Dubai? Why would all the negotiations happen completely off the books? Why would he pay you $10 million not to ask any of these questions? If he's hiding something, I don't know what.
I'm sorry.
I need to get home to my fianc.
There's nothing more I can do.
You could come to brunch.
With Bart? That sounds dangerous.
You won't have to say a word.
Just smile while I drop a few names to see how he reacts.
Then you can take your money and go.
You know, I was a very punctual person before I met you.
Well, any way I can convince you to be fashionably late to my gala tonight? I know you have the Crowdrise event, but maybe after? Nah, I'd love to, but this thing's been booked for months, and who knows how long it'll go? I don't want to say "maybe" and then disappoint you.
How could you disappoint me when you did so much work to get me on the board in the first place? I know what a big deal the Central Park Conservancy is.
When my mom was finally asked to host, she made it seem like it was more important than being the mayor.
Well, now that you're hosting, it definitely is.
Tonight marks the start of a whole new era.
Serena takes Manhattan.
Ohh.
An adult Manhattan.
I couldn't be happier to leave my old life behind.
Well, just don't leave me, even if I can't make it tonight.
Mmm.
The renovation is complete.
Fabric is all from swatches you choose.
Your mother's vintage designs on display.
And this area can be showroom or waiting room, parties or meetings.
Form follows function.
And in here Miss Blair's private office.
This is divine.
This is so me.
Oh! This "Women's Wear Daily" article could make or break me as the new head of Waldorf.
And the atelier is the perfect backdrop.
All these years of folding my sweaters and fluffing my pillows has really paid off.
You've developed taste! Yes.
Oh.
Miss Blair's new samples looks lovely.
And I glad office is up to snuff.
But I I worry if "W.
W.
D.
" will ask, "where are the designers, seamstresses, and models?" It is unfortunate that my mother's Paris team declined to follow me back to New York, but not to worry.
While you were paint and papering, I came up with a plan.
Hello, ladies! Get ready to assume your roles.
Go get dressed for success.
Your sofa might be chic, but my neck is not happy with this kink.
Would you prefer the kink of watching your father do it with fake Charlie again? No, I did not watch.
I got the hell out before they saw me.
The image is still burnt right here.
To think that I used to consider Brooklyn a moral high ground.
Now that my father's fallen off his pedestal, I'm free of such delusions.
Your loss of faith in humanity turns me on, as does the fact that your book was rejected by Simon & Shuster and you were dropped by your agent.
I still don't get why they didn't want it.
They sent me to Italy to write "Inside Part Two," and this time I delivered a real story with real names.
Raw, hard facts.
Please say "raw" and "hard" again.
Who cares about Alessandra and the entire lit set? They're just book nerds.
Revenge is a dish best served serialized, one delicious chapter at a time.
Once we find the right magazine, and everyone starts talking, then the book offers will come in.
Then the movie, and then the Broadway musical.
Check your calendar.
We have meetings all afternoon.
Yeah, well, I got an errand to run.
I'll see ya at "Vanity Fair.
" Can't wait to start burning bridges together.
Well, thank you for accepting our invitation for brunch, Charles.
You know how important it is to me that we make an effort as a family.
Of course.
And I do want you both to get to know Amira.
Did I mention she speaks seven languages, including body? Numerous times.
Micro-expressions, vocal shifts.
We get it.
She's "The Mentalist" Eat a crpe.
So how did you two get together? It's a tale as old as time.
Boy meets girl, girl falls for boy and shares her deepest and darkest secrets.
Chuck exaggerates.
Um, we both found ourselves admiring the fish-tank at Ossiano.
A classic meet-cute and quite ordinary, I'm afraid.
Amira was attending a business dinner with Khalid Al-Saleh.
You must know him, father.
He's big in middle east real estate.
He's developed a few hotels.
Doesn't ring a bell.
Really? Because Amira says he knew you.
I doubt very much that Amira discusses her work with you.
She seems like an intelligent woman who understands that her livelihood, if not her life itself, depends on her discretion.
If you'll excuse me, I should confirm my flight for tonight.
You certainly scared her off.
Yeah, I think I'm done also.
I have a meeting with Bruce Kaplan to find out if Bass Industries is finally bouncing back after your reign.
Charles, I know you're upset that your father took his company back, but give him a chance.
He did risk his life to save yours.
And he's not the man he used to be.

  Yes, 7
0.
That's right.
Perfect.
Thank you.
What the hell do you think you're doing? I paid you a lot of money to leave the country.
I'm sorry.
Chuck insisted that I come here today.
Well, I insist you go.
Our weekend together has cost me enough.
Don't make me warn you again.
Chuck, I think it's time to go.
What am I supposed to be? I'm torn between nurse and cafeteria worker.
You are a seamstress, whom I will publicly shame with my artistic temperament.
And, Kati, you are a crazed fan, begging to borrow a limited edition.
Dorota! When the reporter arrives, you will wheel out the dresses with a grand flourish.
Reaction to clothes is what really counts.
If article is negative, could poison perception of whole line and jeopardize future of Waldorf Designs.
Kati, start your adulation right now.
O.
M.
G.
Nelly Yuki.
Great! Maybe she knows how to sew.
She lost her status as a minion when she stole my spot at Yale.
She knows better than to beg for reinstatement.
Hi, Blair.
"Hi"? No "hi.
" Go! Before the "Women's Wear Daily" reporter shows up and thinks that I consort with fake Dior-carrying wannabes.
Actually, this bag was a personal gift from Raf after I wrote an article on him.
After you Uh-huh.
That's right, Blair.
I'm the "Women's Wear Daily" reporter.
Thanks for picking up my check in person.
It means a lot for "The Spectator" to sponsor the same event as "The Times".
Well, I'm glad you wanna be involved.
Just do me a favor and please don't invite Blair.
Have you even told her that you're back yet? This is a long time for you to be mad at Blair just for being Blair.
I'm not mad.
I'm maturing.
We're just naturally growing apart.
You know, being with Steven has really helped me to understand who I wanna be.
I hope you find someone like that, too.
You never know.
I might have.
What?! Wait.
Who?! I met a girl.
Her name's Sage.
She's a Columbia journalism student.
She's funny.
She's smart.
I just but it's all very new, so I I can't talk about it.
Whoa! Shy smile, reluctant eye contact? I think I've seen enough.
You really like her.
Keep the change.
You're gonna love this place.
What, you can't even look at me? No, no, no.
I'm not not looking at you.
I'm looking at her with your boyfriend.
It really is so good to see you.
You said that already.
Twice.
Blair, please.
Please let me wear one of your exclusive designs.
You're supposed to be the seamstress.
Oh.
Go help Dorota make tea, both of you.
Welcome back, Nelly! I see nothing's changed around here since high school.
Except you.
You look so presentable.
Yes.
Once I got into Yale, I realized I didn't have to dress like you anymore.
So let's see your line.
It's not here.
Shipping snafu en route from Paris.
You're lying.
If I were, it would only be to protect Waldorf Designs from your biased opinion of me, which is based on nothing but good, clean high school fun.
I still have night terrors about nairtinis and yogurt bombs.
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night shouting, "tights are not pants!" But I am not biased.
I play fair.
That's why I got into Yale, and you didn't.
Oh.
Did I mention I graduated early? Send another reporter.
It's my story.
And look on the bright side.
No matter what I write, readers can see the pictures of your collection next to Poppy Lifton's and decide for themselves.
Poppy? That Ponzi-scheming fauxcialite? The only designing she is doing is with popsicle sticks in the arts and crafts room of a women's prison.
She's a thief.
Blair, that was so four years ago.
My article is called "Society goes sartorial," and it profiles two designers, you and her.
We're not photographing anything until tomorrow, so you have until then to decide if you wanna be included.
Stop eavesdropping and get in here! I need recon on Poppy Lifton's collection now.
Hey, it's me.
Leave a message.
Hey, Sage, it's Nate.
Listen, I've had a lot of fun this week.
Buy you know what? I'm done.
Have a nice life.
Why did you just do that? It's too crazy of a coincidence that your Sage and my Steven are seeing each other.
Well, we could have completely the wrong idea.
I doubt it.
I've had way too many girls talk me back into relationships I wanted out of.
Just like you run away from too many guys you didn't want to confront with the truth.
I mean, maybe it's time we start doing things a little bit differently.
You're right.
We've just made terrible relationship choices.
Or as Patti Stanger would say, our pickers are broken.
Are you really quoting the millionaire matchmaker? As if you don't watch it.
Ah.
It's true.
If I really wanna be mature, I should just calmly ask Steven to explain.
On the phone.
Good luck with that.
All right, I've gotta get back to the office.
But, uh, I'll see you tonight.
Sorry.
I'll have to call you back.
Did you have an affair with Amira? I spent a weekend with her.
Years ago, after I suspected you had been with Rufus.
But I apologize.
That's no excuse.
No.
However, it explains why she's extorting money from you.
You overheard us talking.
It seemed a small price to ensure that my old behavior didn't get in the way of our new relationship.
Well, thank you.
I appreciate your honesty.
Um, I can't imagine how Charles will feel when he finds out about his girlfriend's agenda.
I suspect that's why he's brought her here.
One second.
Serena.
Hi.
Hi.
I didn't expect to hear from you today.
How is the party planning? Uh, good, I think.
Is everything okay? Uh, are you seeing someone else? Um, it's it's okay if you are, because, you know, we never really defined things over the summer.
Well, we didn't have to define things.
We moved in together.
I know, but, you know, that was in the country.
And, you know, maybe you have something going on here that's a little complicated.
I mean, I would understand if you do, but but just please tell me the truth.
I'm not seeing anyone else.
But I have to get back to my meeting, so I'll call you later.
Nate.
Thanks for calling, man.
Serena's intervention wasn't exactly conducive to catching up.
True, but I know what you were up to this summer.
Well, are you referring to my acquired taste for a tuscan red or or Georgina cracking the whip? You didn't really let her, did you? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
It was a figure of speech.
No, I meant she was being a slave driver about my new book.
That's actually what I wanna talk to you about.
I wanna publish it in "The Spectator.
" You do you know what it's about? Serialized character studies of people on the Upper East Side.
Yeah, using real names.
I get it, all right, but I really need it after I gave up my "Who is Gossip Girl?" expos.
I don't know.
Mixing business and friendship didn't work so well with the film rights to "Inside.
" All right, first of all, that was Serena.
This is me.
Second, "The Spectator" has an entire print arm now.
I can publish it on multiple platforms.
This could be a defining moment for us.
Look, Nate, I'm flattered, but I'm letting Georgina handle the business side.
So if you if you really want in, you're gonna have to call her.
All right.
Why do you look like the "before" pictures of people who need Botox? You can't be worried that Poppy's collection is better than mine.
Actually, it's pretty much the same.
W what do you mean "the same"? Like, the same quality? The same style? The same, Blair.
She's using that exact fabric.
Nelly! She set me up! Ugh! If I'm in her article, she will write that I copied Poppy.
But then if I'm not, she will showcase Poppy's collection alone, and then everyone will assume that I am the plagiarist! You're screwed! Sorry.
Nelly got into Yale by playing clean, but no one does dirty better than Blair Waldorf.
Those dresses will never be photographed.
Hello, Lily.
Charles, your father told me what you did this morning, and I'm not pleased about it.
Are you referring to the fact I didn't finish my eggs or that I forgot to say good-bye when I left? You brought Amira to our home to extort money from Bart and to wreak havoc on our relationship.
I don't know what my father's told you, but let me assure you, Amira's presence has nothing to do with you.
Well, since they slept together, it has everything to do with me.
I'm sorry, Lily.
I had no idea.
I have to go.
Wait.
When were you planning to tell me you had an affair with my father? Poor Chuck.
Everyone knows the first place to check for secrets is under the bed.
Or in it.
It's terrific, exactly what "The Nation" likes literate but a little licentious.
It will rock the Upper East Side and make waves way beyond New York.
Genius.
It'll be like when people first read Dominick.
I told you.
He's the second coming.
And third and fourth if he lets you stay the night.
Of course, we'll have to fact-check it.
That could take a while.
Ben's really good friends with the Basses, so there would have to be some cuts, and I'm not talking about their time in tennis camp.
But we just can't open ourselves to a Biro-sized legal suit.
Maybe lose the last names? What is the point of publishing an expos if you're not going to expose everything? Who cares? They're willing to pay for the version that works for them.
It'll get us both out of Brooklyn.
No, but then I'm compromising my integrity again.
What happened to telling the truth about these people? Save your passion for your poetry, which you can write as much as you want once this makes you rich and famous.
Well, I I did the soft pedal with "Inside," and my life stayed remarkably the same.
Why is the handsome, vacant one calling me? If you're referring to Nate, he has a surprisingly high I.
Q.
But he he wants the book for "The Spectator.
" Okay, no.
We're playing with the big boys on this one.
So stop moping and go find yourself a suit you can wear to a bidding war.
You sneak up the fire escape here and smash Poppy's showroom window.
Why can't Kati's ex-boyfriend who showed us Poppy's samples just let us in? So it looks like a random robbery, not a socialite stealing samples.
Wear those.
That's my ex.
We have a problem.
He told you he's gay, just like everyone else you slept with.
Discuss it with your therapist.
No, Blair.
He says Poppy has decided to have "W.
W.
D.
" photograph her collection at the Central Park Conservancy gala.
Damn it! That is the perfect backdrop! Not to mention, the clothes will be seen by all the right women.
We need to get there first and intercept.
That might be harder than you think.
Why? I can get an invitation to anything.
Serena's the hostess.
Serena's back? I didn't know.
I mean of course I knew.
It's just, the Central Park Conservancy is It's the big leagues, yeah.
Well, Serena's new boyfriend got her on the board.
Well good for Serena.
Just so happens that I know someone else who can help us.
Bart and I were only together for one weekend.
I didn't mention it because you were investigating his business, not his personal life.
I was looking for his secrets.
You count.
But then perhaps he simply paid to hide our affair from your stepmother.
My father would never spend that kind of money on a relationship.
There must be something else connected to that weekend.
I can't imagine what, and I can't risk staying to find out.
Then you leave without your money.
Chuck, don't do this.
That money belongs to me and my family.
And it's in my safe, and I won't open it until you tell me everything that happened that weekend.
It's nothing.
Use your memory.
Use your e-mails.
Use your credit card bills.
I wanna know every person you saw, every place you went.
The sooner you write it all down, the sooner you can leave.
Now I have to go and help a friend, but I will be back.
Serena.
You must be excited about your big night.
Where's Steven? I'm dying to meet him.
Oh, well, he's not coming, which is good, since I just found out he's cheating on me.
Oh, I'm so sorry, darling.
It's Steven.
He just canceled his meeting so that he can come tonight.
How how am I supposed to face him? With a smile.
Tonight is your entree into adult society.
You can't let him jeopardize that.
So I'm just supposed to stand there and act like I don't know he was with someone else? Well, that's the difference between being a grownup and in high school.
Now you'd better go get dressed.
It's bad form for a hostess to be late to her own gala.
I just hope there are no more surprises.
Hello.
Finally.
I've been trying you all afternoon.
I know.
I didn't answer.
I thought the message was pretty clear.
Wow, I didn't have you figured for the voice mail breakup douche.
What changed since I left your bed this morning? Uh, I found out you lied.
I didn't lie exactly.
You know what? I'm coming over right now to explain.
No way.
I've been manipulated by that sentence before.
Listen, I'm busy at "The Spectator" and I'm already late for the Conservancy gala.
Forget the jeans.
I need a dress for tonight.
Looks like someone's getting dressed to kill or at least for a hell of a fight.
Hi.
Good to see you.
Hey.
Ah! Oskar, hello! How are you? Good, thanks.
Do you want to take a picture? Sure.
I loved your production of "As You Like It.
" Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Hope to see you down at The Public soon.
Me, too.
Take care.
You look beautiful.
Oh.
You made it.
I know how much it meant to you.
Yeah.
It did.
Georgina, what are we doing here? We weren't even invited.
Did not having a formal invite ever stop Norman mailer from showing up? The most powerful publishers in the world are opening their pockets for philanthropy.
We just have to take advantage.
Yeah, except they don't want my material unless I cut and paste and make everyone look pretty.
Once I get you your first big deal, then you can go all Hunter S.
Thompson on me.
Stop whining and start working the room.
I have to go find Graydon and tell him he has competition for my protg's expos.
You two are adorable.
The Tisches have some new competition for the cutest charitable couple.
Nah, this one's all Serena.
We'd love you to introduce her as our newest board member.
Then Serena can present the check to the park.
Sounds great.
Hey, I wanted to ask you, are you still seeing If you'll excuse me So "The Spectator" is exploring all kinds of new demographics.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I need to speak with Nate.
Thanks.
What are you doing? That was the head of media for Johnson & Johnson.
I thought you broke up with Sage.
Yeah, I did, which is more than you can say about Steven.
How can you make out with a guy knowing he cheated on you? Okay.
I let him kiss me on the cheek, but I'm not gonna break up with him or cause a scene until after this party's over, which became a lot more complicated when Sage arrived.
What don't girls understand about "it was fun.
I'm done"? Please just get rid of her.
Please tell me there's a carriage somewhere trotting away with Poppy's posse.
They're on their way to the duck pond for their photo shoot.
Even though it's not really there.
Models are so dumb.
You should've seen them crowded in that carriage like four scrawny sardines.
Who needs Serena Van Der Woodsen when you are friends with Andre the handsome the cab driver? Wait.
Four? "Women's Wear Daily" needed to photograph six dresses.
That means two are still on the loose.
Oops.
It only takes one photograph to eclipse my line forever.
I will go distract Nelly Yuki.
You search and destroy anyone with a dandelion motif.
Hurry! Shoo! Back to the party! Blair, are you okay? Well, not yet.
I still have two dresses I need to round up.
I didn't know that you were coming to Serena's party.
I wasn't intending to, but then I heard from you.
From me? Well, you must've telepathically sensed my distress for my dresses.
No, this was a text.
Wait.
If you didn't send it, I think I know who did.
I have to go.
Hurry.
The sooner you go, the sooner you can come back.
In the grander sense.
You just gonna ignore me? Look, I told you I have nothing to say to you except good-bye.
I swear I didn't lie.
I just omitted certain details.
And only because I liked you and I knew it wouldn't change anything between us.
Then I guess you're more liberal than I am because it definitely changes things for me.
But it doesn't have to.
You could pretend you don't know.
I don't think I can do that.
You could at least try.
I had higher hopes for you, Humphrey.
Sorry.
What? How can the smartest boy at St.
Jude's still want everything he can't have? No, I I don't want her.
I was just, uh I was just observing.
You know, that's what writers do.
I didn't mean Blair.
I mean in.
Your whole Gatsby-ish obsession.
Fitzgerald seemed to make a good career out of it.
If you wanna die a miserable drunk trying to impress people who don't know you exist.
There is that fatal flaw.
I got over mine when I went to Yale and met a bunch of other smart losers.
Nelly, you're not a loser.
Yes, I am, and so are you.
They'll never let us in.
The sooner you accept it, the sooner you can stop trying and start competing.
That's kind of tough when they already have everything.
We have the truth.
That's how the losers win.
We stop playing by their rules and make our own.
Nelly, don't you look ethereal in this garden of earthly delights.
That's my cue.
It was nice talking to you, Nelly.
Dan, there you are.
Graydon wants to make us an offer.
We're going to Cipriani's to discuss.
This better be good.
I just want to apologize.
We got off on the wrong foot this morning.
I wanna hear every detail of your life since constance.
Amira? I'm afraid you missed her.
I'd say you could call, but she's probably enjoying a fine Merlot at 30,000 feet above the ground by now.
No.
She wouldn't leave without her money.
It's sweet, really, that you also use your mother's birthday as your combination.
You make it all so easy.
Drink? Blair, what are you doing here? Well, I would've R.
S.
V.
P.
'd if I got my invitation.
Or the call to tell me that you'd returned to the city.
Kind of reminds me of the time that you came back from boarding school without a word.
I'm not trying to hurt you.
I'm just trying to move on, and so should you.
Well, as the hostess of such an elegant event, you wouldn't want to cause a scene.
Would you? Nothing is more pressing to me than making sure this evening goes perfectly, which I'm sure you have some sort of scheme to destroy.
So please leave before I have security escort you out.
If you weren't invited, Blair, then why are you here? Blair! Blair! Okay! I got the last one, and I left the model standing in nothing but her La Perlas.
Or maybe they were Kiki.
I don't I'm not sure.
Is that one of your Waldorf Designs? No, it's one of mine, and all the models who are supposed to be wearing them are missing.
What's going on, Blair? Sage? What is this? Why do you care? I didn't come here with you.
Well, you're leaving with me now.
I don't think so.
I didn't ask.
Take your hands off her.
She said "no.
" Stay out of this.
No, I won't.
You're the one who's supposed to be in a relationship with Serena.
Wait.
This is your girlfriend? Well, this is my boyfriend.
Steven, what are you doing?! You know how important tonight is to me, and now you're humiliating me to defend that slut? That "slut" happens to be my 17-year-old daughter.
Spotted Nate Archibald with a minor problem that just became a major incident.
Why didn't you tell me you have a daughter? Obviously because she's the same age as you are.
Now Serena is an adult, and she's not missing her curfew and she's not in high school.
Yeah, and I'm not gonna let this drag me back into it.
I have a check to present.
Say good night.
I'll be back to take you home.
You're in high school? Isn't that why you broke up with me? I broke up with you because I thought you were sleeping with your father before I knew he was your father.
That's disgusting.
Yeah! I'm not sleeping with anyone but you.
And it's legal.
I checked.
So can we please just go back to your place and do that? No! You're 17, and I'm pretty sure you're grounded.
I really did audit Professor Peiser's class this summer.
And we're closer in age than my dad and Serena.
Or you and Diana Payne.
Yeah.
I got an "A" on my paper about "The Spectator.
" Serena, I know you're upset.
We spent months together, and you never mentioned you had a child, never mind one who's old enough to share my clothes.
Come on.
It took you all summer to tell me your real name.
Look, we both needed time before we were ready to share everything.
Even Shakespeare said, "what's in a name?" Unlike a daughter, who's a huge piece of your life.
Yeah, and when women find out about her, they either bolt or pressure me to meet her.
And honestly, I I've never been ready to introduce her to anyone until you.
You know, I always imagined your first meeting as more of a breakfast or coffee-type thing.
Really? It wasn't punching out her boyfriend? And the more serious we get, the more we're gonna have to trust each other.
Do you think you can do that? I really wanna try.
Business records, blueprints.
You need to stop this childish nonsense.
You're the one who faked a text from Blair.
Classic high school move.
How about we call a truce? It would make Lily happy.
She's very upset that you're trying to destroy our marriage.
I don't care about your marriage, and neither do you.
Of course I do.
Why else would I have paid Amira all that money to leave town? To protect whatever secret really forced you to fake your death, something that's obviously not in these files.
I already told you.
I did it to keep you and Lily safe.
And I wanted to believe it.
I wanted to believe you cared about me, that I had finally earned my father's love.
Then let me give you some bass properties, and we'll call ourselves a family again.
Oh, no, no, no.
It's too late for that.
You took everything from me, again and again.
Now I'm going to find your secret and I'm going to take everything from you.
Maybe it's not too late to find Blair and help her with those errands.
Why are you torturing me? Blair knew your dresses would look better than hers in print.
No.
I knew that the two of you were working together to destroy me in "W.
W.
D.
" We met for the first time today, Blair, when I interviewed her.
I don't believe you.
And you and your fake African satellite-selling brain did not find my fabric on its own.
Plus I have done terrible things to the two of you in the past, so you must've wanted revenge.
I did, but I didn't scheme to get it.
All I did was set up the article and let you do what you always do implode.
One of the things I learned after being run out of Manhattan by a gang of over-privileged teenagers was to just let my anger go.
Fashion design is my art therapy.
So we really just liked the same fabric? I better go write my story.
I don't want to forget any details.
No, no, no! You can't write about this! Wait! Maybe she's right.
If you write that article, it'll bring her so much more attention.
Maybe you should just write it about me.
I could use the extra space for more pictures of your collection.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Where are you going? I can't start again from nothing! Nelly! You can be my head Minion.
Blair Waldorf, I've been asked to escort you from the party.
Think fast, B.
Pencil skirts or peplum? The only look you have now is egg on your face.
Looks good, no? Skilled craftspeople at work.
I've never seen such a beautiful sight.
Where did they come from? Uh, some from Paris, some from Garment District, a few "Project Runway" rejects.
I know how to enlist employees.
I learned from the best.
Hey! She's clapping for you! Thank you, Dorota.
Now as the new head of Waldorf Designs, I only have one chance to make my debut.
At fashion show for buyers next week.
As much as I love the line we were developing, it is no longer viable.
So we simply have to do better.
Miss Blair, I know I know nothing of fashion, but no one can do a whole line in ten days.
I do realize that this is a lot to ask, but we have no choice.
As my mother's first facialist Elizabeth Arden said, "I only want people around me who can do the impossible.
" So we have no time to waste.
I want a picture of every piece my mother has ever designed.
And we need a new inspiration fabric.
So who wants to come with me to Mood? Great! Let's go then.
Vite.
Vite.
Hey! Heard you got a great offer from "Vanity Fair.
" I did.
I said no.
Did Georgina kick you off her couch or what? No, I left on my own after waking up with her staring at me again.
Please tell me that means you're giving your serial to "The Spectator.
" I know you need this to succeed as much as I do, but it's only gonna do that if you print it word for word.
Done.
You might wanna check it out before you decide.
Wow.
You, uh, sure you wanna publish this? I am.
Every word of it is true.
But there are details in here the world doesn't need to know.
These are people you care about.
Nothing good came from my protecting them.
Once I realized I live in a world where Chuck bass gets the girl, everything seemed very clear.
I'm not playing by anyone else's rules anymore.
I'm making my own.
If you don't want this, I I can self-publish it.
No, no, no, I want it.
I'm just saying I've only read one page, and I'm guessing you might lose some friends and family.
My "friends" chased my sister out of town and chose a guy who traded her for a hotel over me.
And my "family" yeah, is sleeping with a con artist.
You know, I'm I'm not I'm not losing anything here.
I'm taking what's mine.
Serena's gala from last night? Yes.
It looks beautiful in the paper.
I heard there was an unfortunate incident with Steven, but the board said that Serena could keep her seat because she raised a record amount of money.
Mm.
Sorry I had to step out and didn't get home in time for us to make it.
Bart, it's lovely.
It is the least I can do to make up for all the unfortunate drama with Amira and Charles.
I know how important family is to you, Lily, but I think you need to accept that my son may no longer want to be part of ours.
Well, I'm not ready to give up hope yet.
No one said being a parent would be easy.
Some children will do everything in their power to destroy you.
Others will wilt under the weight of your crushing expectations.
She know you can do this, Miss Blair.
I hope she's right.
My entire future, here and with Chuck, depends on it.
You're uncharacteristically quiet this morning, Sage.
What do you want me to say? "Thank you for the humiliating experience of being walked to school by my dad and his trophy girlfriend?" I may not be as humiliating as you think.
I went to Constance, too, you know.
Just remember your end of the deal.
I go to school, and you let me date Nate.
Oh, you should thank Serena for that.
She's the one that told me he's a decent guy.
Yeah, he was going to St.
Jude's while I was at Constance, but you probably already know that from "Gossip Girl.
" No one in high school reads "Gossip Girl" anymore.
It's for old people.
Now can I go, or do you want to hold my hand all the way to homeroom? Go.
I love you.
And some will become parents themselves.
What can I say except, uh, welcome to adulthood? You know I disapprove of teenage pregnancy.
"Gossip Girl" says your dad is dating Serena Van Der Woodsen.
Is it true? Not for long.
But a teenage stepdaughter? That's my kind of fun.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I need your passion for social upheaval to help me write the book about the Upper East Side.
Would you prefer the kink of watching your father do it with Fake Charlie again? No, I did not watch.
I got the hell out before they saw me.
As the new head of Waldorf Designs, I only have one chance to make my debut.
At fashion show for Buyers next week.
Please tell me that means you're giving your serial to "The Spectator.
" I know you need this to succeed as much as I do, but it's only gonna do that if you print it word for word.
Done.
What do you want me to say, "thank you for the humiliating experience of being walked to school by my dad and his trophy girlfriend"? "Gossip Girl" says your dad is dating Serena Van Der Woodsen.
Is it true? Not for long.
She know you can do this, Miss Blair.
I hope she's right.
My entire future here and with Chuck depends on it.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Manhattan has weathered her share of storms heat waves, hurricanes, even an earthquake.
But these days, it looks like a new force of nature is taking shape on the Upper East Side.
There's nothing I love more than the sound of a sweatshop in the morning.
That hemline is too short.
And that one is too long.
My debut collection must be perfect.
We haven't been working day and night for the last two weeks to make errors.
The devil is in the details, and I'm about to start worshiping Satan.
Blair, here is the list of it girls walking in tonight's show.
I am so glad Charlotte Casiraghi agreed to be our centerpiece girl.
She is a veritable style icon and the only Monegasque who doesn't hold a grudge.
That is the genius of our strategy.
So what, we missed Fashion Week.
People always take their style cues from real life it girls, anyway.
Our buyers will clamor for the collection the second they see it.
Oui, Blair, which reminds me, I'll go confirm Charlotte's flight now.
Miss Blair, you have no moment for rest in days.
I bring you health shake with kale.
The only green that I'm concerned with right now is the shade of harem pants Lauren Bush will be donning tonight.
Quel dsastre.
Charlotte's lawyers say she has a conflict with another endorsement.
They've made her drop out of the show.
What do we do? Not to worry, Jean Pierre.
I've got this under control.
We'll just have to find someone even more fabulous to feature as the face of Waldorf Designs.
Thank you.
So, sweetie, what's on tap at school today? Do you want some berries? I got 'em fresh at the farmer's market.
Hey, if you wanna be rude to me, I'll put up with it as part of my parental duty, but there is no excuse to be impolite to Serena.
Ah, it's fine.
No, it's not.
Sage, what's the deal? You've been cutting school, and you dropped out out of all the activities that used to matter to you.
Our agreement was that you could date Nate if he didn't distract you from what's important.
Please leave Nate out of this.
Hey.
Look at that.
She actually speaks.
You weren't around all summer, and now all of a sudden, you're the world's awesomest dad trying to impress your trophy girlfriend? Okay.
Wow.
I didn't know that you felt that way, but now that I do, let's talk about it.
Hi, Nate.
No, it's a great time to talk.
Well, there went your teachable moment.
You know, I just don't know what to do with her.
You know, her grades are abysmal.
College is right around the corner.
You know, I hate to say it, but maybe I introduced the two of you too soon.
Well, speaking as someone who had a lot of stepparent types waltz in and out of my life, I know it can be tough, but we'll make it through it, okay? I really, really want that.
Well, it sounds like there's a "but" coming.
Yeah.
I just, you know, wonder if I moved a little too fast here.
I make no excuses for the way she's acting, but she's still a kid.
You know, if she's this upset, I need to deal with it.
Well, yeah, you should definitely talk to her.
You know, I was I was thinking more like, um you know, maybe you and I should take a break.
You know, it's the last thing in the world that I want, but I should focus on Sage, you know, get her Get her back on track.
Well, what if I talk to her? You did hear everything she just said about you.
Well, yeah, but I know how to relate to girls like Sage because I was a girl like Sage not too long ago.
Well, at this point she could hardly hate either of us more.
Therefore, we have nothing to lose.
She'll come around, I promise.
Okay? Okay.
I heard you on the phone earlier this morning.
Didn't sound like Blair.
Deeper voice, darker mind.
My Uncle Jack.
Ah.
His people on the ground in Dubai are helping me to find out who the mystery man with Bart in Amira's photo is.
Did he come up with anything? Not yet.
We got a partial plate off the car.
Tracked down the restaurant it was parked outside of.
So that's a good place to start asking questions.
Well, that's good news.
I mean, maybe someone in the area will recognize him, you know? Yeah, let's hope so.
I may be negotiating with terrorists, but you're harboring a fugitive.
Come on, Monkey.
I I'm sorry about that, man.
He's, you know No, Chuck's barbs don't bother me.
Anything beats having Georgina watch me sleep.
I'm just grateful for a place to crash.
Well, as your roommate and publisher, I am pleased to report that "The Spectator" is finally ready to post its very first Humphrey original.

  Hey, it's a good day, and it's only 9
0 a.
m.
Before I publish, would you wanna warn the subject of this week's serial? You know, let 'em know that they're about to be totally skewered? Yeah.
Uh, yeah, no.
No, I'd rather not.
Are you sure? I mean, this is kinda like when you start sleeping with someone's ex.
It's better better that they hear it from you first.
You should know.
So should you.
You think Graydon Carter makes a courtesy call to the Astors before publishing an expose on them? Yeah, actually.
Post it.
How's the invite list for the gallery opening coming along? Speaking of, who will you be escorting? 'Cause I have the perfect suggestion.
Me.
Well, I would love nothing more than to have you on my arm, uh, but before we announce our relationship status to the world, I have to tell my kids first.
Uh, Jenny sent her blessing from London, but I still haven't connected with Dan.
Well, he'd better hurry up and get back from Europe so I can officially be your girlfriend.
Well, he was gonna do some traveling after his writer's retreat, but he should be back any day now, and I'm sure he'll reach out to us as soon as he returns.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
Look at this.
So who is our new it girl? She's impossible to find.
I've called all of our contacts.
This is Manhattan.
There's an it girl on every corner.
Even on this corner? I can't walk in my show.
Not you.
Serena.
When I was in high school, my mom was remarried a lot.
That must have been so hard for you.
Yeah, it actually was, and I learned the hard way that, you know, if you act out, you're only hurting yourself, so please just try to care about college and stay involved in your extracurriculars.
You're so right, Serena.
And they say you can't be pretty and smart.
And try to go easy on your dad, please.
He's he's a really good man.
That's why I fell in love with him.
Okay, now my ears are bleeding.
But it's cool to talk to someone my own age who actually gets it.
I promise I'll turn over a new leaf.
Thanks, Serena.
Hold on one second.
What do you want? I'm not even going to pretend to be calling you as a friend right now because you have made it quite clear that you are not mine, but I do have a mutually beneficial business opportunity.
I highly doubt that.
I need a power it girl to walk in my show.
You made a splash at the Central Park Conservancy Gala.
I'm guessing that you need something equally as exciting to follow it up.
Oh, well, your concern for my social standing really tugs at my heartstrings, but a fashion show is hardly a life crisis.
It is to me.
My back is up against the wall, and not in a hot Chuck Bass kind of way.
You and I have known each other long enough that we are like family, which means that we have earned the right to hate each other from time to time, but that doesn't mean that there's not still love underneath.
Come on, Serena.
Please.
How many times have I saved you? It's your turn to save me back.
I'm saving someone else now Steven's daughter Sage.
My only focus is her and keeping her on track.
They're my new family.
Maybe you should find a new one, too.
You know what? If Serena doesn't wanna be family, then that's fine.
She can dive right from the gene pool to the cesspool.
My mother is my family.
My mother is always watching like the "Mona Lisa.
" Like the "Mona Lisa" with a lot of expectations! You look pale Like "Mona Lisa.
" This business is my namesake.
It is the family jewel.
It is what Chuck paid my dowry to save! If I'm not successful at this, we might not even end up together! We all root for you to be Blair Waldorf-Bass.
I must match my mother's hard work, dedication, and success.
I can't let her down.
I can't let Chuck down.
Can't let myself down.
They say history repeats itself, but looks like B.
is charting a brand-new course to epic collapse.
Excuse me.
Hey, have you seen this girl? Are you Serena? Yeah.
Yeah.
Where is she? Uh, you just missed her, but she did say you would take care of this.
Hello? Yeah, yeah, everything went as well as it could have.
She thinks just like I did when I was 17.
It's like looking in a mirror.
It seems as if you're suffering from severe exhaustion and dehydration.
Have you been sleeping? Eating? Do I look like I've been eating? Don't insult me.
Miss Blair running around like rhesus monkey.
She take no moment for sleeping or eating or resting or stopping.
Is exhausting me, too.
I have been working harder than a farmhand, but I do have a multimillion dollar brand to build and a fashion show to oversee tonight, so if you'll excuse me.
You're not going anywhere.
If you wanna be at that show, you need to be on bed rest and I.
V.
fluids.
Where did you find this quack? Oh.
Oh! Perhaps I am a wee bit tired.
I'll prepare the I.
V.
I guess I'll just have to deal with running my empire from my own sickbed.
Oh, the state of your shirt makes me think Sage must be close.
Yeah, well, you just missed her.
Where could she have disappeared to now? I just searched every floor of Barney's twice.
You try doing that without stopping to browse at either of the shoe departments.
I think you should just give up the chase.
I can't.
I'm supposed to be mentoring her.
You? Mentor? Just go with it.
She may be 17, but she is wise beyond her years.
She's high school you times ten, believe me.
But Sage's entire goal is to destroy mine and Steven's relationship, and she's succeeding at it, because I've been lying to him all day.
I'm supposed to be keeping her on the straight and narrow, and I have no idea where she is.
Well, if you feel so guilty, maybe you should just come clean.
I can't.
If he knows that I messed this up, he'll wanna take a break, and that's the last thing I want.
He's the most important person in my life right now.
Look, it's his job to handle her, not yours.
Oh, you're right.
Okay.
As hard as it's gonna be, I think I just have to admit defeat.
Well, good luck with that.
I'm around if you need to talk.
Thanks.
You here on one of your famous blackmail missions? I hope you got it all on film.
Suck it, Humphrey.
You should probably button up your shirt.
You are editor-in-chief now.
I just can't figure out how Dan found out about us.
I should have called him so he heard it from me.
He must be in shock.
Oh, my God.
Rufus, you are too good for your own good.
I mean, your son trashes you in the press, and you think you're to blame.
I mean, it was bad enough when Dan fictionalized you in his last book, but this is next level.
I need to talk to him immediately.
Talk? Isn't that what you did last time? And look how well that turned out.
I mean, he's using real names and distorting the truth.
It's libel.
These ad numbers seem pretty promising.
I think my serial might give "The Spectator" a real boost.
Yeah, and more importantly, judging by these online comments at least, the Rufus piece has reached a whole new readership.
I mean, people who actually read over 35s who love vintage indie rock and dirt on other people's divorces.
And since my dad isn't exactly in the "Gossip Girl" demo, there's no way she can undermine this story.
Oh, come on.
This says your dad is gonna sue you, me, and "The Spectator.
" And "Gossip Girl" is breaking the news.
Jean Pierre? You are ruining everything.
The runway is the wrong color.
And who approved those wigs? Even Nicki Minaj knows better.
We will change it all paint the runway, ditch the wigs.
Is that Nelly Yuki I see in the background? She's there for her exclusive interview.
Stall her.
Tell her she's pretty.
She's never heard those words strung together before.
It couldn't get worse, Dorota.
I still haven't found my it girl, and now Nelly Yuki is sniffing around like one of Valentino's little dogs.
Jean Pierre should put a muzzle on her.
Jean Pierre thinks "Muzzle" is the name of our D.
J.
I don't know who else to call.
The minions are on probation because of Poppy-gate, and Dan is still furious with me.
I just want someone who can read my mind.
Is that too much to ask? Hello, Blair.
Serena.
Your ears must be burning.
Yeah? Why? I was just telling my dad about the great opportunity you got me.
Of course.
The great opportunity.
You scored me a prime spot walking in Blair Waldorf's fashion show tonight.
I did, and it's just so exciting.
Who better for me to learn from than a young businesswoman like Blair, running her own company? I do applaud entrepreneurship.
This could lead to a summer internship or maybe a whole career in fashion.
I was just happy to do anything for for sweet Sage.
You know, this is great news.
My two girls getting along.
Thank you.
This means a lot.
You thought I ratted you out, didn't you? Do you really think I care about your childhood baggage? I go to therapy.
I have enough of my own.
Hey, I was just trying to help.
How'd you get a spot in Blair's show? I didn't.
You'll get me in.
Uh it's not that easy.
Nothing ever is with Blair.
Well, then I'll just have to tell my dad that I finally found my true calling, and you squashed it by telling your B.
F.
F.
not to hire me.
They say don't hate the player, hate the game.
But when you invented the rules, losing really stings.
I knew nobody keep you in bed except Mr.
Chuck.
That's why I call him.
I would love to spend the day with you under the duvet, but you're exhausted.
And I know from my brief stint as a candy stripper that an I.
V.
can be quite a hindrance.
So how may I serve? I can't pull you away from taking down Bart.
Well, my hands may be momentarily tied when it comes to my mission against my father.
Task me, Blair.
I can't.
Tasks are for minions or Dan Humphrey.
On second thought, I know exactly what you need done.
And I know exactly how you like it.
No instructions necessary.
Dorota.
I'm feverish! Elton John won $150,000 from "The Sunday Mirror," and all they wrote was he was on some sort of diet where he chewed his food but didn't swallow.
Well, don't worry.
I'm pretty sure my father swallows.
Dan, this isn't funny.
This is exactly why I was saying you should speak to Rufus in the first place.
No, but this isn't like my father at all.
I mean, granted, nothing he's been doing has really been in character, but I just don't believe he would sue.
The last thing he wants to do is tell the truth, the whole truth about banging Ivy Dickens on my sofa.
That doesn't mean that he isn't gonna try to make a point or get a settlement.
Nate, look, if I if I know my dad, all he wants to do is give me a lecture from his perch on mount-holier-than-thou.
We'll be fine.
I'll I'll go talk to him, but just try and take a deep breath and maybe a Xanax or two.
So the show will open with this track.
Here's a list of the rest of the set here with time stamps.
Chuck.
What do you think? I'm speechless.
Is it everything you desired? You read me like tea leaves, Chuck Bass.
It's Jack.
He has a lead on the man in the photo.
I have to Go.
Tonight will be Perfect because of you.
Go find that man.
It means we're one step closer to being together.
Go.
Oh, the ice woman cometh.
I wanted to apologize about our conversation earlier.
I I know that I was way out of line.
Save it, Serena.
What do you want? I need Sage to be in your fashion show.
Ironic, since I need a fabulous it girl to walk in my show.
But Sage is in high school.
Sorry.
Can't help you.
This is your opportunity to discover Sage.
Look, Karl found Naomi.
Calvin invented Christy.
People love a fresh, new face.
So what you're saying is that you wanna use me, your non-family, to make a good impression on your new real family.
Yeah.
Yeah, having Sage in your show will save my relationship with Steven.
Okay.
I'll do it.
Thank you.
On one condition.
For some reason, people care what you think.
So you will sit front row in vintage Eleanor Waldorf, applaud wildly, and gush to anyone who will listen about how fabulous my new collection is.
Done.
You have a deal.
It was almost nice doing business with you.
Sage, come meet Blair.
You're in.
Oh, and stunning.
Thank you.
Tonight's gonna be amazing.
Sage will be working the runway.
Steven and I will be sitting in front row.
But starting tomorrow, you're gonna start caring about some things, okay? I am? Yeah, like attending school and after school activities and making it home in time for curfew and being so, so kind to your father.
Do we understand each other? Perfectly.
I'm so happy we're all getting along.
I have a feeling tonight's going to be very memorable.
Careful, ladies.
Turns out Sage might be a wolf in B.
's clothing.
Thank you.
Can't wait to see your line.
Eleanor will not be attending tonight's show because she trusts me completely.
I feel honored to have earned that trust and excited about the future of Waldorf Designs.
Blair? This way.
Excuse me.
Great.
Oh, thank you.
Here you go.
To Sage's big night and to you for making this all happen.
Oh, and to us and nothing standing in the way of our future.
I'll drink to that.
Oh, of course, when I told you to speak with her, I imagine you igniting her interest in horseback riding or, you know, maybe joining the volleyball team.
You know, modeling wasn't exactly the after school activity I had in mind.
Well, this isn't just about modeling, though.
I mean, Blair has an incredible group of women wearing her clothes, from activists to businesswomen to actresses.
Sage is in great company.
Okay.
Serena.
Steven.
It is such a pleasure to have you here tonight.
Welcome.
And I'm so glad that Sage is in the show.
She's gonna be beautiful.
Can't wait.
Oh.
Look, I see, uh, Anderson Cooper over there.
Excuse me.
I should go congratulate him on his old news becoming new news if that makes sense.
Let me show you your seat.
Okay, well, I need a good view if I'm going to applaud.
Why isn't there a seat for Steven here? Serena, this is prime fashion real estate.
I had to save all the best seats for journalists and influencers, not do-gooding dads, but not to worry.
Steven has a very nice seat behind you in the third row right there.
No, that is so disrespectful.
Do you even care that we're here? Well, of course I care.
You are so transparent, Blair.
You couldn't have a seat for my boyfriend next to me because you had to save it for one of your indentured minions.
Well, th that's not true.
Why even bother to make a deal with me to have me fake-clap when you've already got one of your slaves writing a fake story about how wonderful your line is? For your information, I'm a very real "Women's Wear Daily" reporter.
Yes, Nelly Yuki, a very real reporter who happens to look incredibly gorgeous tonight and who I am thrilled to have sitting in the front row.
And I haven't the slightest clue what fake deal Serena is referring to.
Nobody likes a fashion counterfeit.
You're right.
I would never be caught dead wearing a knockoff, and if tonight really is about honesty, then maybe I will sit next to Nelly, and I will give her all of my genuine opinions.
That's right.
Serena.
All your true, nice opinions.
Nobody likes a Debbie Downer or a Serena sabotage.
I'm sorry that I didn't let you read it first.
That would've been the honest thing to do.
And I'm sorry that you had to find out about Ivy from someone other than me.
But We're together now, and, uh, admittedly, it's it's getting serious.
W dad, she she's a known con artist.
She swindled Lily and her entire family.
And, you may remember from my article, she tried to have s*x with me and asked me to call her "Serena.
" Dan, you're my son, and we have to find a way to put this behind us.
But when it comes to Ivy, you're way out of line.
I'm an adult, and you need to respect my decision to be with her.
Being with her is the adult decision? Throughout my entire life, you have portrayed yourself as the moral compass, the guy who always does the right thing.
According to Rufus Humphrey, there's no road like the high road.
Yes, I believe in doing the right thing.
So can't you see what you're doing with your life? Your whole thing is a lie.
At least I wrote the truth, and the truth, which, by the way, is a defense against a libel, so you've got no case.
Case? I don't want a case.
I just wanna have a real conversation with my son, so let me know if you see him around.
I will.
I gotta go.
That didn't sound like it went very well.
Did you leak news that I was threatening to sue my son? I am definitely the luckiest guy in Manhattan.
I look okay? You look amazing.
And if I spend any more time back here staring at you, that robe's gonna end up crumpled up in the corner.
So I'm just gonna wish you luck and take my seat.
Can it end up crumpled in the corner later? Absolutely.
You know, this looks nice on you, but I think I have something Serena might like even better.
Come with me.
Erica Winograd! It's great seeing one of my advertisers out on the town.
Likewise, Nate.
Listen, I wanted to thank you for choosing to advertise with us at "The Spectator" this week.
It's been a real pleasure doing business with you and your team.
We were very excited about Dan Humphrey's inaugural serial.
We knew it would draw a lot of eyeballs.
And it has, and I know Dan's piece next week will garner even more attention.
You should definitely think about buying up some more space for that one as well.
We did, Nate, in "Vanity Fair.
" Wait.
I'm I'm sorry.
What? Dan's serial is continuing in "Vanity Fair.
" Yeah, I thought "The Spectator" was just a onetime occurrence, which is too bad for me because Graydon is charging ten times as much as you did for ad space.
I'm sorry, Erica.
I I have to go right now.
And different.
You know, it could work.
She pulls it off.
I like it.
H have you guys lost your minds? This isn't fashion forward or provocative or couture.
It it's exploitation, and it's embarrassing.
Okay, Alexa, it's your turn.
Show must go on.
No one cares about one person's silly opinion.
So strut! Yep, I'm out of here.
There's no way in hell I'm going out there.
Oh.
Don't go.
W It's B.
's party, and she'll cry if she wants to, 'cause looks like this birthday suit isn't exactly cause for celebration.
I only did it because I wanted to protect you.
No one ever stands up for you.
I thought if I threatened a lawsuit on "Gossip Girl," "The Spectator" would have to retract Dan's piece.
Standing up for me is one thing, but you shouldn't interfere in matters between me and my son.
I I apologize, Rufus.
I wasn't thinking about the consequences, but Dan did publish this piece to hurt you.
There are other ways to fight back, Ivy.
No.
The only way to deal with the world of the Upper East Side is to fight fire with fire.
Dan may have been an innocent Brooklyn boy once, but while you weren't looking, he became as ruthless as any Park Avenue prince.
I'm sorry I inserted myself in your battle, but it broke my heart to see you trashed so viciously.
Well, his words may have been nasty, but Dan wrote the truth.
We are together.
And I want you by my side, here and at the gallery opening.
Mmm.
Why the hell do my advertisers think that "Vanity Fair" is publishing the rest of your serial? Because they are.
Dan, we had a deal.
A handshake is hardly a deal.
Oh, my God.
I think I'm gonna hit you.
I told you last week it was a bad idea to mix business and friendship.
You wanted me to go to Rufus before publishing the piece, and today when he when he threatened a lawsuit, you freaked out.
I was trying to protect my newspaper.
What do you want me to say? "Vanity Fair" is the big-time, and the more readers I have, the more power I have.
It is that simple.
I thought we were in this together.
We were, and then something better came long.
Okay, now I know I wanna hit you.
Come on, Nate.
You know you and all of your other friends would've done the exact same thing in my position.
You know what? Don't bother coming back to The Empire.
Find another place to stay.
I thought you might say that.
Dave Berger.
You used to work for Bart Bass a while back as a bodyguard.
He fired me.
I got nothing to say about that guy.
I just have a few questions about a weekend you spent with Bart in Dubai, about four years ago.
Like I said, I got nothing.
Mr.
Bass makes everyone sign a nondisclosure agreement.
I don't know who you are, but I know better than to cross him.
Think of me as a friend, a compadre, a fellow fighter.
This gym is pretty nice.
It's all right.
Perhaps you'd like to own it instead of just working here.
Personally, I've always taken great pleasure in being my own boss.
How could you do this to me? Just because I didn't give your geriatric boyfriend a seat doesn't mean that you had to tell Sage to sabotage my show! Save it, Blair.
You were so upset that I care more about Steven than your show that you had to destroy my relationship.
I didn't tell her to take off the dress.
You did.
No, I didn't.
I would much rather avoid the child pornography charges.
Well, if I didn't tell her to take off the dress, and you didn't tell her to take off the dress, then who did? I happened to like the underwear more.
Sage, you get in this car right now.
We are going home.
I'll see you later.
Looks like these besties were bested by a newbie.
When Sage's dress came off, they both came undone.
Steven, I'm so sorry.
It's all my fault.
She's right.
It is all her fault.
She gave me all this advice and told me to use her as a role model.
Save it, Sage.
I know you set Serena up.
I should've known as soon as you started talking about the fashion show that you were planning something.
Serena isn't the one who should be apologizing.
It's you.
I'm waiting.
Serena, I'm sorry that you weren't clever enough to figure out what I was up to.
Sage, I am warning you.
I apologize.
I shouldn't have taken advantage of you.
It won't happen again.
Good.
Now I'm gonna contemplate your punishment while I make us all some tea.
It's been a very long night.
For the record, I didn't mean a word of that.
I'm not sorry at all.
Well, for the record, I don't care.
Why don't you just try to wrap your little machiavellian brain around the fact that your father and I are gonna be together no matter what you do? So you're gonna have to get used to me, sweetheart.
Chamomile or mint? I just got off the phone with Jean Pierre.
It's a fashion prognosis of disastrous proportion.
Not one buyer has made an appointment to place an order.
And to make things worse, Nelly Yuki trashed me in "Women's Wear Daily.
" "Can Blair Waldorf step into her mother's shoes, or is her Achilles' heel of the stripper variety?" Dorota, I have been relegated to clear heels and Kardashian tastes! I always know this Nelly a real snake.
It doesn't even matter if the clothes are good.
Serena walked out, and everyone followed.
Once again, I have been defeated at the hands of Serena Van Der Woodsen.
She's the double-edged sword of my very existence.
Miss Blair must keep chin up, must keep company going.
You will make Miss Eleanor proud.
I know because I proud already.
My mother.
How am I gonna explain this to her? Eleanor Waldorf does not take kindly to the "F" word "Failure.
" Save the Dom, Chuck.
I would rather die.
I am the laughingstock of the fashion press.
The clothes were beautiful, and you are beautiful, and that is something we need to celebrate.
You say celebrate.
I say drown my sorrows.
Give me the bottle.
Tolstoy wrote that all happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, especially on the Upper East Side.
You know, Sage can be a handful, but you handled tonight with true grace.
I'm impressed.
Mmm.
Some are only too happy to be distracted from their pain.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Well, I had an awful day with "The Spectator.
" I had a really awful day with the Serena.
I'm not wearing my robe anymore, but my clothes can still end up in the corner.
Well I guess I could help you out with that.
While others choose to bite the hand that feeds them, even when they have no idea where their next meal is coming from.
I heard you sold your serial to "Vanity Fair" this morning.
I can't believe they bought it ten minutes after it was posted.
You're very up on current events.
Word travels fast in the publishing industry.
I guess you took my advice and started playing by your own rules.
How does it feel? Uh, weird.
Kinda dirty but good.
Like you said, the truth is a very powerful thing.
Well, if you have nowhere to go you can always stay with me.
Are you Dan Humphrey? I am.
I read your piece in "The Spectator" today and I loved it.
Can I buy you a drink? Absolutely.
So there you have it.
Dave Berger worked as a bodyguard for my father.
He was there that weekend with Amira.
Dave drove Bart to meet someone named Lady Alexander.
Dave wasn't in the meeting, so that's all he could tell me.
I don't know who she is, what she does, or even where to start looking for her.
We will find her.
I'm all yours, mind, body, and scheme.
You helped me with my show tonight, and, at least for the first few hours before the big fashion fiasco, everything was perfect.
And I can help you, too.
Let's face it.
We need each other.
I need you right now.
For one night, make an exception.
A gentleman wouldn't take advantage of a lady who's had more than her half of the bottle of Dom.
But the exception I'll make is this we join forces, combine our power, and achieve our goals that much sooner.
Ahem.
Fine.
We're in this together.
And I will try with every fiber of my being to behave.
But whether your family is happy or unhappy, it's always best to stick together because some ties are simply unbreakable.

Gossip Girl here, your one and only source, into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Dan's serial is continuing in Vanity Fair.
Dan, we had a deal! Vanity Fair is the big time.
And the more readers I have the more power I have.
It's that simple.
Dan wrote the truth.
We are together.
And I want you, by my side, here, and at the gallery opening.
Are you Dan Humphrey? I am.
I read your piece in "The Spectator" today.
Can I buy you a drink? Absolutely.
Did this really happen? You and Serena? Every dirty detail, exactly as it occurred.
She said she erased it, but did you actually see her do it? What is wrong with you? You had someone who loved you unconditionally, and you threw that all away to let Chuck Bass decide when he's ready for you? I just have a few questions about a weekend you spent with Bart in Dubai about four years ago.
Dave drove Bart to meet someone named lady Alexander.
I don't know who she is or even where to start looking for her.
We will find her.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

, Gossip Girl.
(Gossip girl) Extra, extra, read all about it the latest upper east sider to take center stage in the social spotlight.
But you know what they say? If you can't take the heat, then move to Hell's Kitchen.
(White arrows' "I can go" playing) "Nate Archibald has the opposite of the Midas touch.
Instead of everything he touches turning to gold, he turns all the gold he's been given to dust.
" Your friend's poor, right? I mean, he's probably just jealous.
Oh, first of all, Dan screwed me over by selling the serialization of his new book right out from under me, and then he releases the chapter about me.
You look really hot in the picture.
Who cares what it says? He's saying that I'm single-handedly destroying "The Spectator.
" Okay, enough.
This Dan guy is full of it.
No, actually, if he was making stuff up, you know, I'd be mad, but I'd get over it.
Thing is, he's right.
(Sighs) "The Spectator" is in serious financial trouble, and it's all my fault.
It's why I'm meeting with the bank later today to hopefully extend our credit line.
Can I help? Please.
I am dying for an excuse to skip brunch with my dad and Serena Van Der Floozy.
(Chuckles) No, that's nice, but you should go to brunch, and you should be nice to Serena, all right? She's the one who convinced your dad to let us keep dating, all right? Give her a chance.
(Georgina) Your article on Nate is generating major online buzz.
Huffpo has a link on their main page, and Dwight Garner just tweeted about it, saying that he's halfway through and doesn't hate it yet.
Even "Gossip Girl" gave us a nice plug.
Overall, the reaction's been positive for you, that is.
Not for Nate.
Are they talking about how the use of real names makes this my "In cold blood"? I mean, do they like the writing? Are they making any comparisons to historical literary figures? Perez Hilton.
But the important thing is that they're talking about it.
Literary celebrity is fleeting.
We have to make the most of it.
Trust me.
I have been.
I am not talking about trolling for lit groupies at McNally's and sleeping with your coffee dates.
Well, that's how I'm finding a bed to sleep in every night.
Look, being a writer in 2012 isn't merely about the words that you write.
It's about your image.
So from now on, you're only going to be seen with girls who have Ivy League pedigrees, or, at the very least, Vassar.
She needs to have cover girl looks and at least three mentions in "Page Six" in the last six months.
How exactly am I gonna do that? I've already set up the interviews.
(Clears throat) This is the guy my daughter's dating? Have you read this article on Nate? Oh, I'm not a fan of the author's previous work.
Well, let me summarize for you.
His last girlfriend was a madam.
Before that, he dated con artists with an "S" because, yes, there was more than one.
Your friend Dan wrote all this? Dan Humphrey's a douche.
Well, you can forget about dating the guy in this article ever again.
That's fine by me.
Nate is nothing like the guy in that article.
Well, I don't know what Dan wrote, but I can vouch for Nate.
He's kind and honest and a good friend.
And and he cares about Sage a lot.
You should get to know him before you judge him.
Or at least before you hit him again.
Dad, can he come to the horse show with us? This afternoon? No, that's always been our thing.
Oh, come on.
You hate it, and you know it.
It'll give you someone to talk about football with instead.
(Gasps) Nate loves football.
See? Look, we're already finding things to bond over.
Oh, I guess he can join us.
It'll give me a chance to talk to him.
Possibly threaten his life.
I'll see if he can come.
Thanks, dad.
You, too, Serena.
Did you see that? She almost smiled at me.
Hmm.
And don't worry about Nate.
You'll really like him.
He's the best.
Well, you would know.
When were you gonna tell me you've had s*x with my daughter's boyfriend? Okay.
This is definitely a a fire hazard.
I think it's time to unpack the boxes Lily sent over.
Sorry, I've been so busy with this new gallery opening.
I'm actually headed over there now.
Don't take this the wrong way, but maybe you're using the gallery as an excuse to avoid going through your old life.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Is it? (Chuckles) These boxes are full of stuff from your time with Lily, and I can see how revisiting those memories could be difficult.
Look, let me help.
I will unpack the boxes, and when you come back, they'll be gone.
That would be nice.
Keep the things that we can use around the loft and just throw everything else out.
(Door opens and closes) (Scoffs and chuckles) Gosh.
(Sighs) "May 17, 2008.
Dear Rufus, last night was the best night of my life" (Steven) It's kind of a big deal not to mention.
(Sighs) I wasn't trying to hide my past with Nate.
I swear it was a long time ago.
We're just friends now, and besides, when is something like that supposed to come up? I don't know.
Maybe the second he started dating my daughter? Sage knows, and she doesn't care.
I don't see what the big deal is.
I don't know everyone that you've been with.
You're right.
We both have pasts, but mine's not about to be chronicled in a magazine.
There's bound to be a Serena chapter soon, right? Maybe it's time we have the conversation Discuss everyone we've been wit to avoid any more embarrassing surprises in print or at parties.
Everyone? Well, within reason.
(Sighs) Second base and beyond.
Kissing doesn't count.
I think it's a great idea.
I just have to run an errand first.
When you get back then.
(Kisses) (Beep) (Beep) (Cell phone rings) (Ring) (Beep) That Eleanor again? Debriefing my mother on Waldorf Designs can wait.
She knows I have no buyers, and she's just calling to yell at me.
Besides, I have much more pressing business to attend to, like finding Lady Alexander, whoever and wherever she may be.
Now I've gone through the peerage registries of all the royals in Western Europe, and the closest I could find was a Lady Alexandria of Lisbon, but she died 50 years ago in a Portuguese mental hospital.
I am starting to think my father had his bodyguard feed us bad intel.
That is in Bart's playbook, but I'm having one of those psychic hunches I get, like when I predicted tom and Katie wouldn't last.
You didn't have to be psychic to call that one.
I know this may be a little crazy.
My mother has a friend called Lady Vaughn, only "Lady" isn't her title.
It's her name.
She literally changed it to sound more important so she could sit on the boards of all the big museums, and it worked.
Maybe Lady Alexander did the same.
(Key clicks) There she is.
Lady Alexander.
But it says she's not on the board.
It's a portrait in a private showing.
By the artist Brian Batt.
I know him! I mean, I I know his work.
He has a studio downtown.
I always wanted to commission a portrait of you.
Hmm.
(Cell phone alert chimes) (Beep) What's wrong? The eggs overcooked again? No.
Well, actually, yes, but that's not what's so upsetting.
Eric just texted me from Sarah Lawrence telling me I was on "Gossip Girl".
This is about our wedding? No, the night before, when I slept with Rufus.
That's old news.
I have no idea why I'm suddenly on the radar of this childish blog.
I think it's fairly obvious what kind of child would be putting out such stories.
Charles? No, he would never.
He shipped a woman in from Dubai to drive a wedge in between us.
I'm sorry he keeps dragging you into our fight.
Well, maybe that's why he hasn't returned my calls.
I'll take care of it.
(Whispers) Okay.
(The Cold & Lovely's "Paper and gun" playing) I love how you combine the classic portraiture with pop culture, but we really came to see your portrait of Lady Alexander.
Friends of ours saw it in your private show at the MET, and they suggest we mimic the style.
I wanna do the exact same pose.
I think you've got the wrong guy.
I don't do that sort of thing.
Obviously, we wouldn't want to compromise your artistic integrity by recreating someone else's pose.
Unless it's okay with her.
And we tripled your fee.
I don't mind calling Lady Alexander myself.
See, I generally don't take no for an answer.
So if you'd simply provide a phone number Looks like Chuck's Midas touch is still intact.
I really hope we're not talking about the same Lady Alexander.
Here she is.
But a horse by any other name is still a horse.
And Chuck and Blair can't seem to buy a clue.
Assuming that Lady Alexander isn't related to Mr.
Ed, it appears we've hit another dead end.
Well, not exactly.
Thoroughbred registries have all the important info on every sale, such as prices and previous owners.
It's like M.
L.
S.
for horses.
So find the horse, find the owner.
Here she is Lady Alexander.
It says she was bought four years ago by Bartholomew Bass.
What else does it say? Well, not much except she was just under $1 million.
Is that a lot of money? For regular people, yes.
I meant for a horse.
(Beep) I didn't realize your father was such a horse enthusiast.
He's not.
Well, then Why did he buy a dozen thoroughbreds in a single month? Let me see that.
It says here he bought them all from the same man in Dubai.
I don't recognize the name, and I've been through the Bass Industries books with a fine-toothed comb.
Maybe your father's secret is that he's just into horses really, really expensive horses.
I doubt he'd pay off Amira for that.
I need to find Sheikh Hassan.
There is a big 3-day horse show going on just outside the city right now.
I saw it on one of the registries.
It it attracts an elite international crowd.
Maybe if the Sheikh isn't there himself, he has people there for him? Looks like we're back in the saddle.
You you have a house in the Hamptons, too? And in Aspen and in St.
Barth's, too.
Sorry.
Tiffany.
Time's up.
Don't call us.
We'll call you.
 Okay, you both know the drill.
Skip the small talk and get down to business.
You have five minutes.
 Serena.
Are you here to interview for the position? I'm sorry.
Do you work here now? As if.
I'm pimping out celebutantes for Dan to have s*x with.
If you're interested, you can, uh, get in line.
 Uh, Dan told me to meet him here.
I'll just be two minutes.
That's fine, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave your bag.
We can't risk any unauthorized recording devices.
His words are worth too much.
No, the bank has all my paperwork, okay? And you've seen the numbers, and they're good.
No, I I get that there's a lot of money going out the door each month, okay? But just, with a little more time, I know I can turn things around.
I understand.
Thank you.
Who let you in here? That article this morning was unfairly biased.
It's my job to report on other people's business.
I'd be a hypocrite to get upset about it.
Plus, "The Spectator" just got plugged in a popular national magazine.
The glass is half full approach, huh? Yeah.
I know your paper is in trouble.
I also know that you are a lot smarter than that article makes you out to be.
So I am here to offer you some relief.
Let's talk.
So what's so important you had to see me in person? And allow Georgina to frisk you? I I need to know, did you write a chapter about me? Of course I did.
You really think my father or Nate are more interesting than the infamous Serena Van Der Woodsen? Okay, but I need to know what's in it and when it comes out.
Well, that would ruin all the fun.
Dan, I'm serious.
Did you write about that night that we were together at the Campbell apartment? (Sighs) Relax.
I didn't publish any of that.
(Exhales) But not to protect you.
Um, because it was the most humiliating thing I've ever been a part of.
But don't worry.
There's there's gonna be some good stuff in your chapter.
 I think I might even include a little tidbit of this desperate conversation.
Wow, I I can't believe I ever loved someone who could write such awful things about his friends and family.
Right, 'cause you were thinking about my feelings when you made that s*x tape.
You know what? The worst part is you actually seem to be enjoying it.
Serena, wait a second.
Wait.
On your way out, just let Georgina know that I gotta take a bathroom break.
Thanks for stopping by.
Uh, Dan says have the next girl meet him in the bathroom.
Mmm.
That's more like it.
(Beep) Hey.
I just finished my errand.
Yeah, I got everything I needed.
So you back "The Spectator," and I put out fluff pieces on you and Lily to offset her bad press on "Gossip Girl"? I know you did well with that article on Rufus, and mature readers help broaden your demo.
You will have the extra cash you need.
And as for me, a happy wife is a happy life.
Hmm.
Next thing I know, you'll be asking me to write bad press on Chuck, huh? (Chuckles) I'm not looking for another partner.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna handle this one on my own.
I have no doubt you will succeed, especially if you've inherited your father's gift with numbers.
He was always so inventive.
(Sighs) (Taps button) (Beep) Hey, it's Nate.
Listen, I have a business proposition for you.
(Cell phone rings) (Ring) (Beep) Well at least I know your phone is working.
What I don't know is why you're avoiding my calls.
It's nothing personal.
As you know, I've been avoiding my father.
And, well, you're married to him.
Does that mean you're behind the stories about me on "Gossip Girl"? Is that what he told you? I hope you know I would never do something like that to you.
Well, I needed to hear it from you.
I also need for you to end this feud with your father.
I love both of you, and I can't stand to be in the middle of it a second longer.
I appreciate your desire to bring us back together, but we were never close to begin with.
The man's idea of father/son bonding was teaching me how to diversify bonds.
It's always been business between us.
Well, I got us tickets to the horse show, but it starts in an hour, so Oh.
Hello, Lily.
Oh, well, you don't mean the one at the Stone Orchard stables? It is.
I I don't Chuck? Oh, I haven't been in years.
It's a fabulous event.
And a wonderful opportunity, Charles, for you and your father to talk about something other than business and start to make amends.
I'm gonna see if he's available.
Oh, please.
No, don't tell him.
This should be a surprise.
(Knock on door) Well, that was fast.
So what's this big business opportunity you mentioned on the phone? Mind if I come in? Looks like Chuck and Blair aren't the only ones with a surprise visitor.
So much for Golden Boy going it alone.
So what's with all the boxes? Are you moving in, or is Rufus moving out? It's Rufus' stuff from Lily's.
I know you released the story about Rufus suing Dan, so I figured out you might also be behind all the stories about Lily on "Gossip Girl.
" Ooh.
Well, now I know where you got all the ammo from.
Lily acts so high and mighty, but look at her.
She's been married a dozen times, she's had countless affairs, a secret kid, she's even spent time under house arrest, but never pays the price.
And why should Rufus suffer while Lily's reputation remains unscathed? I agree.
You do? But Lily's friends don't read "Gossip Girl.
" So you should put the stories out on "The Spectator.
" I can see why you don't feel like socializing with your father, but why would you insist on keeping your attendance at an equestrian event a secret? I could care less about the horses.
I'm looking at the property as long as my father and I are both in the real estate game in New York, there will never be peace in our family.
Stone Orchard is for sale? Uh-huh.
Oh, my God.
What a shame.
It's been in the same family for two centuries.
Well, I heard they lost a fortune in Facebook stock.
I'm just exploring the possibility, and I don't want Bart to know until it's real.
This is fantastic, Charles.
Good for you! I am so proud of you for thinking outside of the box, and outside of Manhattan.
(Chuckles) I know the place quite well.
I actually put my horses there when we first moved back out east.
And I mean, I could show you around? (Mouths word) I promise, not a word of this to your father.
Ooh.
Well, then there was Ben, who, contrary to some forged documents, I didn't sleep with when I was 15.
Not until after he got out of prison, and that was the last guy I was with before you.
You said that was a year and a half ago.
Not even one random hook-up between the jailbird and me? No.
I swore off men.
I just wanted to focus on myself.
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, I know that must be hard for you to believe, since you spent the entire winter focusing on the "Sports Illustrated" swimsuit models.
Wait, wait.
Come on.
You saw that cat daddy video.
(Laughs) (Laughs) So that's it, then? We're we're good? I feel prepared for anything that could be published.
Okay.
(Scoffs) No.
Just no.
Did, uh, Nate get back to you about the, uh, horse show? He's got some work to do.
He's gonna meet us there.
I'm really glad he's going.
Go easy on him, okay? Serena, did you want to come, too? I mean, if my dad wants you to.
Oh.
Well, I I don't want to intrude.
No.
No, no, come.
You can keep Sage occupied while I interrogate her boyfriend.
(Chuckles) Bart, dear, I know you're going to be devastated, but I was thinking we should cancel our dinner with the Kranzlers this evening.
Gee, that's too bad.
I was looking forward to dodging all their questions about my disappearance.
Well, don't worry.
We'll reschedule.
You needn't bother, Lily.
What else did you have in mind instead? Well, I was suddenly in the mood for a spa overhaul masSage, facial, nails, the works.
Are you still upset about Chuck and those stories on "Gossip Girl"? Because I'm planning to stop by The Empire and have a talk with him.
Oh, I don't think that's necessary.
I spoke to Charles, and he said he didn't leak those stories, and I believe him.
So I'll call you when I'm done, okay? Sure.
(Beep) Thank you for keeping this between us.
I hate lying, but there's no reason to concern your father if it helps you with your plan to make peace.
Trust me.
If he found out, he'd run everything.
Sometimes it's best not to call in order to avoid being called out later.
(Lily) Just smell the air so crisp and clean.
And fertilized.
You know, there is so much to show you.
This could take all afternoon.
Oh! Uh, uh, did you see that woman over there waving at you? Which one? The one that looks like Princess Anne.
She's saying your name and waving.
Are you sure? Ah.
Well, maybe I should go say hello.
I don't want to be rude.
Mm.
Excuse me.
Okay, now it's your chance! Go! Run! Blair, this isn't a hostage situation.
I don't even know who to excuse me.
Can you tell me if any of Sheikh Hassan's horses are competing today? Mm just one Crown Jewel.
She's on the course.
Thank you.
Okay, look.
I'll go and see what I can find out about Sheikh Hassan.
If you can keep Lily occupied for a few I got a closer look, and it is Princess Anne with her daughter Zara, but are you sure she was waving at me? Because we've never actually met before.
Maybe she was just swatting away mosquitoes or airing out her pits.
Hmm.
(Laughs) Well, either way, where should we begin our tour? Mm-hmm.
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
I (Sighs) No, it's okay.
We just got here ourselves.
Nate, this is my dad.
You remember his fist, right? Ah.
Yeah, sorry about that.
I've never actually punched anyone before.
You definitely did a good job.
It hurt, so Hey, do you wanna go check out the horse? Yeah.
You guys stay and bond over how great I am and how you want me to be happy, okay? Great.
Bye! You know, just so you know, I had to ice my hand all night.
Probably hurt me more than it you.
(Chuckles) And I should probably tell you I am a huge fan of the business you've built.
I've been following your career for forever now.
So You're not dating my daughter just to get to me, are you? No, sir.
It's just a purely added bonus.
Whoa! Whoa! You may be dating my daughter, but I'm dating your ex.
That cancels out the need for any "sirs.
" (Laughs) (Man over P.
A.
speaking indistinctly) Lily, hi! Hi! It's so nice to see you back at the barn.
Thank you, Jessica.
Great to see you as well.
(Chuckles) Enjoy the rest of your day.
Ah! Thank you.
If you ladies wanna get a drink, I think I'll check out the stables.
Now leaving the course Crown Jewel, owned by Sheikh Hassan, ridden by the Sheikh's daughter Iman.
Oh, I think the stables are this way.
Actually, Lily (Chuckles) can we take a little detour? You know, I've been considering an equestrian *** for my next line, and I want you to introduce me to those women in the fabulous fascinators.
Next on the course (Speaking indistinctly) That is a beautiful horse.
I'd love to talk to you about buying it.
(Francisco the man's "Dreams" playing) So who's it gonna be? Personally, I think Melissa has the better face for photos, but Natasha is a Coppola, and that does come with a certain cachet.
Well, I have to choose now? Obviously.
But can't it wait? I mean, I'm I'm I'm exhausted.
Oh, suck it up, Humphrey.
They have pills for that.
These girls are perfect.
They all come from great neighborhoods, have very high I.
Qs, and dress in designer labels.
They meet all of our requirements.
This just isn't me.
These girls might be perfect on paper, but they're not who I'm looking for.
Who you're since when are you looking for anybody? Don't go soft on me now, Humphrey.
Finding true love was never part of our deal.
 (Sighs) I'm sorry you're not selling.
She's absolutely stunning.
Thank you.
My family takes great pride in our thoroughbreds.
I know.
I've been a big fan of your family's horses since I was a child.
There was one in particular I remember seeing compete.
I think she was yours.
Lady Alexander? (Chuckles) Lady Alexander was my childhood horse.
She was much loved but never competed a day in her life.
My father must've loved her as much as then, because he paid a great deal for her.
Again, you're mistaken.
She was sold to a family friend several years ago and put to pasture.
She was worthless to anyone but me.
Which made her priceless.
Uncle Bart! So good to see you.
I see my son is attempting to work his charms on you.
Why didn't you tell me Bart Bass is your father? He's like family.
Our fathers were such good friends before his accident.
Speaking of which, I was sorry to hear of his recent passing.
Is that I think that's Serena.
(Sage) You know her? Uh, yeah.
That's my mom.
(Cell phone ringing) Come on.
I'll introduce you.
Grandma.
Oh, no, no.
Don't call her that.
Yeah, as much as I'd love to stay and chat with your charming daughter, I have to take this call from my mother.
Oh, tell Eleanor I said hello.
Mm.
(Chuckles) Serena, darling, I had no idea you were coming to this.
(Kisses) Oh, yeah.
It was just a last-minute decision.
But I want you to meet Steven's daughter Sage.
Hi.
It's nice to meet you.
Oh, likewise.
Um, you're so much more mature than I'd imagined.
(Laughs) I should probably go check on my dad and Nate.
Okay, I'll be right there.
How old is she? Oh, you know what? This is probably my fault that you have a father complex.
Wait, so you really played basketball at Duke? (Laughs) You're really that gullible? No.
No, unlike the other chemical engi-nerds, I did watch a few games.
Hey, some people call it gullible.
I like to call it trusting.
(Both chuckle) It seems like you guys are getting along.
No black eyes at least.
No, you were you were right about this guy.
He's trusting, which may have led to some poor business decisions but it makes for good character.
He reminds me a little of myself at his age.
Hey, that means a lot, man.
Thanks.
Okay, I wanted you guys to get along.
There's no need for a full-on bromance.
Where's Serena? She ran into her mom.
Wait.
Lily's here? (Cell phone alerts chime) Do you know if he still wants to have kids? I mean, maybe he's done.
Mother! Can we have this conversation somewhere else? People are starting to stare.
Oh.
(Scoffs) It's probably another one of those "Gossip Girl" stories about me.
Oh, I hope it ends soon.
Oh, no, it's it's not a "Gossip Girl" blast.
It's a "Spectator" blast about both of us.
"Like mother, like daughter.
They not only share the same taste in clothing but also in men.
Looks like Steven Spence put age before beauty by sleeping with Lily before Serena"? Excuse me.
Hey, Serena, wait.
Did you just omit someone from our conversation? Like, I don't know, my mother? What what are you talking about? Your love life is the one being published on "The Spectator.
" I had no idea that the story was about him, okay? I I gave it to my editor so I could be here with Sage and get to know Steven.
Well, thanks to you, we all know him better now.
Way to go, Nate.
Dad, seriously? Gross.
(Scoffs) Yeah, I I have no idea why there's a story about me sleeping with your mother.
It's not true! (Sighs) Actually, it is.
There are two sides to every story, with the truth and Serena stuck smack in the middle.
I think you're confusing me with someone else.
Unfortunately, I'm not.
Okay, well, one of you is wrong, and I really hope it's you, mom.
I know we've met a few times socially, you know, through the Central Park Conservancy.
And the Bancroft wedding? The one in the Irish castle.
We snuck down to the dungeon, opened the oldest bottle of whiskey we could find.
My last name was Mueller then.
Klaus' ex? Lily Mueller.
Oh, my God.
Oh! So it is true? Look, it (Sighs) it was it it was right after my divorce.
You know, I had gone skiing in Verbier, and hurt my knee.
There were there were painkillers and and whiskey and (Inhales deeply) oh, wow.
Is that why you were so cold to me at Conservancy events? I didn't know about the painkillers.
Yeah.
But you did know that we were dating.
Why didn't you say anything? What was I supposed to say? I I you you told me that you two were madly in love and that he could be the one.
Besides I figured Steven should be the one to tell you.
Well, I guess this was one of those surprises we were hoping to avoid.
This is your final notice.
(Speaking indistinctly) In five minutes.
What the hell do you think you're doing here, talking to Iman? Enjoying the horses.
Same as you, right? Because Lily would hate to learn that you had me followed.
You need to stop sticking your nose in where it doesn't belong and leave Lily out of this.
Do we understand each other? I didn't realize you'd become such an animal lover.
I have a dog, too.
I find the company of animals preferable to some people.
Another weakness you didn't inherit from me.
I pulled the story off the site, okay? I got ahold of some old list Lily made.
You know, the names of everyone that she had ever slept with.
I I swear I didn't know your dad's name was on it.
Everything was going so well.
My dad was really starting to like you.
I screwed up.
I'm sorry.
I should've vetted the article before it ever came out.
What do you have against Serena's mom anyway? Nothing.
I don't have anything against her.
I just it was a it was a it was a desperate move to save my company.
It was a mistake.
Well, you decided to do it on your own for a reason.
I did, and I think I know of a way that I can without hurting anyone that I care about.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
Okay? I'm really sorry.
And I just I don't want to lose "The Spectator.
" Or you.
(Horse whinnies) I just saw Lily leaving with Bart.
Did you not tell him you tracked down the Sheikh? Doesn't matter.
Sheikh's dead, and the daughter won't talk.
She won't? Why not? (Inhales and exhales deeply) She calls him "Uncle Bart.
" We're done here.
Shall we? Uh, I'll meet you at the car.
I need the ladies' room after all those mint juleps.
Right.
Next on the course (Speaking indistinctly) Owned by the Kelly stables.
Iman? Hi.
I'm Blair.
I'm a close friend of Chuck's.
I know he left before he could speak to you, but this is important to him, and so it's important to me.
Is this about the horse? Because I know Chuck never really wanted it.
He was just flirting with me.
I don't think he was flirting with you.
Look, I know how much these horses mean to you and meant to your father.
Unfortunately, they don't mean that much to Bart.
He isn't exactly a big donator at P.
E.
T.
A, if you know what I mean.
I'm not sure I do.
Well, Bart Bass.
Killed a tiger on safari? He eats veal on a regular basis? I don't know about any of that, but he was a good friend to my father.
He bought Lady Alexander and the others so they could live out their days on a farm in Virginia.
Okay.
Listen, Princess Jasmine, the fact is, your Uncle Bart is bad.
I'm sure every single horse he bought from your family went straight to the glue factory, including your beloved Lady Alexander.
But, if you like, go ahead.
Check it out.
See if you find the Bart Bass retirement home for aged equines.
Trust me, Chuck is the good guy here, and he needs your help.
On the Upper East Side, it's hard to know who to trust.
(Sighs) Usually, the answer is no one.
I'm sorry, but it's gonna take me more than a car ride to forget the fact that you slept with my mother.
Serena, I can't change what happened.
I can forget it, obviously, but I I can't change it.
Maybe you can forget, too? I don't know if I'll ever be able to forget this.
Well, I I guess I can try to move past it.
I mean, crazier things have happened in my family.
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, just not so fast.
There are certain images that keep popping up.
Then we must try to erase them.
(Sighs) I'm warning you.
This could take a while.
Mm-hmm.
(Chuckles) I never thought I'd see you again.
Care for a drink? I can't stay long, but I wanted to tell you that I looked into what your friend Blair told me.
Lady Alexander never went to any farm in Virginia.
Blair told you she did? No.
Bart told me.
But the horses he purchased from my family are nowhere to be found.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Bart obviously didn't care much about your horses and probably paid your father a lot of money for something else.
Do you know what it was? Maybe a a real estate deal? Perhaps a hotel? A hotel? No, my father was in the oil business.
But Bart couldn't have been involved in that.
Why not the oil business? Because we have a home in Dubai, but we're Sudanese nationals.
I'm sorry.
International affairs are not my area of expertise.
Well, at least not this kind.
Well, the U.
S.
has an embargo against trading oil with Sudan, so if that's what he bought from my father Bart was breaking federal law.
Thanks for taking another look at my loan application.
I (Scoffs) can't believe I left out all the revenue from the new markets.
Just a rookie mistake, I guess.
Well, the numbers do look better, and, uh, I'm glad you caught the error, because, uh, with ad sales projections like this we're happy to extend "The Spectator's" line of credit.
Thank you so much.
You're a lifesaver.
Now let me just go make you a copy of this real quick.
I'll be right back.
(Door opens) (Cell phone rings, beep) How did it go? Yeah, Nate asked me to take another look at the numbers like you said he would.
Are you sure you wanna co-sign on this loan? It's obvious he's doctored his earnings report.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
Send me the documents to sign in the morning.
(Beep) (Sighs) Again, I'm sorry I didn't tell you I was with Charles, and you felt the need to follow us.
Apparently (Clink) with good reason.
He's just trying to make things right with you.
I know how much you wanna believe that, but Charles has done nothing since we've gotten back together but lie and manipulate you.
Oh, really? You really think I'm that much of a pushover.
He will prey upon your maternal instincts to get between us.
Well, I won't let that happen.
Neither will I.
You know how much I don't like ultimatums, but I'm afraid Chuck has left me no choice.
If you wanna be with me, you need to stay away from my son.
(Gasps) You can't ask me to do that.
He's my son, too.
(Cell phone rings) We're not done discussing this.
So Bart was using the horses to hide the money he was buying illegal oil with? He had to hide it somehow.
Sudan is an embargoed country, which means he didn't fake his death because he was worried Mason Nevins would come after Lily or me.
He did it so he could avoid federal prison.
Well, this is what we need.
Right? Quick.
Call the CIA or the FBI or TMZ.
Let's turn him in! I wish it were that simple.
We need evidence first.
(Sighs) I was already planning our victory celebration in my head.
We were in a bubble bath with a bottle of Grande Cuve and no business in the way of us being together.
Hold onto that visual.
Mmm.
If I must.
Call me if you need anything.
(Beep) (Beep) Blair, it's Jean Pierre.
Your mother is not pleased.
She knows you're avoiding her calls and that you don't have orders from any buyers.
She says you have one month to fix this.
(Line disconnects) (Exhales deeply) Lily, I cannot apologize to you enough.
I mean, nothing like this will ever happen again in "The Spectator," I promise you.
Thank you for understanding, yeah.
Bye.
(Beep) I hope you're here because you forgive me, too.
I hope that answers your question.
If Serena can forgive my dad for sleeping with Lily, and Lily can forgive you for publishing a story about it, I guess I can forgive you for acting like a jerk.
(Scoffs) You know, I I haven't gone through those.
Are you sure you just wanna throw it all away? Some of it must have sentimental value.
Yeah, I'm sure, and I'm sorry I put the responsibility on you to begin with, but I was at the gallery, and I realized I don't want this stuff.
I I don't wanna look back.
I just wanna look forward With you.
(Stepdad's "Warrior" playing) We all have things from our past we'd like to erase.
(Sighs) Philip, get some popcorn.
I ran into Serena earlier today and picked up a movie for us.
But on the Upper East Side, it's not so easy to hit "delete.
" Step forward There's always a record of misdeed somewhere And someone's always looking for it.
(Elevator bell dings, doors open) Humphrey, what are you doing here? I'm pretty sure you have a spare room up in here.
I was wondering if I could crash.
You made it pretty clear you were done with me.
What's changed? I realized I made a mistake.
I've missed you.
I've missed my friend.
Last year, when you had no one, I was there for you.
I kinda need you to do the same for me right now.
Serena's bed is empty.
Make yourself at home.
Will heal Better not to ignore the past but learn from it instead.
Nor the sword Otherwise, history has a way of repeating itself.

, Gossip Girl.
Gossip girl here-- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
"Gossip girl" says your dad is dating Serena Van Der Woodsen.
Is it true? Not for long.
This isn't fashion-forward or provocative.
It's exploitation, and it's embarrassing.
Nelly Yuki trashed me in "Women's wear daily.
" "Can Blair Waldorf step into her mother's shoes, or is her achilles' heel of the stripper variety.
" It's Jean Pierre.
Your mother knows you don't have orders from any buyers.
Did this really happen-- you and Serena? Every dirty detail.
Did you write about that night that we were together at the Campbell apartment? Relax.
I didn't publish any of that.
Last year, when you had no one, I was there for you.
I kinda need you to do the same for me right now.
Make yourself at home.
When it comes to Ivy, you're way out of line.
She's a known con artist.
She swindled lily and her entire family.
You need to stop sticking your nose in where it doesn't belong.
He didn't fake his death for Lily or me.
He did it so he could avoid federal prison.
New day, new debs All dressed up to enter high society.
But one fashion faux pas, and the dressing down will last a lifetime.
Why are you still chewing? Tell me what you think.
I think, um, it's old school, not in the good way.
In the--in the literal way, like what old ladies used to wear to school.
Well, it's traditional, as am I.
I need to remind the world that I am not the hypersexual heathen Nelly Yuki labeled me.
There's traditional, and there's missionary, which does not work for the dress Or you, as I recall.
Being polite does not make me a prude.
So why fight your raunchy reputation? Shock value is what got my "Inside Out" serial attention.
Well, my audience was titillated when Sage stripped down to her skivvies.
Go.
Get out of here with your high neckline and low hemline.
Go! I have a new vision, and I need a new Muse.
And I suggest you replace your Muse.
Don't let her touch anything.
Do you know how many hours I've spent searching for you? I hate it when you play hard-to-get.
Are the pancakes okay? You can tell me if you don't like my cooking.
No, your-- your cooking's great.
I just forgot they were there.
Uh, like me? You've barely said a word to me all week.
Sorry.
I love them-- you and the pancakes.
I'm getting my cotillion dress refitted.
I lost weight without even trying.
Oh, you're-- you're coming out tonight? No one calls it that anymore.
Well, it's still exciting.
Let me know if you need help with your presentation speech or--or any of the dance steps.
My cotillion ended up being one of the best nights of my life, And I'm sure yours will be, too.
All this gushing-- it seems like someone's angling for an invitation.
No, I don't expect to be invited.
Cotillion is for a girl and her family.
It is.
Uh, but no.
Not just family.
I mean not family in the strictest legal sense.
I-I meant to invite you.
It must have just slipped my mind.
So much for being the only teenager on my father's arm tonight.
I'm sorry.
I'd love for you to be there tonight if it's not too late.
It's never too late for cotillion.
Good, then I'll see you there.
Staying in this room is transforming you into its previous occupant-- a diva who ignores my calls and has no work ethic.
Come on.
You know that second part is not true.
What do you want? I've come to wrestle the Blair chapter from your hot little hands.
I haven't finished it yet.
You're lying.
You're here in some desperate attempt to regain Blair's love, but you know when she reads what you wrote about her, she's gonna hate you forever.
Listen, I can't hold the magazine off any longer.
Hand it over.
What language do I need to say it in for you to understand? It's not done.
I speak five, and in every one, that sentence translates to "bullcrap.
" You have until noon to turn it in.
Do you know where Miss Blair went? Uh, she forgot to put on lucky charm this morning when she get out of shower.
She think conditioner dulls diamond.
That lucky charm looks a lot like an engagement ring.
No, uh Is engagement ring on necklace.
At least until Mr.
Chuck defeats bad dad.
Miss Blair never leave home without it.
I need to prepare for mad mood.
Hi.
Uh, this is Dan Humphrey.
Yeah.
Yeah, you can send a messenger to pick up my next chapter.
No, it's not about Blair Waldorf.
The one I'm sending is about Chuck Bass.
Well, Nate won't publish any more stories about Lily in "The Spectator.
" Well, I'd give them to Gossip Girl if I had them, but Rufus burned my stash of secrets.
But don't worry.
I'll find something.
We'll leave her with no one.
So why do we even pay the instructors? I'll call you later.
What's wrong? I need to meet the contractor at the gallery.
He called and said a pipe burst and now the floors are ruined.
Well, hopefully he's exaggerating.
Contractors are always looking for ways to make more money.
Well, I don't have any more.
It's all in the gallery.
And I can't open without floors.
You wanna come? I would, but I have an appointment uptown.
Okay.
Shouldn't you be with the FBI, having Bart arrested for illegal oil trading? They need evidence first.
the Sheikh was the only guy who had any, and he's loyal to his dad.
Bart's been too careful to leave any trace of the transactions on the books.
I mean, it's pretty easy to fake numbers.
You speaking from personal experience? I'm referring to your father.
Right.
I mean, he got caught, but a lot of people do a little creative accounting to get past a rough patch and never do.
I'm sure every hedge fund manager behind bars is telling himself the same thing.
All I'm saying is that Bart had to keep track of his finances somewhere.
If it wasn't in his business accounts, it was in his personal ones.
You're right.
And hopefully, with Lily's help, we'll be able to get them.
Did you instigate a formal dress code at "The Spectator"? I gotta drop it off at the cleaners before I take Sage to cotillion tonight.
Right.
I hope your third time coming out is finally a charm.
Serena.
Hey,Chuck.
Bye, Chuck.
No, just go ahead and help yourself.
Don't even mention what you're doing here or, you know I need a male's perspective on Steven.
He's barely spoken to me all week, and then I don't even think he was gonna tell me about cotillion until Sage accidentally mentioned it.
I Has she said anything? Her dad doesn't normally come up in most of our conversations.
Could the weirdness be that Steven hooked up with your mom in a dungeon when you were in grade school? No.
Once he actually remembered that that happened, It wasn't weird at all.
He got over it really quickly.
The awkwardness started after.
And I don't--I don't know how I'm supposed to fix the problem if I don't even know what the problem is.
See, this is where my female advice skills fall short.
Most of my exes would just steal my phone or go through all my e-mails.
That was a joke.
I know.
Lily.
There you are.
Charles, what are you doing here? Bart left specific instructions with Vanya not to let me into the apartment, But he did let slip that you were shopping on Madison.
I should get home.
Lily, please, I need your help.
Last time I tried to help you, you manipulated me against your father.
Bart asked me not to speak with you until you stop attacking our relationship.
You could get me the proof.
Don't you wanna know the real reason he faked his death? Look, I'm sorry, Charles.
I hope you make peace with your father soon so we can be a family again.
Maybe I can help instead.
Did someone order a wedding cake? If you're talking about my dress, Tom used vintage lace from Paris.
Vintage as in "old" and "used" Lucky for you, I have the hottest new line to save your sartorial debut.
Why would you want me anywhere near your clothes after I left them on the runway at your fashion show? Like it or not, your stunt branded me a provocateur, so I'm embracing it.
The words I read were "distasteful" and "majorly sluttish.
" Semantics.
Now I know you love to make a statement, so drop the prom poof and let's go.
No, thanks.
I make a statement in whatever I wear, and tonight, it won't be Waldorf.
Serena? What are you doing? I just needed to write some e-mails, so I was gonna borrow your dad's computer, but then I decided that I should use mine from home.
Must be some pretty thrilling correspondence.
No.
No, I am just so excited for you and your cotillion tonight.
I'll see you there.
They say a diamond is forever, or maybe never.
It just depends on who finds it first.
Why would I want the help of a con artist and a probable sociopath? I'm neither of those things, and even if I were, we have a mutual interest in this case.
What are your interests specifically? To get Lily to leave me alone.
May I suggest you stop following her around in cabs? I was trying to find dirt.
I figured, you know, if I caused trouble in her relationship, she'd stay out of mine.
While I can't deny my desire for marital discord, I won't hurt Lily.
You don't have to.
All you have to do to get your daddy's panties in a bunch is talk to her.
And as you just witnessed, she doesn't want to talk to me.
Bart doesn't know that.
So what, make it seem like we've been communicating? Plant some evidence at the apartment? It might work, except Bart has banned me from the building.
I wasn't banned.
And I saved a key card.
Please tell me this is an inappropriate gift for my debut and not an engagement ring for Serena.
A gift? No, it is not.
Dad, stop talking like Yoda.
It's an engagement ring.
God, it's a relief to talk about it.
I've been so nervous, I forgot to invite Serena to cotillion.
Yeah, maybe you were nervous because she's way too young, and it's way too soon.
I get it feels fast, but we spent all summer together, and I haven't loved anyone this much since your mother.
We all know how well that turned out.
I'm scared, too, but I want Serena to know that I'm in this for the long haul And I'm not cool with her moving in here with you until we are engaged.
And now that you know, I'm just gonna get Lily's permission and propose to Serena tonight.
Screw Lily.
I'm not giving my permission.
I'm not asking.
Hush, jessica.
Social ascension is a painful process.
Well I mean, I know I look young, but do you really think I pass for 16? No.
I'll have Dorota find a dermatologist with some juvederm, stat.
Hey, I was in the neighborhood.
I thought you might, uh, enjoy some coffee.
Maybe I'd be more believable if Dan was my date.
No real deb would ever be caught dead with an escort from an outer borough.
Dominick Dunne was from Hartford, and he was considered high society.
Your Chuck chapter is my favorite.
Thank you.
What, you put out a Chuck chapter? After I gave you your first decent place to live? Go.
Pack your things.
Don't you want to read it before you kick me out? I read Nate's chapter, and you were supposed to be his friend.
You hate Chuck and everything to do with me in relation to Chuck.
That's not true.
Yeah, don't worry, Blair.
You're not even in it.
What? That's impossible.
There is no Chuck Bass chapter without Blair Waldorf.
There is, while he focuses on his battle with his father, which is what the chapter's about.
Dan made him seem like a superhero single-mindedly fighting evil.
Ask Chuck if he's upset about it when he picks you up for cotillion.
Chuck's not going to cotillion.
Oh.
Oh, that's right.
That's right.
I'm sorry.
I forgot you two can't be together until he achieves his goal.
And I achieve mine, which you are distracting me from.
Bye, Jessica.
Okay, bye.
Thanks for coming over, darling.
I thought you still might be upset about my brief dalliance with Steven.
Oh, well, I definitely wish it never happened, but I think if he can forget about it, then we should all try, too.
Especially since, um, I think he might propose to me soon.
Oh, I had a feeling.
You know, he called me earlier and said he wanted to meet before cotillion.
He said he had something important to ask me.
Oh, my gosh! He really is doing it.
Are--are you sure this is what you want? I mean, I never really thought about it, but once I saw that ring, I-I literally got butterflies.
Well, diamonds seem to have that effect, but you're just-- you're still so young and I know, but Steven's not.
He--he's an adult, and he treats me like one.
And, you know, this is the first honest, healthy relationship I've ever had.
It just doesn't seem that long ago that you were in love with Dan.
And now that Rufus and I aren't together, well, I thought you two might be.
Yeah, well, I-I thought that for a little while, too.
But, you know, then Dan and I had that huge falling out, and I met steven.
Mom, you're gonna say "Yes," right? Oh, lord knows it doesn't matter what I say.
You're gonna do exactly what you wanna do.
Oh, thank you.
I should probably go get a manicure so that my hands look perfect.
Absolutely.
I'll see you at cotillion.
Pull it tighter.
We need the illusion of a youthful jawline.
Good luck with the old chick.
In some countries, old people are considered beautiful.
Mm, not this one.
Shouldn't you be at the Waldorf Astoria, donning that doily dress? I just found out my father's proposing to Serena tonight.
That is so exciting! We'll all get to be there to witness it.
Yes, and be upstaged.
I thought you'd want to stop that from happening, in exchange for me wearing your dress, of course.
Well, you consider yourself a master manipulator.
Why not squash the proposal yourself? Come on, Blair.
We all know from "Gossip girl" there's no one better at taking down Serena than you.
That is true, but I would need a 2-tiered plan, some kind of protection.
Your generation can't be trusted with scheming on good faith.
I promise I'll behave.
Just please stop her from marrying my dad.
Okay.
Fine.
I will delay the proposal for tonight, and if you keep your promise and I get my buyers, then we can discuss ending their engagement plans for good.
Oh, do we get to climb fire escapes and wear stockings on our heads for that part? Yes, Jessica.
Go get outfitted and--and wait for my signal.
Okay, great.
Okay.
She's not actually gonna be wearing.
No.
No.
She was just annoying me.
Hey! Bring in the dress! It needs to be refitted.
I sprayed your cologne, and I put a copy of Bart's will you gave me on Lily's desk.
He'll be furious with her if he thinks we're conspiring to reclaim his empire.
Now fill a glass with scotch.
Now drink it.
I wouldn't leave a drop.
Hello? Who the hell are you? Blair, what a nice surprise.
Hello, Lily.
I wish I could say the same about Serena's impending proposal.
Has she discussed it with you? Oh, she has.
She seems thrilled.
Need I say more? Serena's enthusiasm is like the bat signal for bad ideas.
It's sudden, I know, but she does seem happy.
But doesn't she always when she's with a new guy? Dan, Nate, Colin, Ben.
Oh, she is a romantic, bless her tender heart.
But, Lily, you and I are realists.
We need to look after her because she isn't capable of looking after herself.
Thank you, Blair.
I appreciate your input.
Bye.
Lily.
Thanks for coming to meet me.
I know it's old-fashioned, but with our history and Serena's father not being a constant-- You want my permission to marry my daughter.
Mission accomplished.
How do you know you convinced her? All I have to do is subtly suggest Serena needs saving, and Lily jumps into protective mother mode, ready to do anything to shield her precious daughter from another relationship gone wrong.
She even had one guy sent to prison.
Well, my dad better not end up in lock up, but I hope you're right about the rest.
I am, and just in case, we have your part of the plan as backup.
Everything's in motion.
You can either tell me who you are or you can tell the police.
No, please, no police.
My mother Larissa just sent me over to clean something for Mrs.
Lily.
She's sick, but Mrs.
Lily called and said it was an emergency.
And, uh, that's what needed cleaning? Mrs.
Lily said no one else was supposed to see.
"Mrs.
Lily" doesn't pay your mother's salary.
I do.
Chuck.
That'll be all.
Wow.
You look beautiful.
You're quite the dapper Dan yourself.
Unfortunately, Jessica's off somewhere with pantyhose on her head, so she no longer requires an escort.
I'm--I'm not gonna ask, but I'm not dressed for Jessica.
I know Chuck's busy, and no one should go to cotillion alone.
Well, I suppose I could overlook your upbringing now that you're a regular feature in "Vanity Fair" Spotted-- one man leaving Harry Winston empty-handed.
Steven Spence walked in with a ring and left without one.
I wonder what--or who-- he's returning.
Where's the Blair chapter? Why do you care? Chuck just posted, and the next chapter's not due for a week.
Maybe to "Vanity Fair," but I want it now.
I know you, Humphrey.
I'm not gonna let you turn our scathing expose into a sentimental sonnet because of your delusional feelings for Blair.
Why are you so sure that I'm delusional and not determined? She did date me.
Briefly, after she lost her prince and her mind.
And now she wears that adorable engagement ring from Chuck around her neck.
Not on her finger.
That shoulder, arm, and torso space is my window to win her back.
Now if you'll excuse me.
Not so fast.
Either lose the romance notions, Or I'll lose them for you.
Where did you get that? Hmm.
Serena's phone.
Looks like you two share a nostalgia for long-lost loves.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
I bet she still uses it to get off.
I know I do.
You can't show that to Blair.
Unless you want Blair to hate you forever for screwing her best friend while you two were still together, You'll get me those pages.
I'm doing this for your own good.
There's no viagra to save a career that's gone soft.
Okay, just give me until midnight.
Only because I love "Cinderfella.
" Oh! Oh! I'm so sorry! Sorry.
Why did I ask a peasant's advice on how to dress royalty? Your shock and amaze plan had better work.
I'm counting on it.
You came.
Blair, you look devastating, as always.
And, Humphrey, I see you immortalized me once again in print.
Should I be concerned about your level of obsession? Not at all.
I find your battle with your father inspiring.
It's the stuff myths are made of, like Zeus and Cronus.
It never ends.
Until Zeus wins and comes to be with Hera.
Actually, Zeus tricked Hera into being with him after he raped her.
Enough about the gods.
Let's drink.
I'm sorry, Blair.
I can't.
I'm here to speak with Lily.
I'm betting Bart will come, too, to confront her.
I'm hoping after that she'll join my battle against him.
Have you seen her? No, but go find her and imprison Cronus.
The sooner the better.
Go find us a prime viewing spot.
I need to speak with Sage.
Thank you.
Serena! You look lovely.
Did you deny Steven permission to propose to me? Well, I wouldn't exactly phrase it that way.
I did express concern that you might not be ready for marriage.
Oh, how would you know? Were you ready all six times you did it? Look, I'm sorry that you're upset, Serena, but I'm not the only one that had misgivings.
I mean, Blair called and shared hers as well.
Blair has no right to share anything.
We're not even friends anymore.
You knew how much I wanted this.
I knew you wanted someone, but let's face it, Serena.
You don't have boyfriends.
You have life rafts.
That you keep taking from me and--and leaving me to drown.
First you got together with Rufus so that I could never be with Dan, and now you're jealous that some man that doesn't remember sleeping with you is in love with me.
I'm not gonna let you ruin this.
Girls, I need your personal statements.
Bunny Raburn, I hope you included your ballet photos.
Ask my mom.
She made it.
Thank you, Sage.
Congratulations on your academic accolades.
Which clearly have nothing to do with intelligence.
Why is Serena here? I told you to keep her away.
I did what you said.
I used my dad's phone to uninvite her, and I had him take the ring my mom sent me to get resized.
And I had my minions send a picture to "Gossip girl.
" Your plan just sucked.
My plan does not suck.
We'll just have to come up with a new one.
I already have.
Don't worry.
I'll be shocking in your dress, and Serena will never be my evil stepmom.
Now I have to find my date.
Bart.
What a nice surprise.
I wasn't expecting you.
Just like you weren't expecting me to find out about your secret meeting with Chuck? Ah.
I knew you'd be upset.
You know, he tracked me down while I was shopping.
So you invited him back to our apartment to go through my will? I have no idea what you're referring to.
Charles was not in our apartment.
I told him I wasn't comfortable speaking with him until he made things right.
Stop lying to me, Lily.
I caught Larissa's daughter cleaning up after you.
Bart, Larissa's daughter is 4.
Then who was the with Chuck's scotch glass? Ah.
Let me guess.
Ivy.
She's the same one that leaked those nasty rumors about me last week.
Charles, how could you.
After everything I've done to try to make peace? I don't want peace.
I want you to help me make him pay for what he did.
Put a silver spoon in your mouth? Or raise you as a single parent? Which one do you want to punish me for first, son? Lily, you have to trust me.
You are aiding and abetting a criminal.
Charles, that's enough.
Do you want to end up like Ruth Madoff, losing your son to defend your husband? I don't want to lose anyone, Charles, But you're leaving me no choice.
I'm going to get my coat.
What can I say? Marriage has its privileges.
I'd like to welcome you all to the dispensary cotillion and debutante ball.
Our first debutante is Jillian Fremont.
Jillian is the daughter of Winston and Steven.
Sorry.
Serena! There you are.
Whatever it is, Blair, I don't have time.
I have to try to stop you and my mom from destroying my proposal.
Not destroy, just delay long enough for Sage to wear my dress.
She really doesn't want you as a stepmom.
And I only have a month to win back buyers after you walked out of my fashion show.
Oh, so you get to ruin my future to sell dresses? Yeah, that's justified.
What difference does it make if your engagement comes a few days late, after I have Waldorf designs back on track? Don't you get it? It's not coming.
Whatever you did made Steven return the ring.
You mean that picture on "Gossip girl.
" Sage's mom sent her a ring as a gift.
He was at Harry Winston getting it resized.
This was all part of a very well-thought out plan.
It was? Yes.
He still has the ring because he still wants to marry you.
Do you really think so? Of course.
Have you ever met yourself? Any man who loves Serena van der Woodsen would never let Lily or anyone else tell him not to be with her.
You know, when I saw that ring, you were the only person I wanted to talk to about it.
Well, I would never try to take away your happiness.
Well, at least not permanently.
If you love him and it's meant to be, then I want it, too.
Unfortunately, kids today are not like we were.
They're unpredictable and alliance-free.
There is no line they won't cross.
You know, I thought Sage was really starting to like me.
Well, you were wrong, and now she's gone rogue.
She's come up with a plan of her own that I am scared is more dastardly than even I can imagine.
You have to warn Steven.
I will, right after I tell him I love him and that I want to marry him.
Thank you, B.
Now go.
I wanna be a bridesmaid.
Our next debutante is Bunny Raburn.
Bunny is the daughter of Jim and Fran Raburn.
Ticktock.
She's escorted by Tom Grand.
Bunny began to dance as a toddler Hey.
How you feeling? Like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.
Hey.
Oh, there you are.
I'm glad you made it.
So I-I take it you didn't uninvite me either? Of course not.
What are you talking about? Well, I know about the engagement ring, and I don't care about my mom's permission.
Neither do I.
Our next debutante is Sage Spence.
You ready for this? I can hardly wait.
Sage is the daughter of Paulette and Steven Spence.
She's escorted by Nathaniel Archibald.
I always knew you could do dirty.
Provocative.
We do make a good team.
Her love of horseback riding started on the central park carousel What are you doing? Help me! Ed, black it out! Can we please turn off the screen? No! No! Stop that! That's weird.
Your camera's on.
Uh, no, no, it's not.
Whoa, I think it was recording us, actually.
Oh, gosh.
Maybe I-I Blair, I can explain this.
You manipulated me into thinking that it was over so I would cheat on her.
I said I'd never mention S again.
But what's a movie without credits? Why don't we start the dancing early, huh? Dancing.
Dancing would be good.
Sage did this.
She told Blair she had a plan.
What, the same Blair who put her in a fashion show half-naked? No, Sage did that, too.
You cannot let her sabotage our relationship.
Excuse me if I don't take parenting advice from a woman who recorded herself having s*x with her ex to get revenge on her best friend.
I know that that was wrong.
I was in a really bad place, which is why I left town in the first place-- to get a fresh start, which I had with you.
This doesn't change us.
It changes everything.
So the whole time you refused to speak to me for choosing Chuck, you were cheating on me with Serena.
It was only once.
And you--you heard the tape.
She manipulated me into it.
In order to claim date rape, you have to say "No.
" Look, she told me you chose Chuck, which turns out wasn't even a lie.
You just didn't have the decency to tell me yourself.
I intended to, but I respected you enough not to sleep with him until I did.
I thought Chuck sleeping with Jenny was the most despicable thing someone could do to me.
But this is worse, because you pretended to be better.
At least I ended up with the right person.
You ended up with no one.
Chuck will never be finished fighting with his father, and that ring around your neck is never gonna be on your finger.
I would rather be with no one than with you.
What the hell happened to waiting until midnight? I was going to.
That little bitch Sage stole my phone.
W-what did I-- what did I ever do to her? Well, from what I've heard over debs hurling in the bathroom, she wanted to stop her daddy from marrying Serena.
The surprise ending for your serial was just collateral damage.
Well, you still got what you wanted.
Blair hates me forever.
I'm gonna go get the next chapter.
Bring it to me here.
Hmm.
I forgot how much I love being 16.
Tell me this isn't your best cotillion ever.
Oh, are you kidding me? This is worse than when I punched Carter Baizen.
Excuse me, mini me.
My phone? Oh.
Is this yours? Hmm.
Skip the innocent act.
I admire your way with an antic.
If you're ever in the need of employment, call me.
Wait.
You broadcast the s*x tape? Would you want your father to marry Serena? She's my friend.
You humiliated her.
I didn't force her to do it for the camera.
I simply reported it, like you did with my dad and Lily on "The Spectator.
" That's a newspaper, not a society gala.
And I didn't do it to hurt them.
You know what? You may be legal, but this is way too high school for me.
Nate! Nate, where are you going? We were in the middle of a dance! Ah, that's great.
As long as they're done for the opening.
Thanks.
That sounded positive.
Are the floors okay? They were destroyed, but Bex told an anonymous collector about the Cole James piece, which means now we have the money to replace them.
Well, I knew everything would work out.
I'm gonna go clean up so we can celebrate.
And say "Thanks" To Bex for me, too.
Hi.
Bex, I know you're not allowed to tell me who bought the piece, Uh, but, uh, I'd like to send them an invitation and, uh, a thank-you note.
A.
P.
O.
Box would be great.
Wait.
Are you s-- are you sure it's 76648? Yep, that's all I needed.
Thanks.
I guess we learned what appalling thing Sage had planned.
Sage? You're the one who's appalling, and a lot of other words that I should not utter at a society gala.
Blair, I-I know that that video was horrible, but you had already chosen Chuck.
Did you know that when you took Dan to the Campbell apartment and set up a camera to seduce him for the whole world to see? No, it wasn't like that.
A waitress had spilled on us, and--and--and so we went to clean up.
I don't believe you.
You took Nate's virginity on that bar, when I loved him.
You just needed to prove that you could still take anyone I want.
The only one you want is Chuck.
I am so sorry, Blair.
I made a mistake, but so did you when you teamed up with Sage to try to ruin my proposal.
No.
I stopped when I knew that you could really get hurt, but you didn't.
You crossed the line and kept going.
Only because I thought I loved Dan, and you didn't.
You know, Serena, I kept hoping that this was just like all of our other fights, and that no matter how much we hated each other, we would still always be best friends.
But you were right, what you said before my fashion show.
We haven't been friends for a long time.
I just couldn't see it.
We all came into this world naked and alone.
Looks like S is leaving it that way, too.
What are you doing? You know, going through someone's mail is a federal offense.
As is purchasing artwork with stolen funds.
You wanna explain the bank account with all the zeroes? Okay.
I didn't steal it.
Lola returned it to me.
That's Carol's portion of Cece's estate.
That makes sense.
What doesn't is why you came to me pretending to have nothing, when you could buy half of Manhattan.
That money alienated me from everyone I cared about.
But I couldn't do nothing while you lost the gallery.
Yeah, but you still should've told me.
I'm sorry, but my being rich doesn't change anything between us.
Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.
Money caused all my problems with Lily.
I'd never lord my fortune over your head the way she did.
I mean, this money just means we can be us and fix broken floors and go on great trips and celebrate with fabulous champagne.
I never thought I'd be grateful to CeCe Rhodes.
Hey, Steven, it's me.
Can we meet somewhere to talk, please? Serena, I have nothing more to say to you.
So that's it? You're just gonna break up with me over Sage's manipulation? She was right.
We moved too fast, and you are too young.
No, but that's not what you said this summer.
You said that we were perfect together.
We were, until we got back to your life in New York.
But I didn't want this life.
That's why I ran away.
It's still a part of you, and my loving you isn't enough to shut it out.
And I can't marry someone who always has another s*x tape or hidden agenda or surprise scheme up their sleeve.
I'm a father.
I can't just think about myself.
Steven I'm sorry, Serena, more than you know.
You take care of yourself.
Are you okay? Not really.
Are you? I'm not sure.
You, uh, you wanna grab a burger? And fries.
And a shake.
Yeah.
Why not? Okay.
Blair.
Thank you for never sleeping with Serena.
The pleasure was all mine.
Her sick show with Dan is all over "Gossip girl.
" Well, at least now everyone can see the truth about them.
They can see everything about them.
But I have to say, I didn't expect this from Humphrey.
And though I always wanted you to choose me, I always feared he was the better man.
No one's better for me than you.
Then you won't mind waiting a little longer for us to be together? Your plan to have Lily help you didn't work? My father has her wrapped around his finger.
I have to find a way to expose him on my own.
You will.
And I will wait as long as it takes.
If that's what you still want-- to wait.
They say good things come to those who do.
Was that you vibrating? I should go.
I know it seems like forever, but I know what my father did, and I just have to prove it.
When Charles said I was aiding and abetting, Bart, have you done something that would send you to prison? I never told you to protect you from exactly these kinds of attacks.
After the mortgage meltdown, Bass industries was in trouble.
I knew some people who knew some people, and I made a deal to sell some oil from the Sudan.
There was an embargo in place which made it illegal, and then things got complicated.
Was anyone hurt? No.
Well, that's all I needed to know.
There's something to be said for having a partner in crime.
Did your dad dump the bitch yet? No.
But I wondered if you'd seen Bart do anything unusual in the apartment.
Maybe the reason he's so intent on keeping me out is because what I need's inside.
Mm.
Well, he did hold on to this envelope the whole time, but I didn't see who it was from.
Sorry.
No.
You've been very helpful.
Thank you.
Sometimes you have no choice but to go it alone.
You know I hate cryptic text messages.
I need to emotionally prepare for a gift or a land mine.
I have both.
Well, gift first so I can appreciate it before I'm blown to smithereens.
Jean Pierre call to get pattern for Sage s*x dress.
He say he already has calls from buyers.
Well, then that means that Waldorf designs will be in stores before my mother's deadline.
What could possibly explode that? Miss Eleanor call, too.
She saw photos of cotillion.
She say she come home to fix decorum disaster.
After all, you're the only one who can answer for your sins.
Well, come on, do you think that my mom's right, that Steven was just another in my long line of life rafts? I don't know.
Do you feel like you're drowning without him? We probably both need to learn how to swim.
Oh, come on.
How is that fair? I get dumped over our s*x tape, and you get girls? What can I say? They like what they saw.
Well, they didn't see your plaid boxers, clearly.
Hey, those are my favorites.
I remember, from four years ago.
You want more pie? Hey, excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt.
Uh, could we get some more-- What do you want, pecan or apple crisp? Both.
And banana cream? Thank you.
Hey, thanks for being humiliated with me.
Once you've answered for your sins, there's nothing in the way of starting a whole new partnership.
X.
O.

, Gossip Girl.
so I would cheat on her, and I can't marry someone who always has another s*x tape or surprise scheme up their sleeve.
You wanna grab a burger? So Bart was using the horses to hide the money he was buying illegal oil with? He did it so he could avoid federal prison.
Lola returned it to me.
That's Carol's portion of Cece's estate.
I never thought I'd be grateful to Cece Rhodes.
Miss Eleanor call.
She saw photos of cotillion.
She say she come home to fix decorum disaster.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.O.X.O., Gossip Girl.
They say the early bird gets the worm.
Inspiring motivation if you're the bird.
The worm, however, has no idea when her future will be plucked away by the next airborne attacker.
My mother's plane landed 45 minutes ago.
Look, alive, people! She was so furious that my cotillion dress was associated with Serena's sickening s*x tape.
Everything must be perfect.
And "perfect" does not include tabloid contraband.
Hand it over.
Get this out of my sight.
My mother cannot see that revenge smut.
On second thought, you go with it.
How dare Humphrey write that I am conniving, manipulative, and stuck in high school? I am not all scheme and no substance.
Hell have no fury like a lonely boy scorned.
Well, he doesn't matter.
When my mother sees the dress orders, she will be so busy singing my praises that she won't have time to pay attention to Pay attention to what, Blair? What don't you want me paying attention to? Mother! Welcome home! What is this, "Downton Abbey"? Everyone, back to work! Dorota, when did you become a seamstress? Get my bags, take them back to the house and start keeping it.
This is not fooling anyone.
You.
Office.
Now.
I know you're upset, mother, but my cotillion dress has already been ordered by the three B's Barneys, Bergdorf's, and the lesser but still relevant Bloomingdale's.
I achieved your goal.
At the cost of my company's reputation.
A few sales do not make up for a runway strip show and s*x tapes, and bandage dresses without the the bandages.
Well, I admit a shift in marketing strategy may be called for.
No, the the issue goes deeper than that, Blair.
It's you.
You and your your split personality.
Well, you must be referring to my ability to multitask.
I am referring to your dark and scheming and, frankly, sexually inappropriate side.
I like to think of myself as open-minded? For as long as I can remember, you have struggled between your two natures.
I know that you are a beautiful, intelligent, ambitious young businesswoman.
But if you want to continue to run my multimillion-dollar corporation, the deviant half has to go.
For good! I understand.
There won't be an issue.
My Grace Kelly can defeat my Grace Jones, no problem.
Uh-huh.
Well, honestly, I've I've slept so much better since you found out that Lola returned the money from Cece's estate to me.
I'm really sorry I kept that a secret from you.
I'm just glad everything's out in the open and you had the money to save the gallery in time for tonight's opening.
I'm so excited it's finally happening.
Are there any last-minute details you want me to take care of? Well, we need to give the caterer a final head count.
Do you remember how many R.
S.
V.
Ps we had? I never checked, but I'm sure everyone's coming.
Uh What's wrong? Well, this can't be right.
They're all regrets.
What happened to your art world connections? No "Art Forum" editor.
No major collectors.
Hey, even Bex said "no.
" What the hell happened? You surfing the Empire CCTV again? What, is Olivia Munn staying here? Wrong place.
This is the security footage from the Van Der Woodsen building.
How'd you get your hands on that? Well, Vanya can't be bribed, but the night doorman was remarkably open to a cash payment.
So what are you looking for? When Ivy was in the apartment, she said Bart walked in with an envelope he held on to rather tightly.
I was hoping to see a return address or some distinguishing marks.
Did you find anything? Indeed.
The envelope had the seal of the first international bank of Sudan.
The financial records from his illegal oil trade? I assume so, but Bart closed all the accounts that morning.
And he's not about to show you what's in the envelope or tell you where it is.
He won't, but someone else might.
Bruce Caplan dropped the envelope off to Bart that morning.
The Bass business manager? He won't spill any of Bart's secrets to you.
He won't, but if the head of "The Spectator" were to ask for business management advice He might accidentally let something slip.
Especially if it's the kind of meeting that loosens lips.
Okay.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Well, I figured out why no one's coming to our opening.
Turns out there's a huge benefit tonight at the Conrad for the art production fund.
Guess who's hosting.
Lily.
She must've figured out when you were planning on opening your gallery, scheduled her own benefit to sabotage you.
Well, it's not just me she's sabotaging.
It's my artists, too.
This group show was a big deal to them.
How am I gonna explain that no one's coming because of my vindictive ex-wife? Well, everyone would still come if her event was canceled.
Oh, she's not gonna cancel a huge benefit for me.
She won't even take my call.
I'm not calling her.
I'm calling the art production fund.
I feel like donating some money.
Good morning, Daniel.
Good morning.
Thank you for letting me stay in Eric's room.
Can I make you and Bart a cup? Oh, no.
I'm good, thanks.
And Bart is out of town.
I'm on my way to Via Quadronno to meet the girls before my benefit meeting.
How's that going, by the way? I forgot how much I enjoy throwing a party without having my husband standing over my shoulder, judging me.
I mean Rufus, of course, not Bart.
Forgive me, Daniel.
You can never offend me with the truth.
Nonfat cappuccino, extra foam, no sugar.
You remembered.
Yeah, well, it's been a while, almost as long as since we woke up in the same apartment together.
Unless you count the Waldorfs'.
Remember? I certainly forgot this was coming out today.
Yeah.
We've both burned a lot of bridges this year.
But at least we have each other.
And I couldn't be more grateful for you letting me camp out, but I I don't want to overstay my welcome.
I finally got my first paycheck for "Vanity Fair," so I think it's time for me to find my own place and let you get back to your life.
Yeah.
I mean, we can't hide out here forever.
But, hey, if you if you need to find a new place, I I know someone who knows everyone, who has terrific instincts for real estate, and who happens to have an afternoon free to look at apartments with you.
Who? Oh.
Right.
Yeah, that's you.
Okay.
So do you have any idea what neighborhood you want? I can't get far enough away from my dad right now, so Brooklyn's out.
So Upper East Side? I was I was thinking lower.
What's funny about that? Oh, I know you like the idea of saying you live in an L.
E.
S.
walk-up, but we both know you well enough to know you secretly long for a condo in the West Village.
Fine.
A doorman would be nice, but I'll just lie about how much rent I pay.
Okay, let's take a cab to West Fourth then.
No, we got a ride.
You bought a Vespa? That's right.
I forgot how much you like Vespas.
But I got so used to driving one around Italy this summer that I decided I couldn't live without.
Here.
Hop on.
Serena! Serena! Hey, I loved that s*x tape! Serena, Serena, over here! No.
Turn around and give me a smile, Serena.
When's the sequel? Talk to us.
Spotted S.
and D.
getting cozy again.
Even I have to admit they sure look cute on that scooter.
Oh, my gosh.
That was amazing! You were you were like Jason Bourne, riding up on the sidewalk.
You know, that s*x tape I knew it went viral, but I didn't expect that.
Well, given the media circus, maybe today's not the day to be searching for apartments.
Nobody wants a tenant trailed by TMZ.
That's great.
All right, we should probably get off the streets.
Yeah.
I could use a drink.
You know what? I know a place where no one will think to look for us.
Perfect.
Thank you.
So, Bruce, is there anything else I can get you? Wow.
Crystal and Cristal is my favorite combination.
But maybe we'd better get to that urgent business matter you mentioned.
Well, there are certain things about "The Spectator" finances I would like to remain confidential.
I wonder if you could advise me on the safest way to keep those hidden.
Storing confidential information is a specialty of mine.
But I like to work on a client-by-client basis.
Could you give me some examples? I'm sorry.
Uh, my clients depend on my discretion.
Besides, I don't want to talk about that now.
Send me your books.
I'll make a recommendation.
In the meantime, I would like to take the rest of this meeting elsewhere.
Don't forget your jacket.
Oh.
Thanks.
Why did you let him leave without getting the information? He wasn't gonna give it to me, so I figured I'd just take it.
I will admit you have taken steps.
Like the the peonies were an elegant addition to the handwritten apologies you sent to each of the board members of the cotillion.
And poppy did seem touched by my donation to her charity for children who can't smile.
Sound like Miss Blair show great grace and dignity.
Yes, that's right, Dorota.
My mother has shown me the errors of my way.
So now you can return to Paris, reassured that your company's on the straight and narrow.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
I said steps, as in the first of many on the road to recovery.
Well, I have already admitted that I am powerless over my scheming, and that my life has become unmanageable.
What else is there? Amends to the fashion community which informs the masses.
Hello, Blair.
I had Dorota prepare a light lunch.
I'll let you girls chat.
How could someone who hides everything for everyone else pick his birthday for his password? I underestimated you, Nathaniel.
Well, you're not the first person to say that, but there's nothing under the international bank of Sudan.
Then pull up my father.
Bruce said he had different methods for hiding information for different clients.
Maybe there's a record of it.
There's nothing here but addresses and phone numbers.
Then look at the calendar the morning he dropped off the envelope.
Maybe there's a clue to where he went.
Wait.
There's an entry here from the morning.
It says "Bass traffic.
" I'm sorry.
We're not open to the public just yet.
Oh, we have an appointment.
Rufus Humphrey.
Hi.
This is Ivy Dickens.
Benedict Tate.
I'm doing P.
R.
for tonight's event.
So please, how can I be of assistance? We would like to purchase all of the artwork.
I appreciate your enthusiasm, but tonight's silent auction is expected to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars.
How many hundreds? You know, 8 has always been a lucky number for me.
So now you can, uh, cancel your expensive party and send everyone home.
I'm I'm sorry.
I think there's been a misunderstanding.
I am happy to deliver all the artwork to you after the event, but it's too late an hour to cancel.
And, well we need something on the walls.
Then I have an idea that may help you raise even more money.
When we came here on our first date, you didn't know how to hold the cue.
Did you spend the last five years taking billiard lessons? I could always play.
You hustled me.
Well, no.
I I just wanted to make you feel better after your epic French ordering failure.
Or maybe you were looking for an excuse for me to put my arms around you.
A girl never reveals her secrets.
Unless you're Gossip Girl.
Spotted two old flames slumming it on memory lane.
Who doesn't love a sequel? Did she give our exact location? Yeah, which means our mob of new friends are probably already camped outside.
We're just fueling their fire by being together.
Why don't I go out front with the Vespa? I'll distract 'em, and you just sneak out back and grab a taxi.
Well, we don't have to go right now.
I'm just about to win.
Please.
Let's let's not make my humiliation official.
And the sooner we get out of here, the better.
This was nice, though.
I'll miss it.
Mm.
Traffic.
Traffic jam.
Traffic light.
Maybe they had a meeting in a car.
Or it's Bart's oil trafficking or something else he's illegally selling.
Like a nuclear bomb in a briefcase.
You watch too many movies.
So does Bruce.
Wait.
That's it.
The movie "Traffic" is right here.
I remember in that film, the head of the drug cartel stored his illegal account information in the back of a painting.
What, you think that's where Bart hid whatever was in the envelope? Well, there's a lot of paintings in the Van Der Woodsen apartment.
I'm just, unfortunately, still banned from the building.
I guess I'll have to pay them a visit.
So I called and I called and I called and I called, and then I just never heard from him again.
Is that the end of the story? Mm-hmm.
Wow.
You really are so entertaining.
So when my mother returns, tell her that I apologized and that we're best friends.
I'm sorry, Blair.
This was fun, but I won't do that because it's not the truth.
Yes, it is.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.
No, it's not.
I have been cordial to you for the last 52 minutes.
Do you have any idea the psychological torture that I have endured being nice to you? I should have just skipped ahead to this from the start.
It that me as Mrs.
Mingott in a fat suit? That was embarrassing.
Agreed, which is why you don't want this bouncing around the blogosphere.
No one wants to take fashion advice from her.
Mother! Ladies, how are we getting along? Famously.
Blair just tried to blackmail me.
I'm sorry, Eleanor.
I tried.
This is all Nelly's fault.
She was clearly lying because she's always been jealous of me.
The only thing clear is that Daniel Humphrey was right about you.
You read that dreck? On the plane.
And his his central thesis is correct.
You are running my business like you're still the meanest girl in high school.
I am trying.
Relapse is part of recovery.
Please, just give me one more chance.
I'm sorry, Blair.
It's over.
I can't.
I have no other choice but to demote you and take back the presidency of Waldorf Designs, effective immediately.
Watch out, B.
They say you're only as good as the company you keep, and right now you're not keeping any.
What's going on? Why are you taking down the paintings for my event? I think you mean our event.
Since everyone in the art world is coming here tonight instead of my gallery opening, I decided to have my opening here.
That's outrageous.
I'm gonna talk to Benedict and have him reinstall my art immediately.
Well, that would be difficult since we own it all now.
Lily, welcome.
I see you've met our new event co-sponsors.
I have, and I'm not thrilled that my carefully curated pieces are being replaced without even so much as a phone call.
Oh.
Well, I'm sorry.
I never imagined that you'd object to raising more money for such a worthwhile cause.
Lily, Rufus and Ivy have helped A.
P.
F.
Break fund-raising records.
Certainly, sharing your hosting duties is a a small price to pay.
Of course, which is why you've inspired me to make my own additional donation, which I am sure will break their record.
Hold it right there, Humph-freak! Do you have any idea what a mess your article has made? No, but I'm guessing you're gonna tell me even if I keep walking.
My mother demoted me, thanks to your disparaging drivel.
Right, and I'm sure it had nothing to do with your work-related behavior.
Fix this, or when I'm done with you, you won't even have Georgina Sparks' couch in Brooklyn.
I will fly Vanessa back from whatever third-world country she's in if I have to.
Do you hear yourself? You're trying to bully me into retracting an article about you being a bully.
No.
I'm proving to my mother that I am the mature, polite, professional woman who should be running Waldorf Designs.
Blair, you tracked me down with your "Spotted" map and threatened me with the return of Vanessa.
You are not mature, polite, or professional, and even your own mother knows it.
Nelly? Do you think you could meet me at Lily's benefit tonight? There's something I think you would want to hear.
And you're sure there's nothing? There's nothing in any of this art.
It could be subtle.
Tape on the backing or rip in the seam.
No, there's nothing.
And the back of artwork is really boring.
Hold on one second.
Someone's coming.
Nate? What are you doing here? I am just writing a story on Lily's artwork for "The Spectator.
" Oh, for the A.
P.
F.
benefit tonight? Yeah.
Exactly.
What are you up to? Uh, just rereading an old short story.
Hey, is everybody a writer these days? It no, it's Dan's.
Wow.
Aren't you getting enough of him in "Vanity Fair"? It's the one from "The New Yorker.
" You know, the story about the first time he saw me at that party.
Do not tell me in some twisted turn of events that that s*x tape made you miss him.
No, it's just we spent some time together, and I don't know.
It it brought up some old memories.
Serena, you're really vulnerable right now after Steven broke up with you.
It's too soon to have real feelings for Dan.
But what if those feelings never really went away? That high school kid you fell in love with that's not who he is anymore, okay? He almost cost me "The Spectator" to sell his serial.
And he exploited all of us in those chapters.
I know.
You're right.
I mean, he has become a selfish egomaniac who will Serena destroy his friends for for money and attention, for fame and Ahem.
I know how much you like chocolate-covered strawberries.
Dan, wait.
Hey, listen, I better get going.
Wait.
What about the auction Serena mentioned? Look around.
Is there anything missing? That painting of the rainbow woman is gone.
Oh.
My Richard Phillips has arrived.
Lily, are you sure? You know, it's one of my favorite pieces in my collection, but it is for a good cause.
And I've already sent Bart an e-mail, and I know he will agree.
This is incredibly generous.
In fact, we're gonna have a live auction just for this special piece.
I know she will be the star of the show.
This work of art appears to be a work of Bart.
Let the bidding begin.
This is Spencer Sweeney, Patrick McMullan, and Fab Five Freddy.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Art Production Fund benefit.
First, I'd like to say a special thanks to Rufus Humphrey and Ivy Dickens for their tremendous contribution tonight.
Careful, Lily.
You paid a lot of money to fill those worry lines.
Listen, you vile little interloper, you and Rufus may have rubbed your last two nickels together to replace my art, but the only people that you're making fools of are yourselves.
But tonight, folks, the centerpiece of this event will be a special live auction of Richard Phillips' "Spectrum" courtesy of Lilian Bass' personal collection.
Bidding will begin shortly.
As I was saying, you can pretend to be Lola, you can pretend to be Serena, but you will never be me.
I don't want to be you.
I want to be better.
Rufus already thinks I am.
I always liked that painting.
I'm glad to see you two found each other.
Blair.
Nelly was just telling me you invited her here to meet with her.
I hope it is to make an official apology.
That I'd love to hear.
I'm not here to apologize to Nelly, mother.
I'm here to apologize to you.
Then what am I doing here? Shutting up and writing about it so you can publicly restore Waldorf designs' pristine reputation.
Blair, what is this about? Undoing all the damage my dark side has done.
I'm a bad seed, mother, so send me away to the village of the damned.
No one expects miracles, darling.
It's been part of you for 20-something years.
It's not going to go away overnight.
Just maybe sometime before I die.
Y you don't understand.
The real Grace Kelly had talent.
You have talent.
Even that goth princess Jenny Humphrey had talent.
But I don't.
It's all just pretense.
Well, your record of achievements prove otherwise.
Everything I have was from scheming and lying and working the angles.
I don't have what it takes.
You are Mozart.
I'm Salieri.
No matter how hard I work, I will never be you, and I think it was just my dark side trying to hide that.
So effective immediately, I resign from Waldorf Designs.
Did you reach anyone from A.P.F.?
I finally got a hold of an assistant, but she said they're only taking bids in person.
How far away are you? At least ten blocks.
Is there no way around this, like on the sidewalk? I like that your artists reflect the same socially relevant projects we commission at art production fund.
And I like that you can see the street art influence.
I'm not talking about the '80s but the '40s Dubuffet, Pollack, Ray Johnson.
Yeah, when artists were the stars of New York instead of celebutantes.
Yes.
Excuse me.
Can I speak to you for a moment? What can I do for you, Lily? Are you interested in one of my Pfahler pieces to replace your Phillips? No, thank you, and I think you've made your point here, Rufus.
This is a benefit to raise money for a good cause, and I won't have your little freeloader making a mockery of it by bidding on things she can't afford.
Ivy can afford any painting she wants.
And with what money? I know it's not yours.
You're right.
It's Cece's.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we are ready to begin, I would like to start the bidding for the Richard Phillips at $500,000.
$500,000.
I have $500,000.
Lola gave it back to her when she found out your mother wanted Ivy to have it.
$500,000.
Going once? $500,000.
Do I have $520,000? $520,000.
She may have been able to con Lola out of half my mother's estate, but she'll never get anything of mine.
Do I have $540,000? Going once? $540,000.
$560,000.
$560,000.
Do I have $570,000? $570,000.
$570,000.
$570,000.
Do I have $580,000? $580,000.
$580,000.
Do I have $600,000? $750,000.
$750,000.
I know it sounded bad, but you heard it out of context.
In what context can "selfish egomaniac" be positive? I was telling Nate what a good time I had with you, but th Yeah, I heard the "but" part.
But that it's confusing for me because I have spent the past few months hating you.
I told you I loved you, and then you rejected me for my best friend.
You've rejected me for nearly everyone on the Upper East Side.
Can you blame me for having doubts? You had more than doubts.
You told me you never wanted to see me again.
You mean, after you used me to make a s*x tape to destroy me and your best friend? I'm not the bad guy here.
You want everyone to believe you're poor, sweet Dan Humphrey from Brooklyn, but you sent that video of Chuck and Blair into "Gossip Girl" to try to ruin her wedding, and then you pinned it on me.
Yeah, I didn't want Blair to marry the wrong man.
And it's not like you've never used "Gossip Girl" to further your own agenda.
Oh, wait.
Oh, wait.
You were Gossip Girl for a second.
Only to restore balance after Georgina's reign of terror who who is now partnering with you to attack and humiliate everyone that we care about in your exposes? Which leads us back to your reason for calling me a selfish egomaniac.
You're right.
Now I now I understand.
Good.
I'm glad.
I was being sarcastic, Serena.
So was I.
No, you weren't.
Yes, I was.
Look look, ob obviously, too much has happened over the past five years.
No matter who we are today, we can't undo the things we've done in the past, so it's probably best we just move on without each other.
Which I will do the second we get out of this elevator.
$880,000.
I have $880,000.
Do I hear $900,000? $900,000.
$900,000.
What do you think you're doing? $920,000.
I'd ask you the same thing.
Bidding on an item you put up for auction? I changed my mind when this gypsy trash wanted it.
She will not have anything near and dear to my heart.
$940,000 once? $940,000.
$960,000.
I assure you I won't let her win if you stop bidding.
And why should I trust you? I know you teamed up with this charlatan to cause problems with your father and me.
This painting means more to me than anything.
$980,000.
What do you think you're doing? We're supposed to be on the same side.
So you are still aligned with her? I'm on nobody's side but my own.
$1 million, ladies and gentlemen.
$1.
1 million.
Do I hear 1.
2? Going once.
Going twice.
Sold for $1.
1 million to the man in front.
Congratulations.
Revenge is sweet, especially when you have a sugar mama.
Unfortunately, not all families appreciate just desserts.
I just wanted to congratulate you and apologize.
I admit that I was out of line with some of the things that I said earlier.
And you obviously want something now.
Well, I know how important it was for you to prove that you could best me publicly.
And now that you've achieved what you wanted, I would love to buy my painting back.
Well, if you wanted it so much, why'd you put it up for auction? I had no idea how much it meant to me till it was gone.
And let's face it, Rufus.
Do you really want that hanging in your loft, reminding you of me? I don't.
We'll give it to a museum one far away from Manhattan where you won't even be able to visit.
Surely there's a price that will change your mind.
No.
You can't buy us off the way you do everyone else.
We don't want your money.
What is it you want then? To make you feel the way you've made us feel humiliated and powerless and like you're worth nothing.
So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make sure they're packing up our painting.
I'll see you later.
And you remain a kept man.
I never thought I would say this, Lil, but I think Ivy's right.
You brought this on yourself.
Maybe you should try Vanya again.
It's been, like, 47 seconds since I called.
And unlike last time we were stuck here, I remembered to use your name.
Oh, if we're recreating that, you should probably try to crawl out of the ceiling any moment.
I admit that was not one of my better ideas.
Why why were you so mad about it, then? Because I didn't want you to get hurt.
I'm sure you want me to hit the floor right now.
Throw me down the elevator shaft.
Or, hell, you know, you could just trick me into making another s*x tape.
It's the people you know best that you can hurt the most.
I'm sorry I didn't say anything when you told me you loved me.
It it was easier to focus on my anger at Blair than face the possibility of getting what I always wanted and and and losing it again.
What you always wanted? You know, I had a really great time with you today.
I had to believe that you were terrible in order to protect myself.
Well, you know, I could actually be terrible if you prefer.
No.
No, thank you.
I'm good.
I I much prefer you this way.
Yeah, the feeling's mutual.
I will try Vanya again.
Well I guess that's my cue.
Or you could come up and have some chocolate-covered strawberries before you face the paparazzi.
Yeah.
That sounds nice.
If you've come for a follow-up interview, I have no comment.
Actually, I came to say thanks for the exclusive and maybe to gloat a little.
How did you know where to find me? The met steps? Where else would you go to make yourself feel better? My mother always said you'd peaked in high school.
You mean when no one else spoke to you besides your mother? You can make fun of how unpopular I used to be, but the person no one cares about anymore is you.
Then why are you still sitting below me on the steps? Habit.
Like a headband.
Just a remnant from when you were a tastemaker.
And all every girl at constance wanted was to be just like me.
Lucky for all of us, like the eco-clothing trend, those days are gone.
You obviously don't shop in Brooklyn.
But thank you, Nelly.
Your misinformation has been invaluable.
Where are you going? You won't look good in hemp.
But you will, while you eat crow.
I just hope it's not too late.
Thank you so much for letting us use your painting in the auction.
Um, Todd Diciurcio, this is Chuck Bass.
It's a beautiful painting.
Excuse us.
Great work tonight.
No thanks to you.
I thought we were on the same team.
We are, which is why you should sell me that painting.
Lily already tried that.
I hope you turned her down.
That piece is a critical component of my campaign against Bart.
As you know, if I topple him, Lily won't be far behind.
What's a queen without her king? I'll sell you the painting for double what I paid.
That's a price I'm willing to pay.
All right, I'll have it delivered.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Spotted Ivy moonlighting as a gallerina.
Better hope this masterpiece isn't a forgery.
Is it weird to say I'm I'm glad we got in that fight? No, no.
No, not at all.
I am, too.
That storage unit I kept packed full of old resentments was getting pretty full.
You know, I I feel like I did when I first came back to the city from boarding school, when all I wanted was a fresh start.
Well, you have one now, at least with me.
I, uh, should probably take off.
It's getting pretty late.
Oh, did you ever find a place? Technically, no.
But, I mean, I got that check now, so Mm.
I can afford a hotel room.
I don't want to impose too much.
No, you're you're not imposing at all.
Are you sure? I mean, just this morning, you were saying you thought it might ruin our friendship.
Well, I think if we could get through the last five years, then we could get through a few more nights.
So y you can stay.
Or you don't have to.
You can go, too.
Or you can stay.
Whatever you want.
That's what I want.
I made a mistake.
Many.
Who hasn't? You'll have to be more specific, dear.
When I quit earlier.
I thought that I was using my dark side to hide the fact that I have no talent.
I wasn't the one who said you didn't have talent, Blair.
No, but you told me to squash my dark side, which is my talent.
It's my inspiration.
You can't blackmail your way through business.
Well, I agree, but I'm not talking about my management style, which I admit needs help to stay on the straight and narrow.
I'm talking about my designs.
Oh, where is this coming from? High school.
My Grace Kelly did have talent.
She got me straight A's and the perfect boyfriend.
But it was my Grace Jones that had everyone wanting to dress like me, not because they admired my hard work but because they were fascinated by my ferocity.
You did instill fear in the hearts of many.
I need to stop trying to be you and use my power to form the fashionistas of the future With a line for high school girls, inspired by my Constance uniform.
I'm not sure people want to wear uniforms if they're not in school.
These won't be the uniforms they have to wear.
They'll be the uniforms they beg to wear ones they see on the girls they want to be.
They own this town.
Uniforms? Well, they do represent power and authority and instill a sense of belonging.
And the girls I dress won't follow trends.
They will set them, just like I did.
You always were very influential.
Please.
Give me one more chance to prove it.
So what do you expect to find? The financial records of Bart's oil deal.
Which, when I finally hand over to the FBI, will ensure he spends the rest of his days playing pinochle with Bernie Madoff.
Thank you.
Well, I guess it's not time to break out the handcuffs just yet.
Where the hell is that envelope? Maybe "Traffic" meant something else or we got the wrong painting.
No.
No.
Lily was too determined to get this one.
And the Phillips in my bedroom has a backing on it.
Then someone took it off.
Then they've got the evidence! Remember that silver bullet we were looking for? I found it.
You know, I really think it's time for you to come back.
The sooner, the better.
I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this.
I gotta go.
One pepperoni pizza, extra cheese to go with a bottle of Dom Perignon an unexpected yet brilliant combination, just like us.
The Beatles sang, "Living is easy with eyes closed.
" Bart, I am so sorry.
I had no idea that's where you hid the records of your oil deals.
But even with our eyes open, we all still have blind spots.
Or maybe we're just looking in the wrong place.
So this will be aimed at the 12-to-25 set.
Marc Jacobs has "Marc by" Mm-hmm.
And Waldorf Designs will have "B.
" Oh, I just love that.
Yeah! But when we finally do see the light, it's strawberry fields forever.
Wait a second.

Gossip Girl here.
Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
You are running my business like you're still the meanest girl in high school.
I need to use my power to form the fashionistas of the future, with a line for high school girls inspired by my constance uniform.
I'm sorry I didn't say anything when you told me you loved me.
All I wanted was a fresh start.
That's what I want.
Well, we had to come to some kind of agreement, or we never would've left that hotel room in Monte Carlo.
It won't be much longer, I promise.
We're happy to extend "The Spectator's" line of credit.
Are you sure wanna cosign on this loan? Send me the documents to sign in the morning.
When Ivy was in the apartment, she said Bart walked in with an envelope he held on to rather tightly.
Is there anything missing? That painting of the rainbow woman is gone.
In that film, the head of the drug cartel stored his illegal account information in the back of a painting.
Sold for $1.
1 million.
That piece is a critical component of my campaign against Bart.
If I topple him, Lily won't be far behind.
I'll sell you the painting.
Where the hell is that envelope? Someone took it off.
Then they've got the evidence! And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

Presented by Page Senegal Desperate times call for desperate measures.
And even the most disciplined people can resort to destruction Funny, I didn't ask for turndown service.
But did you find what you're looking for? While others try to rebuild bridges using more intimate tactics.
Wow, this is amazing.
Really.
And I'm not just talking about this espresso.
I wish we could just stay like this forever.
Me, too.
The only thing missing is fresh air.
Are you--do you think maybe today that we could, uh Actually go outside? Come on.
You know that we can't be seen together in public until we're sure that this is absolutely real.
Well, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure.
I can't think of any reason to hold back.
Well, here's a big one.
All of our friends are furious at us.
If we wanna be a couple in the real world, we need to go out and make amends.
Okay, where do we start? I'll start with Blair, and you start with Nate.
And then afterwards, brunch and a movie on me.
I promise.
Okay.
Yeah, my, uh, suite needs tidying.
Could you please send the maid service? On second thought, send all the maids you have.
Where is it? In the safe? I see you changed the combination.
What could possibly be so important that you misplaced it? Your Viagra? Cut the crap, Chuck.
There's the Richard Phillips.
It used to have a backing.
I know you have it.
You mean the papers that hold the proof to your illegal oil activities? Papers? You don't have it.
You don't even know what you're looking for.
Oh, sorry to interrupt this riveting oedipal showdown, but I think I have what you're looking for.
Mr.
Boyer! Mr.
Boyer! Could I speak with you, please? This is completely inappropriate, Mr.
Archibald.
I'm on personal time.
I apologize for the intrusion, but you won't return any of my phone calls.
All right, I'll be brief, I promise.
Look, your credit line was due last week.
Now if you can't come up with the funds, I don't see how I can assist you.
Mr.
Boyer, this paper means everything to me.
I've put all my personal assets into it, all right? You know how people always tell you to bet on yourself? Well, that's what I did, and I just-- I need someone else to bet on me, too.
Look, I respect your passion, but I'm afraid in this economy, people aren't willing to take a bet.
"The spectator" is not a risk.
It won't fail because it can't.
It's everything I've got, Mr.
Boyer.
Now if you could just get me a little more time No promises, but I'll talk to the lender.
Oh! Thank you.
Thank you.
I promise you won't regret it.
Yes.
Just think, Dorota.
I started off dressing the minions, and now I'll be dressing the masses.
Miss Blair has come long way.
All grown up with her--her own Barneys co-op pop-up shop.
Now the gift bags must be perfect.
What are you doing here? Blair, I know that I've done some horrible things, but I am so sorry, and I've come to make amends.
Amends would imply that there's something to be mended.
What you did can never be fixed.
You've sworn that our friendship is beyond repair in the past, but we've always gotten through it.
Well, this time is different.
You seduced Dan on the bar at the Campbell apartment-- the very same spot you deflowered my first boyfriend.
I would never be that cruel to you on purpose.
I won't accept losing you.
So I'm just gonna sit here until you realize how sorry I am and how much I love you.
Suit yourself.
Sit there, quietly, like a mannequin.
That's what you're best at anyway.
And what are you best at, Blair? Your new junior line? And what makes you think the Katniss Everdeen generation is going to care about Blair Waldorf's pleated skirts? You're not a teenager anymore.
So? Designers don't have to be teenagers in order to influence them.
In--in fact, no one-- Is talking to you! Just be quiet.
The world already has Stella and Phoebe and the Mulleavy sisters.
Blair's too old to be the queen bee and not established enough to be a fashion star.
She's stuck in the middle.
And what could be less cool than being a tween? Well, I guess we'll have to see tonight.
I could tell by the frenzy at the auction there had to be more at stake than just art.
And then I found the microfilm in the painting.
I don't know what those numbers mean, but they obviously mean a lot to you.
Name your price.
Whatever he says, I'll double it.
I don't want money.
What do you want, then? Lily.
Last year, Lily did everything in her power to hurt me and leave me with nothing.
No friends, no family, no home.
I want Lily to know how that feels.
That's my price.
Surely there must be something else.
All I want is for Lily to be left with no one and nothing.
Now whichever one of you makes that happen first can have the microfilm.
I'll be waiting to hear your plans.
And be creative.
It went perfectly! You should've seen Bart and Chuck squirm! Oh! I can't wait to see Lily get caught in their cross fire.
You really played this out masterfully.
I'm so proud of you.
I am just glad this is almost over.
I missed you so much, it hurt.
But sometimes the partner is more shocking than the crime itself.
Okay, what if Nelly is right? What if my line gets lost because I'm not in high school or that my dad's not a Beatle? Miss Blair, take deep breaths.
Hey, B.
, you may not be the queen bee anymore, but sage is.
If you get her on your side, all the other girls will follow.
What makes you think sage would do either of us a favor? She wouldn't, but she'd do anything to keep me and Steven apart.
You are apart.
Well, maybe we make it look like we're getting back together.
I have a photo on my phone.
It's not a s*x tape, but it is a kiss.
Maybe we date stamp it to make it look like it was taken today.
And send to "Gossip Girl" to trick miss sage.
But all sage would have to do is ask her dad if it's true.
It makes perfect sense that he would cover our relationship.
He knows that sage hates us being together.
So sage sees the blast and comes to me for help, just like when she thought Steven was proposing, which gives me leverage to ask for her support.
I'll admit, it's not a terrible plan.
Of course, I need photo approval.
Let me find it.
_ Acceptable.
Now go.
No one can suspect we're conspiring.
Of course not.
You know, I-I played Hedda Gabler in high school, but acting like I'm into Rufus when I'm really in love with you is the hardest role of my life.
You deserve an Oscar, darling.
But take solace in knowing that you serve a higher cause.
Giving Lily her comeuppance? Though I-I still wish we had taken the money and run, like I wanted to.
So do I, but this is what Lola wanted.
And Lily deserves to pay for the way she treated you.
I owe Lola for a lot more than just the money.
I mean, if she hadn't asked you to help transfer the funds to me, I would've never met the real you.
Even though it was awful to tear myself away from you, your plan was brilliant.
Well, now you have access to Lily's secrets and influence to turn Rufus against her.
But if I eat another waffle, I'll puke.
Now that our plan's almost done, can't I please stop this charade? Not yet.
Not yet, no.
I mean, the--the microfilm may be our golden ticket, but we still have to see if Chuck or Bart are willing to sacrifice Lily for it.
Come on.
Let me buy you lunch.
And this way, you don't have to subsist on waffles alone.
I know a small, out-of-the-way place.
I'll pull the car around, okay? Sounds wonderful.
Oh, thank God.
I've been sick with worry.
Did you find the microfilm at Charles'? No, because Chuck doesn't have it.
Ivy does.
What? How? She found it in the lining of the painting before she sold it to Chuck the night of the auction.
I am so sorry, Bart.
W-what does she want for it? You.
She will give the records to me or Chuck in exchange for destroying your life.
With Ivy, I'm not surprised.
Of course, I would never do anything to harm you, but I worry Chuck will take her up on her offer.
Oh, Charles would never actively hurt me.
Don't be naive, Lily.
If Chuck gets a hold of the microfilm, he'll figure it out.
Let me call Rufus.
Maybe he'll be reasonable and help me get it back before anyone gets hurt.
Do what you can.
In the meantime, I'll work on Chuck.
You're not seriously thinking about taking Ivy's deal, are you? I may have no choice.
I asked Lily for help before.
She refused.
Hey.
Sorry to interrupt.
What do you want? I came to apologize.
I've been doing some soul-searching.
That implies you have a soul.
That's funny, coming from you.
That's hilarious.
I mean, who would've thought Chuck Bass turns out to be the good guy and Humphrey the villain? Well, I-I-I really wanna turn that around.
I'm sorry about what I wrote about all of you.
I'm here to make amends.
Well, if you really mean that You just gave me an idea.
_ Well, if it isn't Gypsy Rose Lee Without the talent.
I have no need for strippers or s*x tapes at my pop-up shop, so please run along.
You should be thanking me.
That tape got you exactly what you wanted.
And did it get you what you wanted? Yeah, it did.
My dad and Serena split up, which is how I want them to stay.
I saw the "Gossip Girl" blast.
Has Serena said anything to you about getting back together with my father? She's my best friend.
She tells me everything.
So it's true.
Of course, the minute I go to my mom's, he goes crawling back to her.
He swore to me that things were over between them.
I might be willing to give you some guidance.
That is, if you do something for me.
Name it.
You're the queen of constance, and I know there's a secret society made of the monarchs of the five most powerful private schools in Manhattan.
I know because I created it.
So? I want a meeting with the heads of the five families.
Make it quick, Lily.
I know you hate me, Rufus.
You made that abundantly clear when you helped Ivy enact her revenge at the auction.
Get to the point.
Ivy's done something now that goes far beyond hurting me.
It endangers my family, my children.
They used to be your family, too.
W-what kind of danger are you talking about? Ivy's in possession of some business records.
They're simple documents.
They mean nothing to anyone outside of our family, but they have the power to destroy us.
Please find it in your heart to be the bigger person.
Get them back for me.
If you had nothing to hide, then no one could use this evidence against you.
Lily, I'm sorry.
You reap what you sow.
I'm not getting involved.
Well, thank you for the lovely lunch.
My pleasure.
We're almost at the finish line, my love.
Yeah.
And it looks like Chuck will be the winner.
He wants me to meet him now to tell me his plan.
Call when you can.
Yeah.
Hey.
I don't know why you're here, but get out before security throws you out.
That's not a nice way to greet your partner.
What are you talking about? You are indebted to me, and I'm here to collect.
So unless to wanna lose everything, you're gonna help me defeat Chuck.
Buck up.
It's gonna be fun.
Betrayal is a bitter pill to swallow, but nothing's worse than having blackmail shoved down your throat.
Dons Nightingale, Brearley, Chapin, and Spence, let us now have this meeting commence.
Don constance, why is she here? I'm here, nightingale, because not only was I the queen of constance, but I also invented this council.
So as Regina emerita, it is my royal prerogative to command you to attend my pop-up event tonight and be fans.
Sage, you shouldn't have brought her here.
This isn't an alumni event.
Don Brearley is right.
It's a clear breach of security.
Invoke the order of the secrets.
Order of the what? Codified blackmail.
If they don't do what you say, you spill their secrets.
Look, the rules say I'm entitled to ask the council for one favor during my reign.
This is it.
And if you refuse, she'll have no choice but to reveal your affair with your drama teacher.
Your Latin teacher? Your father's business partner.
What? That's how we did it in my day.
We'll grant don constance her one request, and reconvene at the pop-up event.
The attire is festive cocktail! When did the queens start calling themselves "Don"? Well, everyone loves a crown, but when it comes to power, the mob totally trumps the monarchy.
You cosigned my credit line? I never asked you to do that.
Ingratitude doesn't become you, Nathaniel.
You have put so much work into "The Spectator.
" It would be a shame to lose it all now.
I'm not gonna betray my best friend.
My loan will be in default.
I'll file for bankruptcy.
And as for "The Spectator," you can take it.
Your loyalty is very touching, but I'm afraid your actions have more serious consequences.
You couldn't resist faking the numbers.
Must be An Archibald gene.
So you have a choice.
Either you can tell me Chuck's plan to win over Ivy, or you can go to prison and drag your mother and grandfather through a public disgrace even more sensational than that of your father's.
What's it gonna be? I usually frown upon negotiating with terrorists, but stamping out my father's freedom has become my life's mission.
What's your plan to destroy Lily? Simply play the powerful card we've been dealt.
The microfilm's enough to put her away, too, as long as she appears to be Bart's accomplice.
You mean plant it on her.
Precisely.
You give me the film, I'll do the dirty work, then tip off the feds.
Okay.
But it has to happen in public.
I want prison plus humiliation.
Not a problem.
Bring the film to Blair's event tonight, and I'll take care of the rest.
Done.
Dan, what are you doing here? Oh.
Hey, dad.
I'm just, uh, just picking up some of my stuff here.
But I'm--I'm mainly here to see you.
I hurt you.
I-I jeopardized our relationship, which means more to me than anything.
I'm--I'm here to make amends with you and Ivy.
I'm happy you wanna make amends, son, but I owe you an apology as well.
It looks like you were right about Ivy.
I was a fool for trusting her.
Honey, I'm home! I'll take that as my cue.
What's going on? You tell me.
I saw you putting someone in a town car today, kissing him good-bye.
I opened my heart to you.
I opened my home.
I believed you when you said you were protecting me from Lily.
At least have the decency to tell me what was true and what were lies.
It was all true.
I mean, Lily was horrible to you, like she is to everyone.
And what about us? There was someone else before you.
And I thought it was over, but I ran into him last week and realized it wasn't.
I'm sorry, Rufus.
Pack your bags and get out.
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Let's get to the pop-up! Serena, your scheme is unfolding on schedule.
I except to see you at my event tonight for the denouement.
And I won't mind if you're not mute.
I suppose I could use a friend there with me to celebrate my success.
Come on, come on, come on, come on! Don Brearley, I just saw my dad, who is miserable with heartache.
If he is really back with Serena and lying to me, he wouldn't be blubbering like a baby.
We've been played.
I'll see you at the pop-up party but the plan has changed.
Hey, man, I did what you asked.
I searched the loft and no luck.
But I saw Ivy on the way out and spotted the envelope in her bag.
Did you get it? No, I couldn't.
There was no way.
They would've seen me.
I understand, which is why I have a backup plan.
Ivy will bring the microfilm to Blair's event tonight.
The feds will be there.
I convinced her I'd plant it on Lily.
Lily's going to Blair's junior line debut? No, but Ivy doesn't know that.
I'd never hurt Lily.
I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
Thanks for trying, Humphrey.
The important thing is, I got to Ivy before my father did.
Bart.
You're too late.
I already struck a deal with-- Chuck.
A takedown at Blair's fashion party.
But in actuality, he lured you to the empire to distract you while Dan searched the loft.
Hold on a sec.
If he was trying to steal the microfilm, he didn't succeed.
Chuck has no intention of having Lily arrested.
He was planning on screwing you over all along.
And why should I believe you? Because I have someone here who can confirm everything I'm saying is true.
Isn't that right, Nate? It's true.
Luckily, I have an offer for you.
The Dons.
Thank God you're here.
Now start fawning.
Loudly.
And I know that you don't have a limit on your credit cards So buy, buy, buy! Sorry, Blair.
I called off the favor.
What? I know you duped me about my dad and Serena.
I only brought the Dons here to be detractors.
And if we say the clothes suck, it's law.
Come on, girls.
And remember, plastic stays in pockets.
Wait.
Wait, Dons.
Dons? Blair.
I must admit, I'm impressed the high school crowd showed up.
We'll just have to see whether they love or hate the line.
I'll go get quotes from them for "W.
W.
D.
" Oh! Wait.
You know what? You simply must see my accessories.
They're in the corner.
The far corner.
This way.
You sure he didn't see it was me? If Rufus had seen you, he would've said so.
This couldn't be better.
Now I don't have to invent a reason to break up with him.
This "breakup" mustn't undo all the work you did to poison Rufus against Lily.
I mean, our efforts are for nothing if Rufus takes her back the minute she hits rock bottom.
He won't take her back.
Well, then we're at the end of our road.
Mm, it's all riding on your meeting with Bart.
I'll do whatever it takes.
It's been an hour.
Where is she? Her phone is still off.
This isn't a game, Mr.
Bass.
You said you had hard evidence.
Don't waste our time again.
Chuck.
Oh, you're here.
Things are going horribly.
Girls today are out of control.
They're like tiny little vultures.
Then Blair Waldorf would be the falcon who dives in and devours them all.
Please.
Compared to them, I'm like a turtledove.
Well, at least Nelly's distracted talking to D.
V.
F.
I need to find Serena and force her to fix things with sage.
The line looks beautiful.
I'm sure it's going to be a huge success.
Unless I can do some damage control, there's no chance of that.
Speaking of, I need to do some damage control myself.
Well, good luck.
It's my faith in you that's firing me up to fix this mess.
Did you bring it? Yes.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours first.
I'm divorcing Lily.
Here are the papers.
You may leak them to whomever you choose.
That's hardly enough.
Lily's been divorced four, fives times already.
Who can keep count? I want her humiliated.
What did you have in mind? Take off your clothes.
Excuse me? You heard me.
Strip.
I should have expected the typical Serena sabotage-- pretending to be my friend and then sending in those mini mafiosas to blow up my pop-up shop.
Sage knows you're not back with Steven.
I wonder who told her.
Well, it wasn't me, I swear.
Blair, I just wanna help.
If I choose to believe you, and if you really wanna help, then come up with a new scheme before those teenage goombas ruin everything.
Miss Waldorf, may I take a picture? Look, I'll do whatever you want, but you don't need a scheme.
Your line is spectacular and it speaks for itself.
And there's nothing that sage or anyone can do to change that.
It's time for you to start trusting yourself and accepting the fact that you are obscenely talented.
You really mean that? Yes.
B.
, your clothes are beautiful and original, like you.
Don't take my word for it.
Look around.
Hey! What are you doing? This is the last size 2, and I liked it first.
Sorry.
All's fair in shopping and war.
What are you guys doing?! You're supposed to be hating on everything.
But we love it, and devotion to great clothes trumps five family loyalty.
Uh, hi.
Excuse me.
Do you mind if I quote you? Oh, my gosh.
They like me.
They really like me! Nathaniel, what are you doing? It's not like you to be partying alone.
Well, that's what I want to be--alone and unconscious.
Believe me, whatever problems you've got at "The Spectator" cannot compare to my day from hell.
So if you don't mind, I'd like to join you.
Chuck It was, uh, it was all my fault.
What was? There was nothing I could do.
He cornered me.
"He" who? My father? You tell me what happened.
What did he do? What did he make you do? What Tell me.
Before we do this The microfilm.
Oh.
No, we're not actually going to have s*x.
I just wanna take a couple snapshots to make it look like we did.
All that matters is that Lily believes she lost two husbands to me.
I'm fine being your Eliot Spitzer scandal, but I'm a pay-for-play kinda guy.
The microfilm first.
Ivy.
Oh, God.
Don't do this.
My father will screw you, then screw you over.
It's not too late to do the right thing.
Behind the curve as always, Chuck.
It is too late.
What is this, some kind of joke? What in the world are you doing here? I know I said I wouldn't help you, but I changed my mind.
I have what you're looking for.
They say nothing inspires forgiveness quite like revenge.
The microfilm was in that envelope, I swear.
If you don't find it and hand it over-- all the torture you wished on Lily, it'll seem like child's play.
My father's threats aren't idle.
Neither are mine.
There's only one person who knew I had it, who might know where it is.
Thanks.
Since when did you start spiking your chamomile? Oh, it's been a rough day.
Hope this makes things a bit better.
You have no idea.
Thank you, Rufus.
What made you change your mind? Ivy's not who I thought she was.
I know.
I should've been tipped off by the whole "pretending to be your niece" thing.
Well, you always believe the best in people.
It's your virtue and your downfall.
I still see the best in you, Lil.
After everything that we've been through, it's probably safe to say that we won't be together again.
But we were family for a long time, and that means something.
I'd really like peace between us.
Dad, hey.
What are you doing here? You inspired me to make some amends of my own, son.
Are you getting back together with Lily? W-- No, I'm just returning something of Lily's that Ivy stole.
Why is this person taking so long getting back to you? I I don't know.
_ Where you going? Does Blair need you to come over to kill a spider? I'm not wasting any more time.
So you're giving up? What a shocker.
You're right.
You know me so well.
My patience is wearing thin.
You better make this person appear fast.
We almost sold out.
I feel like I'm dreaming.
Uh-oh.
2 girls wrestling for last 3-button vest.
I go act as referee.
I have always known that I had the most brilliant, talented best friend, but now the whole world gets to know, too.
Thank you.
I'm sorry for accusing you of turning sage against me.
No, I'm sorry for everything.
I don't think I was ever able to get over how hurt I was that you were dating Dan, which is why I acted so badly.
I get it.
If you'd have dated Chuck, I would've scratched your eyes out.
I've really missed you.
I missed you, too, B.
You're about to get everything you ever wanted, and tonight's success is-- is just the beginning.
Well, this line was inspired by both of us, ruling constance together.
This is your success, too.
I just hope that this night leads to The other thing I've always wanted-- to be with Chuck.
He loves you more than anything in the whole world.
You'll find your great love, too.
Um, I should probably get going.
But breakfast tomorrow morning? Sarabeth's? Yes.
9:00 A.
M.
sharp.
Congratulations, B.
Thank you.
Lily, please! Don't protect him.
Why wouldn't I protect my husband? He's the only one that protects me.
No, that's not true.
You're the one willing to go to any lengths, and I've had enough of it.
I know you wanna believe he is a changed man, that he is a good man.
And I wanted to believe that, too, so badly.
But the truth is, is he is a ruthless criminal.
If you destroy that evidence, there is nothing to stop him from hurting anyone, including you.
That's ridiculous, Charles.
He would never hurt me.
Since his return, he has done nothing but prove his love.
You once told me my father was incapable of love.
That is the truth.
I just saw him in a hotel room, half-naked, with Ivy.
That lie Is beneath even you, Charles.
I'm not gonna let you or anyone else threaten our family ever again.
Don't! Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.
Even the best-laid plans can go bust.
Where have you been? I've been calling for an hour.
I just got your messages.
Are you-- Okay? No! I'm not okay! Our plan failed.
Okay, Rufus must've taken the microfilm from my purse and given it to Lily.
I was with Bart when she called him to tell him that she destroyed it.
So Lily's still with Bart? Yes.
And now that he knows I'm after Lily, he's threatened to destroy me.
Look, he's scary, William.
He'll do it.
Calm down for a second.
I can't! Can't you see that without the microfilm, we can't fight back? I know that I-I promised Lola that we'd do everything we could to destroy Lily.
But we've done everything that we could.
You're right.
I suppose we should leave and regroup for now.
I know that we didn't get Lily, but The most important thing is that we have each other.
Of course.
Hello? So Chuck's little game is over, Nathaniel.
In spite of you tipping him off, he lost.
Of course, once a loser, always a loser.
Why don't you go give your S-stirring little victory speech to someone who cares? Oh, yeah.
That's right.
No one does.
You're just lucky that Lily destroyed the microfilm and bought you a reprieve.
I own you, and you better start acting like it.
What, you gonna call the police? All right, fine.
Just do it.
Have me arrested.
Oh, you're of more use to me out of jail For the moment.
You owe me.
Sober up and get ready to pay the price.
There you are.
The line was a gigantic success.
Even the mannequins were stripped naked.
And now we are having a fete at the atelier to celebrate, so of course I need you by my side.
And why haven't you been answering your phone? I'm happy for you, Blair.
Forget me.
Chuck? What happened? What I should've always expected.
The only parent who ever loved me, the mother who chose me as a son, abandoned me.
I finally had the evidence to vanquish my father.
She destroyed it to protect him.
We'll find new evidence.
We'll find another way.
There is no other way.
This was it.
It's over.
Well, even if we can't put Bart behind bars, we'll still be together.
Stop lying to yourself.
We made a pact.
You fulfilled your side.
I failed at mine.
We can't be together.
Chuck Please.
Go.
Just go.
So I finally made amends with Blair, and we're in a really good place and I couldn't be happier.
How was your day? I hate to compete, but I made amends with Chuck, Nate, and my dad.
Wow.
I'm impressed.
Yeah, all right.
So now that we've knocked down our last obstacles, are we finally ready to do this? Well, do you remember that we said if we ever jumped into a relationship again that that would be it? That we would only get one more chance? Are you sure that I'm the one person you wanna be with? Are you talking about Blair? Serena, yes, I'm sure you are the one.
But whether or not I've admitted it to myself, you have always been the one.
How about you? Yeah, I'm sure.
Wait.
Hold on.
I thought the whole point of this was to go public.
Uh, what--what happened to getting fresh air? I mean, shouldn't we go out and get a drink or something? Suddenly, I'm okay with being a shut-in.
Let me at least get champagne so we can celebrate.
Sometimes the light is so dazzling it's all you can see.
Other times, dark clouds devour you, and it seems the skies will never clear.
_ But when the sun beams while the rain falls, it can bring a bittersweet rainbow.
I only have a minute.
Humphrey, going rogue is not part of our agreement.
Where the hell have you been? I'm writing the Serena chapter.
What? Presented by Page Senegal So watch out.
Just when you think you're dancing off into the sunset, a lightning bolt may strike you down.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
Gossip girl here-- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I made a deal to sell some oil from the Sudan.
There was an embargo in place, which made it illegal.
Was anyone hurt? - No.
She said Bart walked in with an envelope.
And he's not about to show you what's in the envelope.
He won't, but someone else might--Bruce Caplan.
The Bass business manager? I'm not gonna let you threaten our family ever again.
Don't! You are indebted to me, and I'm here to collect.
Chuck, it was all my fault.
He cornered me.
My father? Are you sure that I'm the one person you wanna be with? You have always been the one.
Humphrey, where the hell have you been? I'm writing the Serena chapter.
Well, even if we can't put Bart behind bars, we'll still be together.
We made a pact.
We can't be together.
Gobble, gobble, upper east siders.
That's right.
It's Thanksgiving again.
And I hope you all brought your appetites, because today's the one day a year you're supposed to count your blessings I love the parade.
And not your calories.
I don't care whether you're sick to your stomach or simply on a liquid diet.
This turkey day, I'm going to make sure everyone eats their hearts out.
Dorota, did you remember my noise-canceling headphones and my Bottega eye mask? Flying alone on the holidays is like Chatroulette.
So why go to Paris? We both know today is most favorite day of year.
Ah, yes, it is true.
Thanksgiving does hold a special place in my heart-- and stomach-- but I guess this year a pumpkin macaroon will just have to do.
But every Thanksgiving, you try to visit Miss Eleanor.
And this year, I'm actually going to make it.
Besides, we both know that if I stay in town, I'll just be meddling in other people's affairs, and I promised myself I would not do that this year.
Still no word from Mr .
Chuck since pop-up show? No, and I'm not going to call him either.
Chuck only goes darker when I push him, so I'm gonna give him all the time and space he needs.
He'll snap out of his funk eventually.
And you okay leaving Miss Serena alone with Mr.
Lonely Boy? Well, I don't want her back with that backstabbing Brooklynite, but now that we're best friends again, I have to just hold my tongue and let this ridiculous relationship run its course.
Like stomach flow.
Yes, and until then, I will just play the supportive friend, which we both know I'm much better at from the other side of the Atlantic.
Now vite, vite.
Sweet potato casserole with marshmallows and pecans! Yum! How that's a side dish and not a dessert, I will never know.
Serena, you have to see this new hotel in Turks and Caicos.
Bart and I are gonna practically be sleeping on the beach tonight.
You're not gonna be here for Thanksgiving? Well, after everything we went through with Charles' vendetta, Bart thought we could use a little R&R on Malcolm Beach.
Now I just need to find out where Laryssa stored my Missonis for the winter.
Try Eric's closet.
You know, this might actually be a good thing.
It'll just be the two of us.
or maybe we can invite everyone? We can invite Rufus, and since Bart's not here, we can invite Chuck and then Nate and then Blair.
I don't know.
I mean, it's our first Thanksgiving back together, and--and given our track record with Thanksgivings, it might be kinda risky.
Divorces have been filed, affairs revealed.
Yes, but that was our parents, not us.
Come on.
They're not even gonna be here.
Okay.
I mean, if it's what you really want, I'm in.
Thank you.
All right, so I'll go invite my dad and grab the world-famous Humphrey stuffing recipe.
Okay, well, I'll stop by Blair's, and then I'll go to the market and try to upgrade for a bigger bird.
Okay.
Back here in a couple hours? Perfect.
Where's monkey? I found his crying at my door comforting.
I had him from housekeeping take him for a walk.
Why? Because you were too busy reading up on new ways to betray your best friend? Chuck, you know how sorry I am.
Bart's threatening to send me to prison for cooking "The Spectator's" books.
And I don't want to hurt you again, so I've been going over these documents, just trying to figure a way out of this whole mess.
Good luck with that.
Bart Bass is a grand master of manipulation.
He has ruined me.
You'll be child's play.
My advice is to lie back and think of England.
Yeah, thanks for the help.
If I could defeat my father, do you think I'd be here drinking alone, unable to be with the woman I love? Maybe you should do some research into finding yourself a hot tub time machine so you can go back and undo your creative accounting.
Serena.
I'm so glad you're still here.
So my thanksgiving plans changed.
Let me guess.
Humphrey left you high and dry.
Not to worry.
I still have a free first class companion ticket to Paris for anyone other than Dorota.
What? It is not my fault that Vanya took the kids to Minsk.
No, Dan and I are great.
Actually, we decided to host thanksgiving together, and I need you there.
Miss Blair, Miss Eleanor is expecting you.
You made promise to her and to self.
Please, Blair, We really wanna spend thanksgiving with you, and I'm not gonna take no for answer.
Okay.
If that's what you really want, Then I, as your friend, will be there to make sure things run the way they should.
Yay! Okay,I already texted Nate.
Can you let Chuck know for me? Miss Blair giving Mr.
Chuck space.
Now that Paris is canceled, everything is changed.
Amazing.
Okay, I'm gonna go to Pellegrini's, and I'll see you soon.
What happened to no meddling this year?! Did you hear her? She is getting domestic with that wool-haired whiner.
Four major holidays stand between thanksgiving and Serena being a June bride.
Measures must be taken-- drastic measures.
Good to see you.
What do you want, Blair? Nothing.
Just to help those less fortunate, like I do every thanksgiving.
Unless, of course, you're no longer interested in Nate.
I am, but I'm not moronic enough to trust you to help me get him.
That's too bad because I think Serena and Dan's thanksgiving would be the perfect opportunity for you to reconnect.
Serena would never invite me.
She's not exactly thankful I screened her s*x tape for all of New York society.
You make a point, but Nate will never forgive you unless you undo the damage between S and your father.
Except that I don't want them together.
You said yourself that he's miserable without her.
And besides, she's Serena van der Woodsen.
He's a man.
He's probably gonna go back to her anyway.
So this just at least gives you the chance to date Nate Archibald.
Fine.
Tell me what to do.
Further instructions will come forth from my avatar--Dorota.
Shoo.
Go.
That's good.
Go ahead.
Georgina.
How's Philip? Quit the small talk, Humphrey.
Give me the pages.
That's gonna be tough since I already messengered the only hard copy to Graydon's assistant at home.
What? No one wants to read your vomit draft.
Why didn't you let me give you my notes first? Because you're not my editor.
I am your everything.
Don't you think I know exactly what's going on here? You started this chapter over the summer, skewering Serena, and then you moved in with her and you decided to write a sniveling Valentine in hopes she would fall madly in love with you.
From the beginning, my goal with this book was to tell the truth, and I haven't strayed from that.
So I'm sorry if you're upset, but you're just gonna have to wait for the chapter to go online tonight.
Philip, get me the home address of Graydon Carter's assistant.
I was just thinking about you.
You were? I'm still grocery shopping.
I think I may have overdone it a little.
Who doesn't love leftovers? I'm guessing that means everybody's in.
Yeah, they are.
Oh, my god! Serena! Hey! Let me call you back.
Serena.
Hi.
Hi.
Seeing you is the first thing I've been thankful for in weeks.
I owe you an apology.
Chuck.
Chuck, wake up.
Seriously, Chuck, wake up.
Bruce Caplan is dead.
The guy was a two-bit crook.
Who cares? You should.
I just got off the phone with his secretary.
Apparently, Bruce died only a few days after our last meeting.
He fell off the Bass Enterprises yacht.
Is there a point to this sob story? Your father probably figured out that it was Bruce who tipped us off to the microfilm in the painting.
Do you honestly think that Bart had nothing to do with his death? Even if he did, I promise you he covered his tracks or destroyed the evidence or had Lily do it for him.
Now get out of my room.
Seems like Bass is basking in his misery.
Looks like I'm not the only one who goes into hiding on thanksgiving.
Step aside.
Are you deaf? I said move it, buster! I'm sorry, Ms.
Waldorf, but Mr.
Bass gave us specific instructions.
You're no longer welcome at the Empire.
And this year's best dish is going to be served by yours truly.
So how's life been treating you since I treated you so badly? Better than I thought, honestly.
What about you? I'm good.
I just got back from Uganda.
We're supplying vitamins to all the hospitals there and He's been terrible.
Okay.
That's embarrassing, but maybe a-a little true.
I'm sorry.
We all know I have a knack for humiliating people.
Uh, excuse me.
Van der Woodsen.
Spence.
I'm--I'm really sorry about cotillion, too.
I kind of freaked out when I thought my dad loved you more than he loved me, but I realize now he loved us both.
And this just keeps getting more uncomfortable by the minute.
Yeah, I think that night was weird for all of us, but I'm glad that we have the holidays to have a fresh start.
Thank you.
Wow.
Looks like you got the last one.
Thanks.
Wow.
Are we really so pathetic that we're having a chicken on Thanksgiving? We were supposed to be in Amsterdam, but someone didn't finish her college applications.
I know, but doesn't that look so delicious? It's a raw turkey.
It looks disgusting, actually.
Um, but you know what? Nobody should spend Thanksgiving eating chicken alone.
So--so why don't you two join us for dinner? I mean, I-I think we can spare some turkey.
And--and the Van der Woodsens do have a long history of inviting bump-ins.
What the hell took you so long? And good morning to you, too, Blair.
Chuck banned me from the Empire? I mean, he's banished me before, but that was when we were on a s*x fast.
What do you want me to say? Chuck has hit bottom.
All he does now is drink in bed and argue with monkey.
Well, I had no idea it was that bad.
Yeah, it's bad.
He's even giving up on defeating Bart.
Well, that can't happen.
We can't let Bart win.
We have to reinspire him.
What do you think I've been trying to do? Chuck didn't even care when I told him that Bruce Caplan mysteriously drowned.
His dentist? No, that's Brad Caplan.
Bruce is the Bass business manager who apparently fell off Bart's yacht.
It's not a coincidence that one of the only people who knew about Bart's illegal oil trading died in a freak accident.
Especially since Sheikh Hassan, the man who sold Bart the oil, died in an accident, too.
I mean, maybe if we can connect the two, we can take that to the authorities.
Or at least get Lily to see who Bart really is.
I have an idea.
All I need is a wampum pouch, a push-up bra, and all of Bart's computer passwords.
Dan! Happy Thanksgiving.
You, too.
Dusting off the old 6-string.
I like it.
As a matter of fact, I'm on my way out to a benefit concert Lisa's throwing at the bandshell.
You should come with.
It's a hormone-free potluck.
That sounds tempting, but I'm here to invite you to a Lily-free dinner that Serena and I are hosting at the Van der Woodsens'.
Jenny told me you two were back together last time we skyped.
You can say it.
I know.
I know you disapprove.
I guess I'm just surprised you haven't learned by now.
Uh, learned--learned what? That we Humphrey men don't stand a real chance when it comes to Van der Woodsen women.
Is this the speech where you tell me that we're from different worlds? Because, you know, I-I did--I wrote the book.
Two, actually.
Women like Lily and Serena are never gonna respect guys like us.
All the love songs I wrote Lily made no difference.
Poetry isn't what she wants.
No matter how much we love Lily and Serena, they're always gonna choose guys like Bart Bass.
So maybe the trick is to become Bart Bass.
Yeah, but neither of us could ever do that.
And that's a good thing.
Bart's cold and calculating.
A reptile.
Yeah, well, that snake is spending Thanksgiving with Lily, and you're not.
I should go.
Daphne, right? Graydon's assistant at "Vanity Fair"? Georgina Sparks.
We've spoken on the phone ad nauseam.
I just got off the phone with Dan Humphrey.
I'm done working on Thanksgiving.
Daphne, I, of all people, understand the challenge facing a young mother in the big city.
I, too, have a little rug rat, and it is a constant struggle to balance family and career.
So, please, mother to mother, I need to see a copy of Dan's Serena chapter.
You know that I'm not allowed to give out copies of writer's submissions.
Now if you don't mind Oh.
But I do mind.
Why don't you make it easy on yourself and your little bed-wetter and just give me a sneak peek? No.
Ask Dan if you wanna read his Serena chapters.
Chapters? There's more than one? I thought we were done, but he just sent me something else.
Did somebody order a Thanksgiving spread? You just cost my dim-witted doorman his holiday bonus.
Ohh.
Don't blame him.
I said you called for a stripper, and obviously I'm a convincing one.
I've come to kidnap you and bring you to Serena and Dan's Thanksgiving.
I'm not going anywhere, but you are, unless you want me to call security.
Don't be a grumpy gus.
Bart and Lily won't be there.
Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.
What part of our last conversation did you not understand? As long as I can't defeat my father, we can never be together.
Just because we can't live happily ever after doesn't mean that we can't have a little fun once in a while.
We made a pact.
Need I remind you what that means? But it's been too long since Monaco.
Pocahontas needs her John Smith.
I always thought of myself as more of a John Rolfe kind of man.
That's my Chuck.
You can play both after dinner.
And you're sure Lily and Bart are gone? They are, and now so is my appetite.
When was the last time you showered? Only if you join me.
Something smells divine.
Oh, that would be Dorota's candied yams.
Aren't you two supposed to be on a white sand beach where no one pays capital gains tax? Tropical storm.
Our flight was delayed.
So it looks like we'll be staying for dinner after all, if we're not imposing.
Uh, no.
No, not at all.
I mean, we have plenty of food.
We'll just We're gonna need to change up the seating arrangements.
Mom, you're here.
Well, we got rained out.
Darling, you went grocery shopping.
I'm so proud.
Looks like we're gonna need to set two more places.
Um, actually, make that four.
Look who I ran into at the grocery store.
Blair's plan worked perfectly.
Eh.
Oh.
How are you? Mmm.
Yum.
Why are you mad? I didn't decide to close the airport.
Lily and Bart are the least of my concerns.
Oh, you're mad that I invited Steven to dinner.
No, no, I'm thrilled that you invited your ex to our Thanksgiving dinner.
I was hoping maybe Ben or Colin or Carter could stop by later for apple crostata.
Oh, come on, Dan.
I only invited them because they had nowhere else to go.
What would you have done? Called you, given you a heads-up.
In an equal partnership, you're supposed to take the other person's feelings into consideration.
I'm sorry.
But it just-- it happened so quickly.
And honestly, I didn't think you'd care.
That you invited the guy you were ready to get engaged to at cotillion? Why are you being so insecure? Look I'm fine that your ex is here.
'cause you invited her.
But we're together now.
I think your stuffing's burning.
I'm so glad you two could make it.
Yeah, everything looks wonderful.
Doesn't everything look wonderful? The bar certainly does.
He'll perk up.
He's just dehydrated.
And is that your old beau looking more handsome than ever? It's so generous of you and Dan to invite him to your thanksgiving.
I'm not sure Dan feels the same way.
What are they Tropical storm.
Hopefully Chuck can hold his tongue until after the pie? Have you seen Nate? No, not yet.
Charles? Lily.
What are you doing here? I live here, and I'm hoping that your presence today means that you're going to apologize to your father and put this feud behind you.
The problem with putting Bart behind me is that then he can stab me in the back.
Who invited him? Well, it is Thanksgiving.
Let's try to have a nice meal together.
I think now Charles has no evidence against you, so he can't hurt you anymore.
I'd like to make sure of that.
I know I'm the last person you expected to see today, but my dad and I ran into serena at the grocery store.
And she couldn't help but adopt a couple of strays for Thanksgiving.
Pretty much.
So can we talk? Don't worry.
I'm not pregnant.
I just miss you.
Sage, look, now isn't-- Nathaniel.
You know what? On second thought, right now is a great time.
We'll go upstairs.
Dan, right? Steven.
I hope there's more than one place card for "Serena's ex.
" Uh, y-you know what? I'm actually not Serena's ex anymore.
You're kidding? No, no, no.
This is--this is our Thanksgiving dinner together.
Well, enjoy it, because I have a feeling it'll be your last.
What? Do you need me to spell it out for you? The s*x tape blew up, I broke up with her, and then she ran to you because she's terrified to be alone.
Y-you don't know anything about Serena.
Or I-I'm sorry.
Do you still think her name is Sabrina? I know that she needs someone to take care of her, and I know you can't.
Oh, yeah, but you and your Omega-3 empire can? Well, I did all summer, and we were great together.
I think we still could be.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Masterful work, Dorota.
If things continue to progress at this rate, Humphrey will be gone by tomorrow.
Chuck, where are you going? If you think tricking me into making up with my father is going to allow us to be together, you're mistaken.
I have to defeat him.
Bruce Caplan and the Sheikh are both dead.
That--that can't be a coincidence.
I have a plan.
How many times do I have to tell you Bart is not stupid enough to leave any evidence? We don't need a smoking gun.
We just need a single thread to tie the two deaths together.
Bruce Caplan was on your father's yacht.
And--and maybe the Sheikh was on his way to see Bart.
Or maybe Bart had sent the car.
Well, that kind of information could be hiding in the open.
A leasing agreement, a logbook.
But the--the FBI aren't gonna take a circumstantial theory.
The only person we need to convince that Bart is a murderer is Lily.
And Lily's been by his side at every turn.
Lily could care less about an oil embargo or a faked death.
But a real one? Or two? If only we could get onto the Bass industries server But we need a password.
And if only I had texted your uncle Jack to do a little bribing and blackmailing to get them.
And if only Nate was upstairs right now, trying them all.
You're amazing.
I know.
Now go see if he's found anything.
Hey, Dominick dummy.
Georgina.
No van der woodsen family holiday would be complete without you.
Keep your flattery in your pants.
I know you sent in two Serena chapters to "Vanity fair."
I did.
They're both the truth, And I'm still not showing you either.
I don't need to read them.
Obviously one is the stupid Serena serenade that you've been composing since ninth grade, And the other is the piercing expose that you started to write over the summer.
Don't be an idiot.
Do you wanna win, or do you just wanna win Serena? Serena? Dinner's ready.
There is no winning without Serena.
Dinner's ready.
Daphne, it's Dan.
Hi.
Uh, yeah, I've decided which chapter I wanna publish.
Oh, Dorota, this looks amazing.
I may need to have a second plate! Oh! And the toasted almonds are such a lovely surprise.
Speaking of surprises, I was so sorry to hear about Bruce Caplan's passing.
Uh, w--I had no idea.
What happened? He was so young.
Drowning.
He was sailing on the Bass yacht and just fell overboard in broad daylight.
You'd think someone would've jumped in to save him.
My god.
How tragic for his family.
And for Bruce.
It's odd that Bart never mentioned it.
You know, I-I wanted to thank you again for inviting us.
It--it means a lot to Sage and to me.
Yeah, of course.
I-I'm sorry.
I feel terrible though.
Up you have enough to eat.
I forgot you're gluten-free.
I'll be fine.
You know, I-I-I'm more concerned about you.
Why? I eat everything.
No, I-I'm talking about you getting back together with Dan.
You know, I-I know I hurt you, but I mean, this kinda represents everything you said you were trying to escape from.
I mean, he wrote all those horrible articles about you and your friends.
Yeah, but he didn't write one about me.
I know that Dan has made his mistakes, but so have I.
Me, too.
The biggest being pushing you away.
I'm still in love with you, Serena.
We deserve another chance.
I'm sorry, but I'm in love with Dan.
You're not.
He's your rebound from me.
No, you were my rebound from him.
I left the city Because I thought he wanted to be with Blair.
But Dan is my first love.
He'll always be.
You know, maybe I got it right at cotillion after all.
Steven Nate, I came up here to make out, not to watch you and Chuck play wikileaks.
This isn't gonna work.
It has to be at least nine characters.
Try this.
ParkAve740 There's nothing confidential here.
It's all just general files.
Doesn't matter.
Just look for travel and living expenses, leasing agreements, anything overseas.
Hey, just give us a second.
Give me 30, and I'll leave you alone.
Amuse the young lady, Nathaniel.
I've got this.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Go.
Admit you missed me.
It's okay.
I don't care if you watch.
She's a keeper, Nate.
And, yes, I can attest to the fact that he missed you, everything has really fallen apart for him since you two broke up.
Yeah, so I should probably help Chuck.
I did something that I'm not too proud of-- Wait.
I think I've got something.
It isn't line-caught blue marlin, But it doesn't look half-bad.
Lily? I just heard about Bruce Caplan.
Yes.
Tragic news.
Who told you? Speaking of bruce, I heard he drowned like a rock.
or at least had them tied to his ankles.
Charles, show some respect.
Yeah, maybe we should take a moment to remember Bruce, who died falling off your yacht.
And Sheikh Hassan, whose Bass industries-provided car burst into flames.
I hate it when that happens.
Bart, is that true? I have no idea what kind of car he was driving.
Oh, I think Chuck could shed some light on that.
Right? Bentley W12, provided by Bass enterprises.
The leasing agreement, hot off the press.
So what if we provided the Sheikh's cars? We're certainly not responsible for every mechanical malfunction.
So it's just a coincidence that the two men who could've sent you to prison happen to die in transportation you so generously provided them? If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna freshen up.
If you done with problem number one, problem number two needs meddling.
Have you noticed Mr.
Steven has left? I'll be right back.
Hey, thank you again for postponing Paris.
Did I see Steven leave? Yes.
Do you know that he tried to get back together with me? Well, you must be in seventh heaven.
Deciding to take the evening apart to consider it? B, you know that Dan's the one.
I've been holding my tongue because we're finally friends again.
And, the only thing I care about is that you are happy and in love.
But Dan Humphrey is not the one.
I don't want to lose our friendship again either, so I'd appreciate it if you didn't say any more.
He is a self-promoting hipster weasel who's thrown every one of his friends under the bus, and I'm not going to sit by and wait for him to do it to you, too.
I know in your twisted but loving way you're trying to be protective.
But you're wrong about Dan.
So please just accept him, and this'll be the best Thanksgiving ever.
Lily, please.
This is just another one of Chuck's games.
When I asked you about the oil deal, you promised me that no one got hurt.
And no one did.
At least not by me.
So Bruce and the Sheikh's death were just pure coincidence? Yes.
Are you questioning me? Maybe I should start.
All I did was protect you.
By lying to me.
I never lied to you.
I told you, no one got hurt.
You're hurting me right now.
Chuck is just getting to you, and he won't stop until I make him.
I just wanna thank you all for joining us for our first Thanksgiving together as a couple.
Even Georgina, who I didn't actually invite.
But welcome.
So to many more years of love, happiness, and good friends.
Cheers.
I, too, have something to be grateful for freedom of the press.
If you'll all take a look at your phones, you will soon realize that my protege Daniel Humphrey has just released the latest installment of his serial a chapter on our very own Serena.
The right chapter, thank you very much.
What's she talking about? "Serena Van Der Woodsen-- golden girl falls from grace.
" "A faux love story.
" "Serena is nothing.
She's a golden shell.
Give her love, and she'll do anything you want.
" Serena, I know you're upset.
"With Daddy issues like these, "It's not hard to push the right buttons.
"And once you do, "The most powerful girl on the upper east side has no power at all.
" I understand if you would've written this in the spring.
you were so mad at me then.
But why would you write this now? Why--why not write it now? It's no less true than it was then.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I must be confused.
I mean, has everything that's happened since cotillion been a lie? The--the vespa? The bar? Did--did you ask someone to stop the elevator? Vanya.
I told him I was trying to win you back.
But everything I've said about how I feel is the truth.
No, that's that's not possible.
That doesn't make sense.
You couldn't say these things about me if you loved me.
I invited you into my home, Dan, and my world, and--and then you just humiliate me.
That is the issue.
It's "My world" Oh, come on.
It's a figure of speech.
No, it has always been your world, and you've never let me forget it.
I've always been a visitor-- the poor kid from Brooklyn who you've never seen as an equal to you.
Okay, so this is your payback? Do you feel better about riding the subway to school since you made a fool of me and everyone? What I did is no worse than what all your friends do to each other every day.
You try to ruin each other, and then you sit down for Thanksgiving and you call yourselves family.
You were supposed to be different.
I used to be.
Got me nowhere.
So now I'm the same.
Good-bye, Dan.
Are you okay? I don't know.
But you can gloat.
You were right.
For the first time ever, I'm sorry I was.
Well, 90% sorry.
Thanksgiving is ruined once again.
Are you kidding? What is Thanksgiving without a side of drama? And pie.
Apple or pumpkin? Both.
Lily.
I'm fine.
I, I just need some fresh air.
Maybe you should sit down.
I can get you a glass of water.
Oh, Charles, I forgot how sweet you are.
The only thing that matters is that you finally know the truth.
I do, and I'm sorry.
What on earth do you have to be sorry for? For believing all of your lies.
No.
Actually, I was just going to tell Charles how sorry I am for trying to force a reconciliation between the two of you.
I know that will never happen, and I should have accepted it sooner.
Happy Thanksgiving to you, too, Lily.
I promise it'll get better.
Nate and I survived both our chapters.
It didn't work.
Hey, Dan, before you go That was from all of us.
Daniel.
I just wanted to say I was impressed with your latest literary offering.
You've restored my faith in your generation.
If you ever need anything, give a call.
Do not leave me alone with them.
The last time I attended a shunning, I froze my zhopa off in Siberia.
Oh, it can get just as cold around here.
You think they hate me? They fear you.
Welcome to the upper east side.
Mind if I join you? Not at all.
It's been a trying night.
I was thinking about taking a few days at Miraval, If you don't mind.
Sounds like a perfect idea.
What's wrong? Who called? Mm.
Nobody.
Oh.
Okay, we need to work on your poker face.
You're not fooling anyone.
Mmm.
Like Chuck said, it hasn't been a great time for me.
Okay.
So? Tell me what's going on.
Who was on the phone? Look.
It was Bart Bass.
A few months ago, I made a mistake with "The spectator" finances.
You know, the kind that sends you to prison.
Bart knows, and he's using it as blackmail to turn me against Chuck.
Well, there must be some way out of it.
No, there isn't, Because I'm guilty.
And if you wanna leave now, then I totally understand.
Are you kidding? Now you're the good guy and the bad boy.
I'm not going anywhere.
They kicked you out, didn't they? I saw your piece on Serena.
You let me off easy by comparison.
All I did was tell the truth.
Your truth.
Everybody has a version, or way of delivering it.
It wouldn't have been my choice.
Well, maybe that's why Lily doesn't respect you.
So is this how you become Bart Bass? I did what I had to do.
And tonight, for the first time, they weren't looking down on me.
They might've hated me, but I was one of them.
Congratulations I guess.
So now that you've achieved that, you can come back to Brooklyn.
What I want isn't in Brooklyn, dad.
I have a plan.
I have this whole time and it's working.
Lily, I've had all the stepmothering I can handle for one day.
Charles, please listen to me.
I'm a fool for trusting your father all this time.
That's what I was trying to apologize to you for before-- Bart interrupted.
I'm on my way to Miraval for a week, and I'm scared to be around your father, and I fear he's coming after you, too.
I'm well aware.
Unfortunately, I think there is little I can do to stop him.
Bruce Caplan and the Sheikh's deaths won't stick in court without hard evidence, and you made s'mores of all the financial records.
Not before I carefully read each film with Cece's jewler's loupe.
She always said that was the best way to catch a husband in a lie.
I know she was referring to low-grade diamonds, but still I'll send you everything I can remember.
Thank you.
It's the least I can do.
Charles Be safe.
Nathaniel, remember when I said would ask for your help in the future? Meet me at my office first thing tomorrow.
Unless, of course, you'd rather a wake-up call from the FEDS.
I'll be there.
Thanksgiving may be over, But I hear that our favorite upper east siders are still cooking something up.
And pretty soon, everyone is going to feel the heat.
Of course, when you fan an old flame, sometimes you wind up just getting burned and having to start from scratch.
I just got your text.
What happened? Lily has finally seen the light.
She's going to help me take down Bart.
Will you go to war with me? I thought you'd never ask.
Luckily, the things that have been slowly simmering always taste the most satisfying.
Bon appetit.

Gossip Girl here your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Daniel Humphrey has just released the latest installment of his serial a chapter on our very own Serena.
Why would you write this now? You were supposed to be different.
What I want isn't in Brooklyn, dad.
I have a plan.
I have this whole time.
You are indebted to me.
You're gonna help me defeat Chuck.
Meet me at my office first thing tomorrow.
Unless, of course, you'd rather a wake-up call from the feds.
He is a ruthless criminal.
There is nothing to stop him from hurting anyone, including you.
I told you, no one got hurt.
You're hurting me right now.
Lily has finally seen the light.
She's going to help me take down Bart.
Will you go to war with me? I thought you'd never ask.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.

Presented by Page Senegal - Step right up, ladies and gentlemen! Alors, you place the orange under your neck, and you pass it to the player right next to you but without using your hands.
Alors un, deux, et trois.
Mrs.
Bass? Who are you? Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs.
Bass? Tell me what? Any morning now, he could wake up dead.
Leave me alone! Dead, Mrs.
Bass, like last week's news.
Dorota, it's time! Wakey, wakey! Let's hope in this nightmare, father doesn't know best.
This is the one.
This hovel? You're flush with cash from your movie deal.
Look.
Nikki Finke put your picture up next to Harvey's.
You should be looking for a soundproof room and a bidet and a guest bath.
What are you talking about? I don't I don't need a bidet.
It's for me.
Oh.
Well, now I'll never be able to set foot in the guest bath without first thinking of your Geor-Gina.
But you're not moving in here, so you can check your fantasies at the door.
What happened to Philip? Something happened to Philip? Well What? I am a highly sought after talent manager now.
I cannot be expected to live in a lesser borough.
And Philip loves Brooklyn and he has his little daddy and me classes every Tuesday in Fort Green.
You're delusional.
This is great.
I'll take it solo.
Great.
Great.
The only thing is that the co-op board of this building is particularly stringent, so if you want in, you'll have to get a good reference.
Right.
Lily, I have researched all the names and numbers you gave me from Bart's offshore accounts.
I can't pull up the records without the pass codes.
Do you recall any of those? I'm sorry, Charles.
I gave you all the information I have.
Okay.
Well, thank you.
I appreciate your help.
Unfortunately, I need something more.
I better go.
I'm late for my bamboo oat body smoother.
Good luck, darling.
Lily's information is useless without the P.
I.
N.
numbers.
We have no hard evidence Bart illegally traded oil.
Well, it's too bad.
Tonight's gala would've been the perfect time to strike, with the city's most prominent eyes upon him.
Man of the year.
What a charade.
That's it.
What's it? A charade.
Lily's information may not be enough to convict Bart, but it may be enough to bluff a confession out of him.
I can't put Lily in danger, he cannot know she was the one who told me about the accounts.
But what if Lily didn't do it? Are you on some diet I should know about? Huh? You literally just tossed a cookie.
I go to Constance.
I know an eating disorder when I see one.
No, it's more like nerves.
I have my daily meeting with Bart Bass.
Well, if the stress is driving you to manorexia, maybe you should skip it.
Yeah, right.
Only reason Bart's not sending me to jail is because I'm being his mole with Chuck.
I mean, I don't know how Claire danes does it.
Spying hurts me head, okay? Well, maybe he'll get sick of these meetings soon enough.
That's doubtful, and the only thing he hates more than Chuck is tardiness, so I'm gonna go.
Hey, Marshall, it's Serena.
Uh, let me know if you hear of any sublets or productions that need an extra hand.
I'll be in L.
A.
tomorrow.
Bye.
Serena! Oh.
It is a mess in here.
Oh.
Yeah, I'm just purging my closet.
Ah.
A post-Dan cleanse.
It's just what the doctor ordered, and a little distraction.
Which is exactly what we have for you.
Is this about Bart? Yeah, my mom called and told me everything.
It sounds like it's gotten pretty scary.
Which is why we need to stop him.
But in order to do that, we have to elicit a confession.
And make him believe we have proof for his crimes.
Okay, but how can I help? Well, the last person to be seen with that microfilm in her grimy little paw was Ivy Dickens.
But her cell's been disconnected and she hasn't been spotted on "Gossip Girl" for weeks.
She's probably at Cece's Hamptons house.
That's the place she went the last time she disappeared.
Why don't we, uh, get her back here? Hello? Hey, Ivy.
It's Serena.
Yeah, I know.
I can afford caller I.
D.
You know, I've been doing some thinking, and and I realized that my family treated you horribly.
True.
But why apologize now? I don't know.
I guess since Dan humiliated me, I have a new appreciation for friendship.
So why don't we met at the Oak Room around noon? And, uh, we can chat over lunch.
Fine.
And there are some things I wanna talk to you about as well.
Great.
Bye.
She's in.
Hey, William, I might not be here when you get back.
But you'll be excited to know that your daughter and I are working on smoothing things over.
Per your instructions, I swiped Chuck's phone.
Well done, grasshopper.
He had breakfast with Blair at Rosemary this morning and has a hotel management meeting later this afternoon.
Isn't this getting a little bit dull for you? My ennui is of no concern to you.
I will not be caught off guard by Chuck's antics while I'm being feted at tonight's event.
Yeah, fine.
Well, the only other thing I noticed was that he called Ivy Dickens a few times.
Don't try to tell me you all wanna be friends.
We don't.
I called you here under false pretenses.
We need your help with a mission we have against Bart Bass.
Are you kidding? I was locked in a room with Bart Bass.
He's dangerous.
Yes, he is, and you aggravated him with your topless antics and missing microfilm.
So if you ever wanna safely return to New York, he needs to be taken care of.
Well, if I knew how, I would've done it.
We need you to be the goat.
Don't tell me you've never studied medieval warfare.
When the Byzantines wanted to lure a dragon from its cave, they tied a goat to a stick.
You wanna tie me up and leave me somewhere? It's a metaphor.
We're going to use you and the copies you made of the microfilm as bait.
But I didn't make any copies.
As far as Bart's concerned, you did.
It all went according to plan.
That's probably Bart calling you now.
Start talking.
I heard you're back in town.
Where are you? Um The Oak Room.
Ah.
Coincidentally, I'm around the corner, and I have time for a chat.
He's on his way.
The microfilm had the records of Bart's illegal oil trade.
As long as you get him talking, he's bound to say something that links him to his crimes.
And make sure to record everything he says on your phone.
Nathaniel Archibald, you're under arrest for fraud.
Wait.
What? Come with me, sir.
Poor Nate.
Playing the double agent got him into double the trouble.
And now that Bart's wise to this guy, the question is, who will he outsmart next? Thank you.
My lawyers are doing everything in their power to have him released as soon as possible.
Well, obviously Bart figured out that Nate was playing him.
And then he started using Nate as his goat.
Am I the only one who didn't study Byzantine warfare? He thinks having Nate arrested will force me to go to him to make a deal.
Well, if that's what he wants, don't give in.
I'm not about to let Nate rot in jail.
I have to go to the apartment and see what he proposes.
Will you go with him? Bart's less likely to pull anything if someone else is on the premises.
Of course.
Chuck? After you.
Well, that's my cue to leave, too.
Not so fast.
You are not going anywhere.
We might need you as leverage.
You're coming with me.
So what can I do for you, Daniel? Well, um I have I've found an apartment that I'm interested in buying.
Recently, I've had some trouble lending money to my son's friends.
No.
No, I'm not here for a loan.
For the first time ever, in fact, I have plenty of money.
But I need a sponsor to vouch for me for the co-op board, and I know your name carries a lot of weight in New York real estate.
Well, unlike my son, it's nice to see someone recognizes my stature in this town.
You couldn't find a better sponsor than New York real estate's man of the year.
That's right.
I hear congratulations are in order.
Thank you.
You know, I've been assigned a reporter to do a profile on me in conjunction with the event.
Maybe you would like the opportunity instead? Profiles are my specialty.
Good.
Then it's settled.
You write nice things about me, I'll write you a great recommendation.
If you'll excuse me, I have some family business to attend to.
But I look forward to working with you.
I'm I'm glad to see you.
I've been trying to reach you since Thanksgiving.
Oh, yeah, and I've been ignoring your calls, your e-mails, and your texts.
Serena, please.
Just let me explain.
Explain what? That you're best friends with Bart Bass? Congratulations.
You've officially joined the dark side.
Okay, I'm here.
I know that's why you had Nate arrested.
So tell me, what's it gonna take to get you to drop the charges? It's quite simple, actually.
Stop your witch hunt and leave New York for Moscow tonight alone.
Moscow? As in Russia? It's lovely place.
Real estate market is booming.
Lots of opportunities for a young entrepreneur like yourself.
And how long do you expect me to live in exile? Forever.
You can never come back to New York.
That's not a deal.
That's a different kind of prison sentence.
I will find another way to get Nate out of jail.
There is no other way.
Don't you get it? I'm very close friends with the police commissioner.
The only person who can get Nate out of jail is me.
We'll see how powerful you are when you are locked inside with him.
If you want to go to Chuck, go.
You can trust me.
You were right.
I need to help you get rid of Bart if I wanna come back to New York to be with the man that I love.
We have a pact, just like you and Chuck.
Rufus? What kind of cockamamie love pact did you make with Rufus? It's not Rufus, although I'm not at liberty to name names at this time.
Really? 'Cause I'm just dying to know.
Oh, no.
The samples just came in and they are a disaster.
I have to go back to the atelier.
Don't answer your phone unless it's me, and do not move off that couch.
Dorota will be able to tell if there are fresh footprints on the Aubusson.
I saw your picture all over the news.
What happened? Bart figured out I was playing both sides, and this is his way of retaliating.
How are you doing? Well better now that you're here.
TMZ leaked your mug shot, and you actually look pretty cute.
Well, cute is gonna help me now.
I spoke with Chuck's lawyers, and they haven't made any progress in getting me out on bail.
Well, I know you don't trust your grandfather or anyone from the Van Der Bilt side of the family, so I called someone who has some experience with this kind of situation.
Dad? Why are you stopping? Hello?! Are you deaf? Will you give me a hand signal? I I speak fluent sign.
What the hell are you doing?! Taking you for a little ride.
Looking for me? Where's Blair? She texted me and said she's here.
If you've done something Blair is fine, okay? She's upstairs in the atelier, unharmed.
She's fine because I decided she could be fine.
Maybe next time I make a different decision.
So perhaps you'd like to reconsider my earlier offer? Are you threatening Blair with physical harm? Me? No.
I wouldn't hurt a fly.
But I'm not God.
I can't help it if accidents happen.
This fight is between me and you.
Leave everyone else out of it.
If you want your best friend to get out of jail, your stepmother to enjoy her happy marriage, your girlfriend to continue making her pretty little dresses then a new life on the other side of the world is your only option.
The Bass jet is waiting on the tarmac.
Go to Moscow tonight, then everyone you love will be safe.
I spoke to your lawyers.
The judge is refusing to set bail.
This can't be happening.
You're clearly being victimized because of the mistakes I've made in the past.
Now don't worry.
It'll all get sorted out.
No, it won't, dad.
I did it.
I'm guilty.
Nate.
You've always done the right thing.
I can't believe you'd do something like this.
Although, after the example I set for ya, I suppose I only have myself to blame.
This was all me.
I fudged the numbers to try and save "The Spectator.
" So you slipped.
You've always stood by me.
It's my turn to stand by you.
We'll go to the lender, explain everything to them, pay them whatever you owe.
They'll drop the charges.
No.
The only person that can drop the charges is Bart Bass, and he won't budge.
Dorota, the samples were pristine.
It was a false alarm merely Bart Bass fanning the flames.
So make sure that Ivy's ass stays glued to that couch cushion.
Ugh! Yes, this is Blair Waldorf.
Apparently, my town car has been absconded by a ruthless billionaire.
So if you'd please send another preferably with a different, less devious driver No.
No, what do you mean? I'm not still in the car.
I'm right here.
Why? Where'd it go? Thank you.
You seem engrossed.
Oh, I am.
Normally, I don't go for romance novels, but, uh the way you describe Serena Where'd you get that? A package came this afternoon.
Thinking it was your profile on me, I opened it.
Yeah, well, uh, I wrote two versions of the Serena chapter, and that's that's the nice one.
I prefer the nasty one you published.
I'm not sure that was the best decision.
Why not? When I was staying here with Serena, I do you wanna hear this? Mm-hmm.
I was trying to make her fall in love with me so I could write the ultimate expose bringing down the golden girl.
But while I was busy trying to win her affections, I realized I was still in love with her.
And wrote this nonsense.
I would've published it, too, but, uh, but on Thanksgiving, I realized that Serena was never gonna take me seriously unless I could show her that I wasn't afraid of her, that I didn't think she was better than me.
Bravo.
You made the right decision.
Yeah, but she won't speak to me now.
Let your father serve as a cautionary tale, Daniel.
He's sitting over there in Brooklyn alone, while I'm here married to Lily.
Serena respects you now, even if she doesn't know it.
You stay the course, she will come around in time.
That was the idea, but it's, uh, it's taking a little longer than I expected.
Well hopefully, you have a few more days until she moves to Los Angeles.
Los Angeles? Chuck! Stop! What are you doing? I couldn't live with myself if anything happened to you.
But I'm fine.
Because I'm leaving.
It's a small price to pay for your safety.
But I don't want to be safe.
I wanna be with you.
Come on.
Let's go together.
I'll have Dorota send my things.
Blair, I can't.
I have to go alone.
I made a deal.
Those were my father's terms.
Just have faith in me, this one last time.
But I I've waited too long.
I need to be with you now.
Blair, trust me.
Letting me go is the right thing to do.
No.
Don't get on the plane.
Bart has already hurt so many people.
I know what my father's capable of, but he would never try to kill his own son.
Then do one thing before you go.
Kiss me, Chuck Bass.
I have called you all here because you are the most conniving group of scammers and schemers that I know.
And, Serena, you're my best friend.
Thanks for clarifying.
I still don't understand why Georgina's here, though.
You can't have an evil cabal without the queen of con.
And frankly, I should've been given more notice.
You lost your royal status when I took your phone at cotillion.
Ha.
Phone stealing? Seriously? That's the training bra of treachery.
Enough! If I wanted infighting, I would've called my minions.
Now I need her here.
I need you all here to use your dastardly skills to take down Bart Bass.
Yeah, but last time we did that, Nate ended up in jail.
Do you want to go back to being the goat or lend your impersonation prowess to my plan? Blair, are you sure Chuck would want you involved in his war? It's not his choice.
Now I want you all to get Bart talking.
And record him on your phones.
We'll merge your master manipulations, your wanton disregard for authority, and your brilliance at playing dumb.
Bart Bass may be able to fool the FBI, but he has never had to face off against Blair Waldorf and her bitches.
Bart, hey.
My mom wanted me to tell you she's so sorry she can't be here to celebrate your accomplishments.
Well, all all this does seem rather impressive, doesn't it? Yeah.
Hey, maybe you can show her the slide show when she returns.
I'm sure she'd love to see your travels.
Is everything okay? I don't remember approving that slide.
Well, obviously someone likes it.
Obviously, there's a glitch in the system.
If you'll excuse me Have you gotten this evening's program? You look even more dashing in it than you do in person.
Well, at least they followed my instructions regarding this part of the presentation.
Tell me the truth, do you trade on your good looks to get all your adoring donors? How did you get Lady Alexander to give so much, and twice on Sundays I bet she really put you through your paces.
Did you give this to anyone else? No.
Oh.
Unless you count everybody here.
Whatever it is you're trying to pull, I'm putting a stop to it.
Great job on stealing the dead guy's phone.
Now just keep calling Bart until he cracks.
I'm gonna start phase two.
Yeah, I know.
Serena, there you are.
Dan.
What are you doing here? Oh, wait! I forgot.
You're honoring your new mentor Bart Bass.
If you'll excuse me, I need to be anywhere but here.
Just tell me if you are really leaving town.
What do you care? You can just as easily write despicable things about me from afar.
I know you're mad, but that chapter's not the only thing I've written about you.
The the most flattering things I've written about anyone have been about you, too.
Oh, okay, that was five years ago.
Since then, I've been the empty-headed blonde in "Inside," and and the golden girl with daddy issues in "Inside Out.
" Your writing changed, and so did you.
That's no reason to leave your entire world behind.
My world turned you from a person with integrity into a cruel satirist.
I mean, you're worse than gossip girl.
At least she has a conscience.
No matter what it looks like, I'm still on your side, Serena.
I always have been.
Yeah, well, excuse me if I don't wait around to be disappointed again.
I'm moving to L.
A.
Just as soon as I'm done helping Blair with Bart, which you should be doing, too, but you're on his side.
Hire more staff if you have to.
I will not be embarrassed at my own party.
Okay.
Excuse me, sir.
Would you like a cocktail? We have a lovely Sudanese vodka.
What the hell are you doing here? Just a waitress trying to serve you a drink, which you look like you could use.
Lily destroyed what was inside of this already.
Hmm.
Or did I make copies? You never know which one of these has what you're looking for.
Bart? There you are.
Perhaps you remember my very special guest Iman Hassan? You did some oil dealings with her father.
It's lovely to see you, Iman.
Although I never did any business with your father.
We were simply good friends.
Who shared a love of horses.
Yes, that's right.
How is her dear Lady Alexander living out her days at your horse farm? Grazing away happily, I should think.
I know what you did to my horse.
Did you murder my father, too? I loved your father like a brother.
If you'll excuse us, Iman we need a moment.
Oh.
Tell security where I am.
I wouldn't want to go mysteriously missing.
I know what you're trying to doing with the envelopes and the phony phone calls.
I've seen "a Christmas Carol.
" The classic tale of misdeeds haunting a man who didn't remedy them.
You know, I've always felt that scrooge was unfairly maligned.
He simply expected people to act like adults.
And in other news There is no Santa Claus, Ms.
Waldorf.
Owned and operated by Bass Industries.
The G2 was reported missing off the coast of Maine.
Wait.
Turn that up.
Sure.
The coast guard is investigating the area where the plane went off the radar after sending a mayday signal.
Oh, no.
I hope that wasn't the one Chuck was on.
At present, there was no communication from the plane.
A search and rescue operation is currently underway to identify victims.
Good evening.
My name is Jason Pomeranc, and I'm the chairman and founder of Thompson Hotels.
I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome you all to New York real estate's man of the year award.
That's my cue.
The exact number of passengers aboard the plane is still uncertain.
We'll bring you more information as it becomes available.
And in other news Bart Bass has been a boon to Manhattan's skyline.
To truly introduce him properly, it's my honor to present the number one chronicler of Manhattan's elite Mr.
Daniel Humphrey.
I would like to introduce an icon of New York real estate and a pillar of our community.
He is the center of the Bass family and he's a personal inspiration to me.
Please welcome Charles Bass.
Thank you.
Thank you.
My father is being honored here as a humanitarian, but the last time I checked, humanitarians value human life and he just tried to have his own son killed.
Isn't that why you look so surprised? You put me on that plane to die? Looks like Chuck found the emergency exit at 10,000 feet.
Let's hope he can avoid going six feet under again.
I would like to apologize for my son's outburst.
As many of you here know, he has long struggled with substance abuse.
I have already contacted the Pedowitz Institute, and I can only hope that he will accept the help that he so desperately needs.
Please, let's not let him ruin this otherwise festive evening.
Thank you, everybody.
I overestimated you.
You're just lucky that security is getting Chuck home to his suite before he can do any more damage.
At least you know Chuck's okay.
I still despise you, but thank you for doing the right thing for once.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Do you know where Serena went? Why would I tell you, even if I did? So you can con her into falling in love with you and humiliate her again? No, I was hoping after my speech that maybe she would change her mind about me and about leaving town.
I really hope that you're referring to a vacation spot too elite for the likes of you.
No, I'm talking about L.
A.
, for good.
I retract everything civil I just said.
This is all your fault.
If Serena moves away, I will never forgive you, Humphrey.
I think it's terrific, and I thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Let me guess.
Prison overcrowding, or did they let the both of you out on good behavior? My son never should've been behind bars in the first place.
But look at how the two of you have bonded over it, so you're welcome.
Okay, you've had your fun.
Now what will it take for you to get your name off my loan document so I can own my paper again? See, that's the problem with this generation.
They're so entitled.
They don't even say "please.
" Nate worked his ass off to build that paper.
He never asked you to cosign for him and he's not asking for charity now.
We'll pay whatever it's worth.
A million dollars.
Done.
I'm kidding.
It's not for sale.
The amount of enjoyment I plan on getting watching Nate squirm? Priceless.
Come on, Bart.
Don't do this to my kid.
Enjoy yourselves tonight, Archibalds.
Drinks are on me.
Please tell me that you are heading home to get a good night's sleep after a trying day and not picking up your bags and going to the airport.
I'm sorry, Blair.
You know I'm terrible at good-byes.
Well, I won't let you say one now.
I know that things are bad, but they're never as bad as you think.
You were the one who taught me that.
Do you remember junior year, when I was standing out on that helipad, ready to flee to Europe after my "who's the daddy?" pregnancy scandal? And you weren't even pregnant.
You know, we can laugh about it now because you didn't let me go.
You told me that the scandal always passes, and so will Dan's expose.
Not as long as I live here.
In Los Angeles, no one cares if I date the wrong guy.
I mean, they don't care about anything I do.
I have the chance to reinvent myself.
Reinvention is for starlets from trailer parks who want to be you.
Seriously, do you know how few friendships make it out of high school? We finally got to the good part.
You can't leave now.
But you were the one that said we're better when we have our own territories.
Remember Paris? Right bank, left bank? Well, then move to the West Side and we'll meet in Central Park! And when we do, there will be enough light for both of us to shine.
Yeah, but I'd still be living in my own shadow.
I have to go.
But there's no Sarabeth's in L.
A.
Or serendipity.
Or me.
Please just think about it.
Leave a message, and I'll listen to it.
Hey, it's me.
Why aren't you answering your phone? Thank you for waiting.
I had no choice.
Your guards locked me out.
I wanted for us to have a chance to talk privately.
You know, I knew you were cold and ruthless, but I never thought you'd try to kill your own son.
We had a deal.
Your friend is out of jail.
You were supposed to be on a plane to Russia.
You never intended for me to make it to Moscow.
You arranged for the pilot to parachute to safety while I was left to die on the plane.
You have always had a wonderfully vivid imagination.
But I warned you earlier accidents can happen.
We should work together more often.
I'm just over coddling creative types.
There's a whole untapped niche in schemers for hire.
Have you seen Chuck? Bart said that security took him home, but I called Nate.
Chuck's not there and he's not answering his phone.
Well, he's here somewhere.
He hasn't left the building.
How do you know? The security guards at the exits are under strict instructions to inform us of all Bass departures.
I have my ways of insuring their loyalty.
Where's Bart? Last time I saw him, he was getting on the elevator.
All I've been trying to do for the past two years is just build something that I can be proud of.
Instead, I lost it, and my reputation and most of my trust fund.
Sorry I wasn't there for you sooner, son.
Just never wanted you to end up like me.
Hey.
You didn't end up so bad.
Whatever you decide to set your mind to next, I know you can achieve it.
Thanks, dad.
Hey.
Hi.
Your dad's right, you know.
You can start over.
When I first met you, you had the perfect story to get New York's attention.
What, Gossip Girl's identity? I promised her I'd stop looking after she helped find Serena.
Who knew she was perfectly fine.
She set you up to protect herself.
What do you have to lose by going through your research one more time? Nothing anymore.
In fact, I, uh I brought it home so that no one at "The Spectator" would find it.
Oh! Garcon, where are the stairs? The elevators are taking forever.
What are you doing here? And with a suitcase? I got an apartment in the building.
What? I finally realized where I wanna be, and it's here, where you are.
Where I used to be.
I have no interest in being anywhere around here anymore.
I don't believe that.
You run away to to Spain, upstate, boarding school, Santorini.
You always come back.
Well, that was then.
That was before I knew what this place could do to people, before I saw it turn you into Bart Bass.
I'm not Bart.
But what's wrong with wanting power? You have it.
Maybe if you stopped hating it, you'd stop hating yourself.
Then you can finally be happy where where you belong.
Okay, you know what? I have no interest in being psychoanalyzed by my evil biographer.
Serena, I know I've hurt you, but I still love you.
I've lost track of it at times.
I've made mistakes I've made massive, heartbreaking mistakes but I've never stopped loving you.
Well, excuse me if I don't fall for that, or you, ever again.
Please, just if you come upstairs for a second, I have something I can show you that'll prove it.
I've seen all I need to see.
I have a plane waiting.
Tell me did you try to have me killed because you hate me so much or because I know too much? You know, no matter how hard I have tried to turn you into a man, it still remains the one big failure of my life.
You're not a man.
A man accepts responsibility for his actions.
A man takes care of his family.
A man doesn't pay a mother to abandon her child and then tell that child his mother is dead.
A man doesn't try to have his own son killed! But you can tell the police what kind of a man you are.
Your naivete is adorable.
Even if I didn't have the police commissioner in my pocket, who do you think they're gonna believe? Huh? The man of the year or some sad, pathetic, little boy?! Uhh! Aah! Aah! Chuck give me your hand! You know I'm all talk! I would never really hurt you! Everything you say is a lie! Charles, this isn't who you are.
(Grunts) Please, son! Aah! (Gasps) Come on.
We have to get out of here.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.O.X.O., Gossip Girl.
I need your passion for social upheaval to help me write the book about the Upper East Side.
That's what I want.
Are you sure that I'm the one person you wanna be with? You have always been the one.
Daniel Humphrey has just released the latest installment of his serial a chapter on our very own Serena.
Why would you write this now? You were supposed to be different.
I used to be.
Got me nowhere.
So now I'm the same.
What I want isn't in Brooklyn.
I have a plan.
I have this whole time.
I wrote two versions of the Serena chapter, and that's that's the nice one.
I prefer the nasty one you published.
I know I've hurt you, but I've never stopped loving you.
Well, excuse me if I don't fall for that, or you, ever again.
When I first met you, you had the perfect story to get New York's attention.
What, Gossip Girl's identity? I promised her I'd stop looking after she helped find Serena.
She set you up to protect herself.
What do you have to lose by going through your research one more time? So Lily's still with Bart? Yes.
The only thing that matters is that you finally know the truth.
I do, and I'm sorry.
What on earth do you have to be sorry for? It won't be much longer, I promise.
I have a plan.
How many times do I have to tell you? Bart is not stupid enough to leave any evidence.
Stop your witch hunt and leave New York for Moscow tonight.
What are you doing? I couldn't live with myself if anything happened to you.
Don't get on the plane.
I made a deal.
Those were my father's terms.
The coast guard is investigating the area where the plane went off the radar after sending a mayday signal.
I hope that wasn't the one Chuck was on.
He just tried to have his own son killed.
Who do you think they're gonna believe, the man of the year, or some sad, pathetic, little boy?! Uhh! Aah! No! Chuck.
Give me your hand! You know I'm all talk.
I would never really hurt you.
Everything you say is a lie! Charles, this isn't who you are.
Please, son! Aah! Come on.
We have to get out of here.
Guys, there's a situation.
What's going on? There's a body.
A body? Whose? I can't tell you that.
Okay, thanks.
Do what you need to do.
Don't tell anyone you talked to me.
Arthur's stuck out front.
They're stopping all the cars from the event.
Give me the phone.
Why don't you let me help you? I know a lot of people here.
If you can just give me a name You ask a lot of questions.
Maybe you should give me your name.
I have to take this.
Oh.
Here's a lovely young woman who will tell everything that she knows which is nothing.
Hi.
Hey.
Are you Arthur? Excuse me, would you tell the pilot I'm gonna need another moment, please? Thank you.
When you're ready.
You dug up a lot of good dirt.
We just have to sift through it again.
You know the history.
I'm a fresh set of eyes.
The answer to "who is Gossip Girl?" Is right on this table.
Wait.
What? Ivy says I need to turn on the TV.
We're told a man has been found dead outside an event where the Manhattan real estate community was gathering to honor their man of the year, Bartholomew Bass.
The name of the deceased is being withheld until family members can be notified.
Sorry.
Hello? Yes, this is Mrs.
Bass.
What?! You've reached William.
Please leave a message.
Hey, it's me.
So you know how as long as Bart Bass was around, it wasn't safe to come to the city? Well, it's safe now.
Call me.
Shockwaves ran through this crowd moments ago as the news spread that the deceased was none other than Bart Bass himself, the man they had g adhered to honor.
Good night.
This comes on the heels of a series of bizarre events earlier tonight.
First, a false report that a Bass Industries jet had been downed.
Then Bass' son Charles caused a disturbance, requiring him to be removed by security.
Yes, this is Chuck Bass' limo, but he's not with me.
Where is he? I don't know.
I haven't heard from him since I dropped him off.
Mr.
Bass often finds his own way home from these things.
All clear.
All right.
Chuck Bass is considered a person of interest in this case, as he's wanted for questioning, although we have no information on his whereabouts.
Now being a person of interest does not necessarily mean he's a suspect at this point.
What it means is that police feel he'll have information on this case.
By the time I got to the party, Chuck was already gone.
I didn't even see him.
So you, uh, missed the outburst where he accused his father of trying to kill him? I don't know anything about that.
Do you? She's not talking to you.
She's a minor.
Anyone want some coffee? Look, Chuck likes drama.
Okay? He was probably wasted.
I'm sure it was just nothing, the usual father and son stuff.
And what do you know about his relationship with, uh, Blair Waldorf? Blair's relationship to Chuck is none of your business.
Besides, it's very complicated, with many ups and downs.
Would take long time to explain.
Look, Chuck Bass is missing.
If your daughter's with him, she could be in a lot of trouble.
What kind of trouble? Aiding and abetting.
Maybe worse.
Aiding and abetting what? You don't really think that Chuck had something to do with what happened to Bart? You mind if I check her bed, see if it was slept in? Yes, I mind.
You're not searching anything here without a warrant.
In fact, I think this conversation is over.
I understand you, uh, recently went to jail yourself, Mr.
Archibald.
Hate to see ya back there.
So I'm sorry, but nobody's gonna be saying another word without a lawyer present a lawyer who isn't me.
Well, this is outrageous.
I mean, it's not like Blair and Chuck killed the man.
Oh, no.
What? Oh, no.
Who is it? Room service.
I have terrible news.
Bart's dead.
What are you doing here? I don't know if you've heard, but, uh, a lot of people are looking for ya.
Blair, you can come on out.
Uncle Jack's here to help.
Hey.
Uh, you're, uh, you're still in Manhattan, and you're here.
I spent all night reading and rereading, and then I realized I can't leave until I know if what you wrote is true.
It is, every single word of it.
Do you understand how I feel now? No.
No, actually, I'm more confused than ever.
Which one is the real you the one that wrote this chapter or the one in "Vanity Fair"? And "both" is not an acceptable answer.
You know, yeah, I still had a tracking device on your limo from back in the day when I hated you, and I thought it was a little odd when your limo driver made a midnight trip to a romantic inn in Windham.
Anyway you kill him or not? 'Cause if you didn't, running sure makes it look like you did.
Chuck did nothing wrong.
That's not entirely true.
I didn't help him.
Who shoved who first? Who got hit? I I don't even know.
It was self-defense.
Bart tried to kill you on that plane.
I saved myself, then I fought back.
I I don't feel guilty, but that doesn't mean I'm not.
Anyways, Bart made it clear he owns captain Donnelley.
Can you help us get out of here? A a nice deserted island with no extradition treaties? We don't need money.
We can live off the land.
As much as I'd love to see you spearfishing in a coconut bikini, I, uh had another thought.
Were there security cameras on that roof? Bart turned them off.
Because he was going to kill you.
Who saw you up there? Him and Blair.
And I won't say a word.
Even if they torture me, I won't speak.
I, uh, had a different kind of torture in mind.
Marriage.
Spousal privilege means that a wife cannot be forced to testify against her husband.
Not like this, Blair.
Why not? We're in love, and one way or another, we both achieved our goals.
And every trembling bone in my tired and scared body wants to marry you.
It's twisted but it's, uh, very you.
Jack is right.
Chuck and Blair hold hands? Chuck and Blair go to the movies? You said you never wanted us to be boring.
Well, we definitely aren't that now.
I was a stupid child when I said those things.
Life with you could never be boring.
Blair Cornelia Waldorf, will you marry me? Yes.
Yes, I will.
Oh! William, hello.
Lily, I am so sorry.
My deepest condolences for Bart's passing.
Yes.
I'm still trying to process the news.
It's all very shocking and upsetting.
Well, without Rufus and your mother in your life, I thought you could use the support.
You know, the police are looking for Chuck, the press is on your heels, and you've got a funeral to plan.
Oh, God.
A funeral.
Well the good news is, we can do the same thing we did the last time Bart died.
Honestly, I would be grateful to have you by my side.
I don't know how I'm gonna get through this day alone.
Well, let's start by getting you upstairs and getting you some of that tea you love so much.
Okay, you need to explain everything, from the beginning the very, very beginning.
Yeah.
Uh all right, well I'd been going to school with you guys for a while, but that night was the first night that I'd been to one of your parties.
Of course, I soon realized that I'd been invited by accident.
Hey, Matt.
No, n you know, my name's actually Good game against Trinity last week, huh? Game? Yeah, no, I'm not I'm not who you think I am.
Ahem.
Watch it.
Hey.
Mm-hmm.
But I didn't care if I wasn't supposed to be there.
One I got inside, I wasn't leaving because that's when I saw you.
I'd seen you before at school, on the steps of the Met, but I'd never seen you like this.
What are you doing, standing there all by yourself? Don't you ever go to parties? I, um, yeah.
Sure, yeah.
I yeah, I went to uh, birthdays as a kid.
Well, my own.
I, um, I have a cousin who's Jewish, and her bar mitzvah was rockin'.
Ah.
Oh.
You were joking.
Yeah, I was.
No, so I mean, I was yeah, I was, too.
I was joking.
No, I wasn't.
I was her bat mitzvah was it sucked.
It was Hello Kitty-themed.
I love Hello Kitty.
So do I.
Uh I was joking again.
You probably should get out more.
Well, you see what happens when I do? And this is so bad? O.
M.
G! Kati just puked on her Prada! She is taking pictures with her cell phone.
We have to go wish her happy barfday! That's amazing.
I wish I remembered any of that, but I don't probably because I had too much champagne.
Or because you thought I was a lacrosse player named Matt.
No, I didn't realize that.
No, but that's good news.
It's great news.
Yeah, just have the papers sent over.
Thanks.
Was that about the search warrant? It was about "The Spectator"" I mean, now that Bart's dead, my name's the only one on the loan.
If I can pay off what I owe, it'll be all mine.
That's amazing.
And if we can figure out this "Gossip Girl" expose, you'll have the perfect story to make it happen.
Yeah.
I just wish I felt like celebrating.
I'm sure Chuck's not calling 'cause he doesn't want to get me in trouble, but I really need to know he's okay.
If he's with Blair, he's okay.
She won't let anything bad happen to him.
Okay.
Hold on one second, okay? Of course we have to get married in a courthouse.
Maybe we should get out of here.
Relax.
We're just two crazy kids dying to tie the knot.
If anyone recognizes you, then that knot will become a noose around your neck.
I got the license.
Backdated, of course, lest someone suspects your union was motivated by something other than your tender feelings.
The Justice of the Peace is waiting for you.
Okay.
Let's go.
Let's do this.
Blair, you don't have to.
I want to.
I know this isn't your dream wedding.
Last night's dress, no flowers, the cake from the doughnut shop down the street.
I already had my princess wedding.
There were enough peonies to last a lifetime.
Maybe you don't need flowers, but your mother, Cyrus, Serena you should be surrounded by the people you love.
You love me.
I love the both of you.
It is just not worth the risk of bringing everyone here.
Look, you might be okay with it, but I'm not sure I wanna start the rest of our lives this way.
Chuck.
Don't worry, Daphne.
I'm heading over to Dan's right now.
I know you need the final chapter today.
Hey.
You Georgina Sparks? Depends on who's asking.
You KGB? JXB.
Jack Xavier Bass.
Chuck's Uncle Jack.
Don't believe I've had the pleasure.
Blair says when it comes to a scheme, your skills are second to none.
She doesn't exaggerate.
Then what are you waitin' on, Sparks? Let's see if the woman lives up to the name.
Oh! Thank you for letting me lean on you today.
I would simply be lost.
William! Ivy, right? I would hope, on a day like today, you would be able to give me some measure of peace.
Oh, if there is one thing you're not getting today, it's peace.
And now that William's here, we can tell you together.
You know, they say success is nothing without someone to share it with.
I have no idea what game this young woman is playing.
I don't believe I've even seen you since, um uh, Cece's wake.
What? We've been working together for months.
He's in love with me.
I have William's texts on my phone.
My children know how to make it look like someone sent them a text message when they haven't, so I'm sure you know the same tricks.
He he helped transfer Cece's money to me.
You can ask Lola.
Well, Lola's out of the country doing a film in Budapest, so unfortunately, she's, uh, not available.
I'm gonna go get the doorman.
What are you doing? I'm getting exactly what I wanted to be with Lily, the love of my life, the mother of my children.
And I thank you I truly thank you for the role you played in making that possible.
I'll tell everyone.
I'll tell the media.
The media? I don't think so.
You're a lifetime movie called "Nobody gives a damn: The Ivy Dickens story.
" I don't know what you have to complain about.
You got Lola's money.
Now go back to Florida, run along and be the queen of the swamp people.
You're the devil! All right, miss.
Don't make me have to call the police.
I loved you, William, with all my heart! I did! Ivy and Serena's daddy doctor? Didn't see that one coming.
Oh.
What do you two want? You.
Look, don't be mad.
I came back because I wanna understand.
No, I'm I'm not mad.
I just Okay, have you ever wanted something so badly, but you just know you're not gonna get it? Oh, that's right.
I I forgot who I'm talking to.
Of course you haven't.
But that that was that was my whole life.
And the moment you walked away from me, I knew there was no way I could ever pull you out of your world and into mine.
But I couldn't give up.
Wait.
The school trip to the "Intrepid" museum? Yeah.
I overheard two girls talking about you in your white dress, getting wet, and, um one girl thought that you would be laughingstock.
You know, and that and that everyone would be talking about you, but then her friend said, "that's the point.
You're no one until you're talked about.
" So you came home, and you told all of this to Jenny, and that was the beginning of "Gossip Girl"? So you've had the power to reveal her identity this entire time? Come.
We have a mission.
"We"? "We" who? What what mission? Do you two seriously not have any idea why I'm here? What have you been doing for the last 12 hours? So obviously, Gossip Girl's known you all since ninth grade, but it's doubtful that someone older would've cared about a bunch of freshmen, so she's the same age.
Or younger.
That's what we always figured.
But you went to different colleges after graduation.
She couldn't have followed all of you.
By that time, it didn't matter.
She'd already built up her network of sources.
I mean, she could've been anywhere in the world.
Like at Sarah Lawrence, where Eric Van Der Woodsen goes? Or maybe London, where Jenny Humphrey lives? I thought of that.
Eric maybe, but Gossip Girl was pretty brutal on Jenny.
I mean, no one would do that to themselves.
Are you kidding? Battling Blair, the fashion line even you had a crush on her.
Little J. was my idol in seventh grade.
But I get your point.
Is there anyone Gossip Girl ever went easy on? Someone she cared about? That could be a clue.
The only selfless thing she ever did was shut down after Chuck and Blair's accident.
Although, she did lead Dan and Blair to Juliet after Serena was drugged.
That was the right thing to do.
And wasn't there a lot of stuff that she knew but didn't post until Serena went to war with her at graduation? Maybe Gossip Girl was really our guardian angel.
Spotted Chuck Bass back in Manhattan.
We hear he's on his way to turn himself in.
Who's up for a little stakeout at the big house? Well, so much for that theory.
Yeah.
Jack? Come on.
Let's go.
Take your time.
I mean, whatever.
Come on, let's go! Did you just see what I saw? What are the chances that Serena, Dan, Nate, and Georgina Sparks all decided to check out the Warhol exhibit together? Zero.
Come on, ally.
Hey, mom! Chuck! Sorry I couldn't call.
You really scared us, man.
Oh! I'm so glad you're safe.
You know, just a little confused as to why we're all here.
Are you saying good-bye before you turn yourself in? Why does everyone look like they're here for a funeral? When you're here for a wedding.
A woman like Blair deserves to be married with style, surrounded by friends and family.
No Bass man would let himself be stopped by a little thing like a tristate A.
P.
B.
Hey, enough with the small talk.
We all have a job to do.
Blair and Chuck, stay out of sight.
Then we meet at the Bethesda Fountain and get married.
Miss Eleanor, go go get the dress! A and and the rings! The rings! You! You! Rings! And and, uh, mister Chuck and Blair are getting married?! This is the biggest "Gossip Girl" story ever.
" Oh, my gosh! You look amazing! B.
, the dress is perfection! Well, a lifelong relationship with Elie Saab does have its perks.
My mother did well.
Hey, have you seen Dan? I'm a little nervous.
The last time he was in charge of flowers, we ended up with Damien Dalgaard's purple tulip.
Well, speaking of, is Dan here as your date? I mean, after he published his hate piece, I'm surprised you're even talking to him at all.
Yeah, he had his reasons.
I don't know.
I'm I'm still trying to figure it out.
And come on, it's not like Chuck didn't do his fair share of terrible things to you.
Ancient history! And besides, Chuck is one of us, whereas Dan, despite his years of trying, never will be.
What does "one of us" even mean after all this time? He's friends with our friends.
We we both dated him.
His father married my mother.
His his new apartment is in my building.
S.
, we all hoped that Humble Humphrey would overcome his Brooklyn roots to join a higher social strata.
I mean, after all, it's the American dream.
But let's face it.
In his case, the dream has died.
Just give him one more chance.
You don't know the whole story.
I know what I need to know, and that is, Serena Van Der Woodsen will never end up with a powerless striver.
Where are you going? The fountain is that way.
Yeah, I might be a little late for that.
There's something I gotta take care of first.
Something? Like what? If this is about the final chapter, you better not be giving it to "Vanity Fair" before I've read it.
I'm not giving it to "Vanity Fair".
What? Wait! Where are you going?! Stop it! Oh! Should I even ask what happened on that rooftop? The less you know, the better.
Ah.
Then for once, I guess it's a good thing that I'm out of the loop.
Chuck! Hey! Sorry to interrupt your last fling, but I got the rings.
The choice was between Byzantine cross and Egyptian snake.
I assume, like attracted like, and you went with the snake? You know me well, nephew.
Nate.
This is for you.
It's my final chapter.
You mean my final chapter, and it's not for you.
Wait.
This is about Gossip Girl.
That's yours to publish in "The Spectator.
" I know you gave up your search to help Serena.
Now you have all your answers.
Dan, this is incredible.
I have to find sage.
I mean, she can run this down to the office.
Thanks, man.
I mean, this could change my life.
Mine, too, hopefully.
I should've known better than to back a horse from D.
U.
M.
B.
O.
All right, don't let anyone stop you or ask any questions.
Just go straight to my computer and start typing.
Post paragraph by paragraph if you need to.
Got it.
What is taking Gossip Girl so long? I don't know.
But if Gossip Girl doesn't care about out tip, I bet the police will.
Thea! The police? What? Chuck's a fugitive from the law.
If it's not on "G.
G.
," at least it'll be on the news.
Hi, I have information on the location of Chuck Bass.
To quote Siddhartha, we are not going in circles.
We are going upward.
The path is a spiral.
We have already climbed many ste Cyrus, I think that is enough.
Perhaps we could skip to the "I do" part.
Where's the rings? Do you, Chuck, take Blair to be your lawfully wedded wife? Three words.
Eight letters.
Blair, do you take Chuck to be your lawfully wedded husband? One word.
Three letters.
Yes! Then by the power invested in me by the great state of New York, I now pronounce you man and wife! You may kiss the bride! Chuck Bass! Chuck Bass? You need to come with us.
You, too, Ms.
Waldorf.
I'm with you.
Me, too.
And me.
Right on cue, Gossip Girl.
It's not Gossip Girl.
It's "The Spectator".
I'm shocked.
I thought it was Dorota.
What? Seriously? No way.
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
That little bitch! Hey, Upper East Siders.
Gossip Girl here, and I have the biggest news ever.
"Serena! You're back from boarding school.
" "Yeah.
Hi, Blair.
So I gotta go ".
Come on, Bell.
Can you just try a little harder? I'm sorry.
If I'm being really honest, Rachel, I don't think you can pull off high school anymore.
Thanks a lot.
Sorry.
Oh, come on! You are always on that thing.
This audition's really important to me.
Plus, the book is a best-seller and it has a built-in movie audience.
Dan Humphrey is a really good writer.
O.
M.
G.
You are not going to believe who Gossip Girl is.
Wait.
Gossip Girl is real? The Upper East Side was like something from Fitzgerald or Thackeray teenagers acting like adults, adults acting like teenagers, guarding secrets, spreading gossip, all with the trappings of truly opulent wealth.
And membership in this community was so elite, you couldn't even buy your way in.
It was a birthright a birthright I didn't have and my greatest achievements would never earn me.
All I had to compare to this world was what I'd read in books.
But that gave me the idea.
If I wasn't born into this world, maybe i could write myself into it.
I'd overheard enough conversations to be able to mimic the language of the Constance girls, but every writer needs his muse.
And it wasn't until that photo of Serena in the white dress that I knew I had something strong enough to actually create a legend and launch a web site.
Within weeks, I was getting dozens of e-mails with stories about Upper East Siders, so I posted them anonymously.
And then I got more.
Oh, my God.
Before lon it was a monster.
Everyone was sending tips.
I am so glad Gossip Girl finally got her balls back.
And when Serena came back from boarding school I wrote my first post about me Lonely Boy the outsider, the underdog.
I might've been a joke, but at least people were talking about me.
This is a hell of a thing you pulled off, kid.
I'm in awe.
I hacked it and stole it from him.
That makes me way more awesome.
No, you stole it after I shut it down.
And when you started it back up, I just stole it again.
I should've known it was you on the surveillance tape Diana sent me.
You were the only one who wasn't there with us that night.
And you're the only one who owns a hoodie.
The one I felt stupid about was graduation, when I asked Gossip Girl to meet me, and then Dan showed up.
Son.
Dad.
I figured you'd be here waiting for Chuck and Blair.
We need to talk.
I should drink.
Me, too.
Uh, vodka on the rocks.
Big glass, not too many rocks.
Three olives.
Dan, I cannot believe you are the one responsible for all of this poison.
The damage you've done to your friends, to your family, to your own sister! Jenny wanted to get on "Gossip Girl".
She's known it was me for years.
If there's ever anything she really didn't want posted, all she had to do was ask.
You told the whole world about her losing her virginity! No, no, no.
No, she sent that tip in herself.
She wanted to get out of New York, but she didn't feel like she had the strength to leave on her own.
So she knew if Blair found out the truth, she wouldn't have a choice.
Her leaving town was the best thing that ever happened to Jenny.
Yeah.
I mean, look, dad, I I know I know I've screwed up, and plenty of times.
But I've always tried to do the right thing, like you taught me.
Tell me everything.
Dan was as hard on himself as he was any of us.
And he wouldn't have had anything to post if everyone hadn't been sending in tips.
I never sent in one tip.
Saint Nate.
Come on, what was the worst thing Gossip Girl ever wrote about you? If anyone should be mad it it should be me or me and Blair.
We're here! You're free! So everything's okay? Well, Cyrus is finishing up at the police station.
But we refused to talk.
And since there's no actual evidence that Chuck was even on that roof And no witness Except his wife.
They had to no choice but to let us go.
Bart's death will be ruled as an accident.
Thank you.
No, this is actually for her.
Miss Blair, I I so worried about you and, uh, Mr.
Chuck, and brain exploding from Lonely Boy news.
I need vodka.
We all need lots of vodka, Dorota.
And champagne.
My mother and Lily are at Citarella right now getting food.
We're gonna have a wedding reception.
And don't even think that you will be invited, Humphrey.
We read while we were waiting.
You have a lot of explaining to do.
What do you wanna know, Blair? What do you look so amused for? Uh, it's just that I felt the same way until I realized that I'm fine with it.
Fine? He stopped posting after our accident.
He shut down the site.
I mean, we always knew it was one of us, right? I always thought it was Dorota! You know, I actually thought it was Eric for a little bit, and then I thought it was you, Rufus.
My dad? Come on.
Hey! It could've been me.
I always thought it was Nate.
Did anyone think it could be me? My money was on the blonde broad in London.
Why do you all think that this is funny? Gossip Girl ruined our lives! Is your life really ruined, Blair? If you think about it, we're all on track to do exactly what we wanted to do.
But he schemed and lied and spread horrible stories.
Blair, I think you're just mad because Dan was the one who was pulling the strings all along.
This whole time, I had more power than you.
But what he did with that power was write a love letter not just to me but to all of us.
It made me realize I don't want to run away, that that you guys are my family, and I belong here.
And so does Dan.
Well, I guess that means it's all over now, that we can all grow up and move on.
Yeah.
Gossip Girl's dead.
Good to see you again.
Mr.
Archibald, what do you say to speculation that you'll be announcing your bid for the mayor's race any day now? I say New York is the greatest city in the world.
Who wouldn't wanna be mayor? You'd be the youngest mayor ever in the history of the city.
Only if I win.
And I haven't even said if I'm running.
The polls already have you out in front.
I promise I'll answer any questions you have tomorrow, but right now there's somewhere I have to be.
Thank you, Mr.
Henry.
You very good boy, help tidy up for party.
Look who's here! Daddy! Ah! There is my grandson! Henry! Come here, boy! Come here! Come here! Come here! Come on! Ah! How are you? The place looks great.
It was all Blair.
Thank you.
No.
No, I told you that Tuesday is not soon enough.
I need the samples in the showroom by Monday.
Okay, I have to go.
I have guests.
Xiexie.
Zaijian.
Do you have any idea how many times I'd wondered if we'd ever make it to this day? And now here we are.
No doubt thanks to your wonderful parenting.
Mm! Oh, my I know.
I know.
Last-minute inspiration.
How is she? Oh, great.
Not nervous at all.
I am.
I need a drink.
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
Hey, looking good.
You may be rid of Dan Humphrey, but you'll never be rid of me.
There will always be someone on the outside, wanting to get in.
Who am I now? That's one secret I'll never tell.
X.
O.
X.
O.
, Gossip Girl.
