Gossip Girl scripts for all seasons/series
==========

#Why?

I'm training a recurrent neural network. Was looking for something to use a source, and my girlfriend really likes this show (although I still like saying "XOXO!", even though I think the show is shite). So I scoured the web and automatically downloaded the scripts.

#Any issues with the source content?

Oh aye. It seems that several different people, all with different styles, many of whom I _think_ may not speak English as a first language, have transcribed these episodes. And so the whole thing is a mess. Which brings me on to try and fix the formatting throughout (and stopping characters from randomly speaking Spanish, or having a character called "Sererna"), so this should actually be the best source if you're just looking for the scripts themselves.

Also only the first season transcriber seems to have bothered with names, stage directions, etc. The later seasons looks almost as if it's been done automatically with speech-to-text algorithm.

#Legal?

I hope so! I imagine this is under fair use, but please contact me if it breaks any rules.

#Any issues with your scraping of it?

Yes... it may have picked up or missed off a few different bits, such as some HTML that isn't properly formatted. Also, I passed everything through an HTML entity decoder, so some characters like Ã© may come out funky or be cut off.
